Called the blockchain, it has been heralded as a potentially disruptive force in finance by major institutions, which claim that bitcoin is just the ""opening act"" in something bigger.

Blockchain works like a huge, decentralized ledger for the digital currency bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. It's this technology that banks feel can be utilized in areas from remittances to securities exchanges.

Currently, a consortium of more than 25 banks, led by fintech (financial technology) company R3, is developing a framework for applying blockchain technology to markets. CNBC highlights what some of these major banks have been saying this year about the potential of the blockchain.



Goldman Sachs

""What if I told you that bitcoin was just the opening act … with the blockchain ready to take center stage,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note in December, adding that the technology could ""change everything."" Goldman Sachs noted a number of industries and uses that the blockchain could be applied to including voting systems, vehicle registrations, wire fees, gun checks, trade settlements and cataloguing ownership of art works. ""By removing the need for a middle man, one lowers potential security concerns from hacking to corruption as well as speeding up manual processes that are antiquated and can take too long,"" the investment bank said.



JPMorgan

JPMorgan has spent about $9 billion this year on technology investments across the company and a big focus has been on the blockchain. In a note to employees, which was given to CNBC, Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, said the financial giant has established teams to look into the blockchain among other technology such as robotics.



Barclays

Barclays said in May that bitcoin created a more ""elegant solution than our current payment system"" in many ways but it also ""fell short"" in a number of areas. The British bank said that it envisages a number of other cryptocurrencies will continue to emerge that won't have the flaws of first generation bitcoin, it said in the note. So it's not predicting the end of cryptocurrencies but sees a place for them in the future of blockchain. The first big area cryptocurrencies could work well in is bank transfers and remittances, according to Barclays, as it could make it cheaper and even ""reduce the capital requirements of banks, as it would reduce considerably the counterparty risks.""



A second area of interest is the use of blockchain in securities exchanges with Barclays saying the technology can be ""been abstracted to carry any sort of asset which can be represented digitally."" A third area is in the registration of assets to help insurers keep track of objects, for example. An insurer could keep track of claims and if a car breaks down and an insurer pays for the repairs, both events could be recorded on the blockchain, so it would be more difficult to make a second claim. Other examples Barclays includes is being able to create ""tamper-proof"" online voting and supply chain management.

UBS

UBS has been one of the most open banks about its plans with the blockchain. It has a team called ""Crypto 2.0"" in London conducting research on the technology. The Swiss investment bank said it has explored more than 20 use cases of blockchain and is incubating the best ideas. One of the experiments it carried out was with so-called ""smart contracts"" which it developed into a ""smart bond"". This involved using the blockchain to recreate a bond's issuance, interest calculation, coupon payments and maturation processes. UBS said in this scenario there was no need for pre and post trade intermediaries as the software on the blockchain was specifically configured to automatically handle the flow of information and money between the issuer and the buyer. The test required the creation of a virtual coin which it called ""bondcoin"", which enabled the transfer of value between the parties. Rather than a new virtual currency, bondcoin is linked to real-world currencies and connected to a central bank account.

2		Stock Market News for December 31, 2015	[]	"The second last trading session was somewhat indicative of the sordid mood markets suffered for most part of this year. Another rout in oil prices dragged the benchmarks down to the red on Wednesday. Also, a slide in Apple sparked a technology sector selloff. Investors were also unnerved after the IMF chief warned of disappointing global economic growth next year. Eventually, yesterday's loss left Dow in the red and S&P 500 is up just 0.2% in 2015.

For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined about 0.7% to close at 17,603.87. The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) dropped over 0.7% to close at 2,063.36. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,065.85, decreasing 0.8%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged 7.5% to settle at 17.29. A total of around 2.4 billion shares were traded on Wednesday on the NYSE. Decliners outpaced advancing stocks on the NYSE. For 86% stocks that declined, 13% advanced.

On many occasions this year the slump in crude prices and the subsequent decline in the energy sector has dragged benchmarks lower. On the second last trading session of the year, it was again the slump in crude prices that damaged the markets the most. The WTI Crude Oil slumped 3.5% to settle at $36.60 and the Brent Crude Oil nosedived 3.7% to close at $36.46.

Oil prices plunged in electronic trading late Tuesday, after American Petroleum Institute reported an unexpected jump in U.S. crude supplies. Eventually on Wednesday, crude slumped as government data revealed that inventories of U.S. commercial crude surprisingly increased by 2.6 million barrels for the week ended Dec 25. This unexpected data from the Energy Information Administration was in contrast to projections from analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal that U.S. crude inventories will decline by 1 million barrels.

This obviously dragged the energy sector lower and the 1.4% drop in Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) was yesterday's biggest decline among the S&P industry groups. XLE is now down 24.4% year-to-date, the biggest decliner.

Exxon Mobil Corporation ( XOM ) slumped 1.3% and Chevron Corporation ( CVX ) was also down nearly 1.3%. Chevron was the biggest drag on the Dow yesterday. Other key energy shares such as Schlumberger Limited ( SLB ), Occidental Petroleum Corporation ( OXY ), ConocoPhillips ( COP ) and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation ( APC ) declined 1.2%, 1.7%, 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively.

Separately, the technology sector also suffered losses, pulled down by Apple Inc. ( AAPL ). Shares of the iPhone maker dropped 1.3% after sources mentioned that the company had to pay $348 million to settle a tax claim in Italy. Apple was the biggest drag on Nasdaq and S&P 500.

Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) dropped 0.8% yesterday and key stocks such as Facebook, Inc. ( FB ), Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ ), Intel Corporation ( INTC ) and Cisco Systems, Inc. ( CSCO ) dropped 1%, 0.9%, 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively.

Dismal global economic growth prospects in 2016 also kept the bearish mood alive. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said that China's economic slowdown and rising rates in the US are sparking global economic uncertainty. Economies that are reliant on commodities are facing headwinds due to the slump in raw material prices and a slowdown in global trade. Financial threats are increasing in emerging economies and many economies have weak financial sectors. Lagarde said: ""All of that means global growth will be disappointing and uneven in 2016"".

Coming to economic data, the National Association of Realtors reported that its pending home sales index dropped 0.9% in November to 106.9. The drop came after the same had increased in October, following two months of downtrend.

Though Nasdaq is in a comfortable seat to finish the year with decent gains, yesterday's decline left little scope for the Dow to finish 2015 in the green. The blue-chip index is now down 219 points, or 1.2%%, in 2015. Today's trading session is most likely to be thin, and offers hardly any hope for the Dow to end 2015 with strong gains.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up just 5 points this year and thus would hope to see a positive momentum on the last trading session of the year. If the S&P 500 ends in the red, it would be its worst year since 2008. A finish in the green, though with meagre gains, will help it close with yearly gains for the fourth straight time.

4	2015-12-31	The current state of ransomware: CTB-Locker	['About The Author']	"In our series on the current state of ransomware, we previously looked at CryptoWall and TorrentLocker. In this post, we’ll examine a variant called CTB-Locker.

CTB-Locker is a ransomware variant that encrypts files on a victim’s hard disk before demanding a ransom be paid to decrypt the files.

CTB-Locker is noteworthy for its high infection rates, use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Tor and bitcoins, and its multi-lingual capabilities.

Infection Vectors



The authors of CTB-Locker are using an affiliate program to drive infections by outsourcing the infection process to a network of affiliates or partners in exchange for a cut of the profits.

The affiliate model is a tried, tested and very successful strategy at achieving large volumes of malware infections. It has been used to generate huge revenues for fake antivirus, click fraud schemes, and a wide variety of other types of malware. It is now being used to distribute ransomware in general and CTB-Locker in particular.

The affiliate scheme for CTB-Locker was first publicly highlighted by the researcher Kafeine, in mid-2014. A 2015 Reddit post claims to be from an actual participant of the affiliate program and provides interesting insight into its workings.

The CTB-Locker authors use a similar strategy to many exploit kit authors by offering a hosted option where the operator pays a monthly fee and the authors host all the code. This makes becoming an affiliate simple and relatively risk-free. The Reddit poster claimed to make 15,000 (presumably dollars) a month, with costs of around 7,000. The author also mentions that he only focuses on victims from “tier 1” countries such as the US, UK, Australia and Canada, as he makes so little money from other regions that it is not worth the time.

Using an affiliate model for distribution means that there are a wide range of different infection vectors for CTB-Locker. We have seen it be distributed through several exploit kits including Rig and Nuclear. However, it is through malicious spam campaigns that the majority of CTB-Locker infections have been observed.

The most commonly seen spam campaigns that distribute CTB-Locker use a downloader component known as Dalexis or Elenoocka. The spam messages themselves follow a wide variety of formats, including missed fax messages, financial statements, overdue invoices, account suspensions and missed mms messages. Here are several examples:

A large proportion of modern day malicious spam arrives as an exe file inside a zip or rar archive. An unusual aspect of Dalexis is that it almost always arrives in a less common archive, typically a cab file.

The archive contains the malicious sample itself, often with a .scr extension and a further archive that contains a decoy document that will be displayed to convince the victim that the attachment was harmless.

The malicious Dalexis sample uses several techniques in an attempt to avoid sandboxes and automated analysis systems, including sleeping for a period of time. Dalexis then downloads the CTB-Locker sample over HTTP in an encrypted form, decodes and executes it.

Execution

When CTB-Locker executes, it drops a copy of itself to the temp directory and creates a scheduled task to enable reboot persistence.

The file system is then iterated through and all files with extensions that match CTB-Locker’s extension list will be encrypted. The desktop background image is changed and CTB-Locker overlays the ransom message and a clickable interface onto the center of the screen.

Unlike some crypto-ransomware variants, CTB-Locker does not require an active internet connection before it starts encrypting files.

Encryption

CTB-Locker stands for “Curve-Tor-Bitcoin-Locker.” The “Curve” part of the name is taken from its use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). ECC is a form of public key cryptography based on elliptic curves over finite fields. Its strength is derived from the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. Most file-encrypting Ransomware that uses public key cryptography tends to use RSA, which is based on prime factorization. A benefit that ECC has over RSA is that equivalent security levels can be achieved with much smaller key sizes. For example, a 256-bit ECC key has equivalent security to a 3072-bit RSA key.

The key size advantages that ECC offers may have been a contributing factor in the author’s decision-making process, as they embed a public key into the malware sample and a smaller key takes up less space.

CTB-Locker uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to scramble files. The encryption itself is carried out using AES and then the means to decrypt the files are encrypted with the ECC public key. This ensures that only the CTB-Locker authors who have the corresponding private key are able to decrypt the files. For a detailed analysis of the encryption scheme used by CTB-Locker see, this analysis from “zairon.”

CTB-Locker will encrypt files with the following extensions:

pwm,kwm,txt,cer,crt,der,pem,doc,cpp,c,php,js,cs,pas,bas,pl,py,docx,rtf,docm,xls,xlsx,safe,

groups,xlk,xlsb,xlsm,mdb,mdf,dbf,sql,md,dd,dds,jpe,jpg,jpeg,cr2,raw,rw2,rwl,dwg,dxf,dxg,psd,3fr,accdb,

ai,arw,bay,blend,cdr,crw,dcr,dng,eps,erf,indd,kdc,mef,mrw,nef,nrw,odb,odm,odp,ods,odt,orf,p12,p7b,p7c,

pdd,pdf,pef,pfx,ppt,pptm,pptx,pst,ptx,r3d,raf,srf,srw,wb2,vsd,wpd,wps,7z,zip,rar,dbx,gdb,bsdr,bsdu,

bdcr,bdcu,bpdr,bpdu,ims,bds,bdd,bdp,gsf,gsd,iss,arp,rik,gdb,fdb,abu,config,rgx

This list has been expanded as newer variants have been released.

Originally, encrypted files all had a “.ctbl” extension, however, that was soon changed to have a random extension. It appears that the authors have borrowed at least some of their encryption code from OpenSSL, as large amounts of related strings can be found in the unpacked code.

Network Communication

Since CTB-Locker can start encrypting files without having to contact a command and control server, there does not need to be any network communication until the victim attempts to decrypt their files.

When this happens, all communications are carried out over Tor (this is where the “Tor” from Curve-Tor-Bitcoin-Locker comes in), usually through proxy websites that act as relays to the Tor Hidden Service that hosts the back-end infrastructure.

When a victim has paid the ransom, CTB-Locker will contact the command and control server, sending a block of data that contains the information needed to derive the key that will decrypt the victim’s files. This block of data can only be decrypted with the master key stored on the server.

Ransom Demand

When all the victim’s files have been encrypted, the ransom message is displayed by changing the desktop background and by overlaying the centre of the screen with the main ransom demand and clickable interface.

This screen informs the victim that “Your personal files are encrypted by CTB-Locker,” they are told that they have “96 hours to submit payment,” and they are warned that any attempt to remove the malware from the infected system will result in the decryption key being destroyed – this time limit was lower in earlier versions. The victim can click the “Next” button to start the decryption process or the “View” button to see the list of encrypted files.

CTB-Locker is highly multi-lingual with the ransom note offered in a variety of languages, accessible through the various flag icons at the top of the screen. The choice of languages appears to be at least partially customizable by the affiliate who has purchased this particular CTB-Locker instance, and the available options have grown over time. A recent sample had the following language options – English, French, German, Spanish, Latvian, Dutch and Italian.

Latvian is an unusual language option, as Latvia is not generally seen as a major target for ransomware and other types of crimeware. This possibly represents the authors looking to break into new markets where awareness is lower, or perhaps the particular affiliate has local knowledge and is better able to launch a successful campaign in that country.

Recent variants of CTB-Locker also offer a way for the victim to verify that their files can be decrypted by unscrambling five randomly selected files for free. This appears to have been introduced as a way to gain the confidence of the victim and increase the likelihood that the full ransom will be paid.

Ransom Payment

When the victim clicks through the ransom interface they are given detailed instructions on how much to pay and how to pay it.

CTB-Locker requires Bitcoins (BTC) to pay the ransom (“Bitcoin” in Curve-Tor-Bitcoin-Locker). The exact amount of BTC is set by the affiliate who has purchased CTB-Locker, though the authors give guidance to help set the ransom amount at a level that is likely to generate maximum revenue. Figure 12 above shows an example demanding 3 BTC. An approximate equivalent amount in the local currency is also displayed – e.g., 690 Dollars or 660 Euros.

One downside to using Tor hidden services is that reliability can be an issue, meaning that the command and control server cannot be reached when the victim attempts to pay the ransom.

In an attempt to combat this, CTB-Locker attempts to use multiple different Tor proxy servers to reach the hidden service, and also offers manual instructions should the malware sample be removed from the infected machine. These involve visiting the Tor hidden service through a web browser and pasting into a form the public key that the victim is given.

Reliability

Reading through various public support forum postings suggests that in many cases paying the ransom will result in CTB-Locker decrypting the victim’s files. The “Test Decryption” feature is a good indicator that decryption is possible.

However, the victim must still trust that the cybercriminals will make good on their promise after handing over the ransom amount in BTC. There is also the possibility that the server components that host the private keys needed to perform decryption will be taken down, temporarily or permanently, which can make decryption impossible. In that circumstance it is likely that the cybercriminals will continue to accept ransom payments despite knowing there is no way to decrypt the victim’s files.

Statistics

CTB-Locker infections are mostly seen in Western Europe, North America and Australia. These are generally speaking the tier 1 countries described in the Reddit post mentioned above. Victims in these countries appear to be targeted based on the ransomware author’s previous experience of successful payments.

When looking at numbers of samples we can see that the number of actual CTB-Locker samples is much lower than the number of Dalexis samples that are used to download CTB-Locker. This makes sense since the downloader is spammed out in extremely large volumes, which allows security products to add detection very quickly. Making each sample unique by changing a small amount in each file increases the likelihood that some checksum-based protection solutions will fail to detect all of the samples.

Protection

Sophos protects against CTB-Locker at execution with HPmal/Ransom-N, and statically with an array of detection names including: Troj/Ransom-AKW, Troj/Onion-D, Troj/Filecode-B, Troj/HkMain-CT.

Sophos detects the Dalexis/Elenoocka downloader with an array of detection names including: Troj/Agent-AMTG, Troj/Agent-AMKP, Troj/Cabby-H, Troj/Agent-AIRO, Troj/Agent-AMNK, Troj/Agent-AMNP, Troj/Agent-AMOA, Mal/Cabby-B.

These HIPS signatures often don’t require any updates as they detect on the unpacked memory code irrespective of files on disk that are either packed, obfuscated or encrypted.

Having Sophos HIPS technology enabled is strongly recommended to block ransomware proactively.

If you suspect you’ve been compromised by ransomware, you can remove the malware using our Free Virus Removal Tool. Sadly, there’s not much you can do to get your files back except to pay the ransom – the encryption is too strong to crack.

Apart from having your antivirus up to date, there are additional system changes to help prevent or disarm ransomware infections that a user can apply.

1. Back up your files.

The best way to ensure you do not lose your files to ransomware is to back them up regularly. Storing your backup separately is also key – as discussed, some ransomware variants delete Windows shadow copies of files as a further tactic to prevent your recovery, so you need to store your backup offline.

2. Apply windows and other software updates regularly.

Keep your system and applications up to date. This gives you the best chance to avoid your system being exploited using drive-by download attacks and software (particularly Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, Web Browser, etc.) vulnerabilities which are known for installing ransomware.

3. Avoid clicking untrusted email links or opening unsolicited email attachments.

Most ransomware arrives via spam email either by clicking the links or as attachments. Having a good email anti-virus scanner would also proactively block compromised or malicious website links or binary attachments that lead to ransomware.

4. Disable ActiveX content in Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, etc.

We’ve seen many malicious documents that contain macros which can further download ransomware silently in the background.

5. Install a firewall, block Tor and I2P, and restrict to specific ports.

Preventing the malware from reaching its call-home server via the network can disarm an active ransomware variant. As such, blocking connections to I2P or Tor servers via a firewall is an effective measure.

6. Disable remote desktop connections.

Disable remote desktop connections if they are not required in your environment, so that malicious authors cannot access your machine remotely.

7. Block binaries running from %APPDATA% and %TEMP% paths.

Most of the ransomware files are dropped and executed from these locations, so blocking execution would prevent the ransomware from running."
5		After Nike's Outstanding Quarter, Here's The Bad News (NYSE:NKE)	[]	"It seems that nothing can stop Nike (NYSE:NKE). The apparel giant reported another outstanding quarter on Friday, and the stock rose 8% in early trading. This sent NKE to yet another all-time high of $125 per share.

Nike has truly had an incredible run. The stock is up 30% just since the beginning of the year while the S&P 500 is actually down 5% in that time. Nike's chart is truly something to behold.

But before investors rush to buy the stock, a word of caution is warranted: Nike is expensive. In fact, the company is more expensive than it's been in the past decade. Not since the 1999-2000 tech bubble, when many stocks experienced wildly distorted valuations, has Nike been so richly valued. That is what worries me about NKE, and why I can't recommend investors buy the stock at its current levels.

Nothing Wrong With Nike As A Business

To be sure, Nike deserves a lot of credit. The company managed to beat analyst estimates, and grew both revenue and earnings in a tough climate. There seem to be little that can hold Nike back from growth. Strong U.S. dollar? No problem. Economic slowdown in China? No problem. Nike generates growth anyway.

It reported 5% revenue growth last quarter, year over year, along with 23% earnings growth, thanks to rising revenue and margin expansion. Excluding the effects of currency fluctuations, the results were even better. Currency-neutral revenue would have grown 14%, which is outstanding. Other key metrics look good as well. World-wide futures orders, a gauge of future demand, were up 9%, or 17% excluding foreign exchange. This successful quarter came on top of a very good fiscal 2015. Last fiscal year, Nike grew revenue 10% to $30 billion. Earnings per share soared 25% last fiscal year.

Valuation Is The Bad News

As the following chart shows, Nike's huge stock price rally in the past several years has mostly been due to multiple expansion. This casts Nike's tremendous decade-long rally into a different light.

Investors are clearly getting more and more enthusiastic about Nike with each passing quarter. Investors have bid the stock up to 31 times earnings, a very high multiple for this company. Its average P/E over the past five years is 23 times. That means NKE is currently valued 35% above its five-year average. And, the company is valued at 26 times forward earnings, which is again well above average. Nike looks expensive across any number of common valuation metrics. It trades for more than 7 times book value, and 19 times enterprise value to EBITDA.

With a valuation profile like this, there simply are not enough margins of safety built in to protect investors against whatever possibility, albeit low, that Nike's future results may not live up to expectations. The company does not offer much of a dividend (it currently yields less than 1%), so investors aren't getting a dividend margin of safety either.

Sooner or later, all companies, even the former high-flyers, encounter a speed bump in the road. Having at least one margin of safety in your pocket (value, income, or ideally both) is a great way for investors to protect themselves against unforeseen risk.

Nike: Wait For A Pullback

There is no doubt that Nike is a great business, and is one of the world's strongest brands. On the other hand, it's also true that even a great company like Nike can deliver sub-par returns to investors, if too high a price is paid. The company is doing an admirable job of growing and improving its fundamentals in a tough climate. When reading through Nike's earnings materials, it's almost nothing but good news.

The bad news has nothing to do with Nike as a company, it has to do with Nike as a stock. To me, NKE falls into the ""great company, bad stock"" camp. As much as I like Nike as a business, I can't look past the valuation. Ignoring valuation can be a dangerous game that I do not want to play. While I congratulate investors who have held Nike for any length of time, who are sitting on some huge gains, I can't recommend new investors buy the stock today at these levels.

6	2015-12-31	How To Stem The Global Shortage Of Data Scientists – TechCrunch	['Henry Pickavet', 'Amy Gershkoff', 'Amy Gershkoff Is The Chief Data Officer At Zynga', 'An Adjunct Professor At The University Of California', 'Berkeley', 'Where She Teaches Data Science.']	"Data scientist might be considered the “sexiest job of the 21st century,” with many companies eager to hire data science talent. But 20 years ago the term was barely used, save for a few academic articles.

Even a decade ago, explaining data science to employers was challenging. Few people understood the value of a skill set that combines computer science, statistics, operations research, engineering, business insights and strategy — and the impact it can have on a business.

But things have changed over the last five years. Not only has the term “data science” become commonplace, but data scientists have become highly sought after in the marketplace and lauded in the press.

After all, it was data science that gave consumers personalized shopping recommendations on websites like eBay and Amazon, customized entertainment recommendations on Netflix and Spotify and tailored content and advertising on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest — all at tens of millions of dollars (if not more) of revenue upside for these businesses.

Over time, organizations started to see the value of data science as the volume of data they had to analyze increased dramatically. For instance, today an estimated 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created daily. Within this voluminous quantity of data lie insights that could enable companies to gain a competitive edge and provide a better consumer experience, which is why many organizations have now made data science a top priority.

In a KPMG survey of C-suite executives, 99 percent said that analysis of big data was important to their strategy for next year. As the study stated, “Today, the issue is no longer about owning the most data but rather … how to turn data into insights.”

Which is where data scientists come in. The role of a data scientist is to mine enormous volumes of data and pull out key insights. In an era where enterprise-generated data is expected to exceed 240 exabytes daily by 2020, the need for experts trained in extracting insights from data is more important than ever.

So what’s the problem? We have a global talent shortage, and the demand for data scientists continues to grow rapidly, far outpacing the anemic growth in supply. A McKinsey study predicts that by 2018 the number of data science jobs in the United States alone will exceed 490,000, but there will be fewer than 200,000 available data scientists to fill these positions. Globally, demand for data scientists is projected to exceed supply by more than 50 percent by 2018.

The need for experts trained in extracting insights from data is more important than ever.

The global talent drought may be partially caused by the dearth of universities that offer data science programs dedicated to preparing the next generation of data scientists. Fewer than one-third of U.S. News & World Report’s Top 100 Global Universities offer degrees in data science. Of the 29 universities that offer data science programs, a mere six make them available to undergraduates (the rest are reserved for graduate students).

Moreover, the average cohort size for one of these data science programs is just 23 students. The small cohort size may be partially attributed to the fact that most of these data science programs tend to be offered to graduate students, and sizes of graduate programs tend to be smaller. Still, at 23 students per cohort, we are unlikely to make a meaningful dent in closing the global data science talent gap.

An analysis of the curricula for these data science programs also suggests cause for concern. Most are focused almost exclusively on the computer engineering aspects of data science, with course titles such as Software Design, Parallel Computing and Software Development.

Largely missing from the data science curricula at many of these universities are courses in statistical analysis, insights and strategy. This oversight may have serious consequences for graduating students and their future employers.

Without training in these other areas, data scientists may be capable of designing an algorithm that is mathematically elegant, but doesn’t make strategic sense for the business. They also may not know how to design an experiment to determine whether the algorithm is effective. In other words, computer science skills alone are insufficient for success as a data scientist in today’s marketplace.

Furthermore, many data science programs lack courses that help students apply their technical data science skills to fields such as marketing, operations, product development and supply chain, and industries such as energy, bioinformatics, transportation and healthcare.

While there are some universities that have distinguished themselves for having curricula that focus on the multi-faceted aspects of data science, such as New York University, there are still far too few universities producing enough graduates to meet today’s growing demand for data scientists.

There are three steps we can take to help stem this talent shortage:

Increase the number of universities offering data science degrees: To accelerate this, employers can partner with universities to help design and fund the creation of these programs. Accenture’s recent partnership with the University of California, Berkeley to create a new Big Data and Data Science curriculum is one such example. As part of the partnership, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business collaborated with Accenture to create new classes and a lecture series to equip MBA students with the skills needed to analyze big data, including a new course on data analytics.

Offer data science programs for undergraduates: Enrollment in data science programs must radically increase — cohort sizes of 23 students simply will not close the talent gap fast enough. Offering data science degree programs to undergraduates as well as graduate students can significantly expand enrollment. Universities also should consider offering courses online and during evenings and weekends in an effort to reach non-traditional students.

Launch programs that train analysts to become data scientists: Many organizations are flush with analysts who typically have some data science skills in key areas such as statistics. Zynga, for example, recently started a Data Science Transition Program, which enables high-performing analysts to be apprenticed to a data scientist for twelve months, during which time they learn data science skills on the job while taking online data science courses. At the end of the program, the participant becomes an Associate Data Scientist at the company.

Closing the global data science talent gap won’t be easy, but it’s critical to ensure companies have the ability to make data-driven strategic decisions. If companies and universities work together to address the problem, we can better prepare both students and employers for success."

Barclays may have shelled out

According to a regulatory filing, Barclays' CEO Antony Jenkins, as well as the head of the investment bank Tom King, group finance director Tushar Morzaria, and 8 other executives received £16.5 million in share awards.

The Barclays stock was priced at £2.535 per share and the place of trading was the London Stock Exchange.

King received the biggest payout in shares with stock worth £4.7 million while the bank's CEO Jenkins got £4.3 million in share awards.

While the executives received half the amount of share awards, when compared to 2014's £32 million total, the amount is bound to irk the the leading pension body Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF).

LAPFF called for Sir John Sunderland, the chair of Barclays' pay review committee, to resign for ""misleading shareholders"" over its pay policy.

Barclays confirmed in its 2014 results statement that it its pretax profit tanked by 21% to £2.26bn.

Overall, for Barclays staff, the 2014 bonus pot for the bank fell by £520 million to £1.86bn."
