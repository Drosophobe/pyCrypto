In 2022, these stock indexes moved from a weak positive correlation to bitcoin into the positive strongly correlated band (>0.7). While not as potentially impressive as a strong negative correlation would imply, bitcoin’s return profile still resembles a macro asset we haven’t quite seen before. Just a year ago the S&P 500 and bitcoin’s correlation coefficient was negative and close to zero. Correlation moving from near-zero to strong in a year is remarkable. On top of that, this correlation was strongly negative back in 2019.\n",

      "Text: What is a cryptocurrency? Ever received a paper token from your next-door paan shop in lieu of a small change, which he would accept the next time you visit him? Imagine that token digitally, and that's your cryptocurrency. The big difference is, here there is no owner-issuer and it would, at least in theory, be accepted globally. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual coin secured by cryptography, which makes it next to impossible to counterfeit. They have their own store values, and are designed to use as a medium of exchange for buying goods or services. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised, meaning that no authority regulates them. They are built on the blockchain network technology, which ensures transparency and helps track every transaction. Such currencies, theoretically, are immune to government interference or any kind of manipulation. Because cryptocurrencies do not have an underlying economic base, they are inflation-proof. Plus, the digital structure facilitates free portability across geographical borders, divisibility and transparency. However, they are often criticised for the possibility of misuse in illegal activities, exchange rate volatility and the vulnerability of the infrastructure underlying them.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do cryptocurrencies work? Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. They are tokens that can be used as a form of payment in exchange for online goods and services. They carry a pre-determined store value of their own, just like any other fiat currency like the US dollar or the Indian rupee. Cryptocurrencies are digitally mined, where very sophisticated computers solve extremely complex computational mathematics problems. Their mining is painstaking, costly and only sporadically rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is blockchain technology? Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing the risk and cutting costs for all involved. Unlike a typical digital database, blockchain stores data in blocks that are then chained together. As new data comes in, it is entered in a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained to the previous block, which then chains the data in a chronological order. Blockchain’s most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. In the case of cryptocurrencies, blockchain is used in a decentralised way so that no single person or group has control over it and, instead, all users can retain control collectively. Decentralised blockchains are immutable, which means data once entered is irreversible. In the case of cryptocurrencies, this means transactions are recorded permanently and can be viewed by anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to invest in cryptocurrency? It’s not a very difficult task to invest in cryptocurrency, thanks to the easy access available to crypto exchanges and deep penetration of the internet and smartphones. Technology has eased the access to digital currencies for potential investors. To invest in cryptocurrencies, investors need to first do some homework for choosing the right cryptocurrency and crypto exchange. One can buy these currencies using their home currencies, or US dollars, from his/her preferred exchange. However, there are some currencies that accept investment only in Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the key steps to buy cryptocurrency? It is pretty easy actually. The entire process involves five key steps. They are: a) Choose a crypto exchange; b) Create your account and verify it; c) Deposit the fund and start investing; d) Place you order to buy desired cryptocurrency, e) Select a storage method. However, there are also other ways to invest in cryptocurrencies. These include crypto ETFs (similar to those of gold and other ETFs) or investing in cryptocurrency-related stocks. These options are not so mainstream yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the minimum amount you can invest in cryptocurrencies? There is no defined limit to invest in cryptocurrencies, just like there is no minimum limit to invest in stocks. However, there is some difference. If you do not wish to buy an entire cryptocurrency, you are allowed to buy small units of it. Once registered, a user can add money to his/her wallet and use that amount to place an order for\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you invest Indian rupee in crypto? Yes, you can invest in cryptocurrencies using Indian currency, but you cannot use cash for the payment. Every investor needs a bank account linked to the crypto account to add money and make a digital payment. Only KYC-approved users can make such payments. Investors should note that exchanges charge some fees when you make an investment and redeem it. The fee levied may vary from one exchange to another, and from one currency to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can cryptocurrencies be used to make online purchases? Yes, cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange, which can be used to make payments for online purchases. There are hundreds of online shops and retailers that accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, there is a catch. Both the buyer and seller should agree to accept the particular cryptocurrency for the deal. There are various search engines to find the goods and services that can be purchased using cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should you invest in cryptocurrency? If an investor believes in the technology-backed digital currency, then cryptocurrency should be his cup of tea. Just a decade-old asset class, it has yielded astronomical returns over the years. Some investors look to use these digitally coded tokens to hedge against inflation. Despite high volatility and speculations, there are multiple reasons that they can become mainstream in the coming future.\n",

      "Text: You've likely heard some of the following terms if you've paid attention to the world of finance: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. But what do they mean? And why is cryptocurrency suddenly so hot?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we'll explain the blockchain basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "As society become increasingly digital, financial services providers are looking to offer customers the same services to which they're accustomed, but in a more efficient, secure, and cost effective way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter blockchain technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The origins of blockchain are a bit nebulous. A person or group of people known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto invented and released the tech in 2009 as a way to digitally and anonymously send payments between two parties without needing a third party to verify the transaction. It was initially designed to facilitate, authorize, and log the transfer of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. (read more)\n",
      "\n",
      "How does blockchain technology work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain tech is actually rather easy to understand at its core. Essentially, it's a shared database populated with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. Think of it as a kind of highly encrypted and verified shared Google Document, in which each entry in the sheet depends on a logical relationship to all its predecessors. Blockchain tech offers a way to securely and efficiently create a tamper-proof log of sensitive activity (anything from international money transfers to shareholder records).\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain's conceptual framework and underlying code is useful for a variety of financial processes because of the potential it has to give companies a secure, digital alternative to banking processes that are typically bureaucratic, time-consuming, paper-heavy, and expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are cryptocurrencies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies are essentially just digital money, digital tools of exchange that use cryptography and the aforementioned blockchain technology to facilitate secure and anonymous transactions. There had been several iterations of cryptocurrency over the years, but Bitcoin truly thrust cryptocurrencies forward in the late 2000s. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies floating out on the market now, but Bitcoin is far and away the most popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you mine cryptocurrency?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies don't just fall out of the sky. Like any other form of money, it takes work to produce them. And that work comes in the form of mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's take a step back. Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, ensured that there would ever only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. He (or they) reached that figure by calculating that people would discover, or \"mine,\" a certain number of blocks of transactions each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every four years, the number of Bitcoins released in relation to the previous cycle gets reduced by 50%, along with the reward to miners for discovering new blocks. At the moment, that reward is 12.5 Bitcoins. Therefore, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation will approach 21 million but never actually reach that figure. This means Bitcoin will never experience inflation. The downside here is that a hack or cyberattack could be a disaster because it could erase Bitcoin wallets with little hope of getting the value back.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for mining Bitcoins, the process requires electrical energy. Miners solve complex mathematical problems, and the reward is more Bitcoins generated and awarded to them. Miners also verify transactions and prevent fraud, so more miners equals faster, more reliable, and more secure transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto's designs, Bitcoin mining becomes more difficult as more miners join the fray. In 2009, a miner could mine 200 Bitcoin in a matter of days. In 2014, it would take approximately 98 years to mine just one, according to 99Bitcoins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Super powerful computers called Application Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, were developed specifically to mine Bitcoins. But because so many miners have joined in the last few years, it remains difficult to mine loads. The solution is mining pools, groups of miners who band together and are paid relative to their share of the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current & future uses of blockchain technology & cryptocurrency\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its inception, Bitcoin has been rather volatile. But based on its recent boom — and a forecast by Snapchat's first investor, Jeremy Liew, that it would hit $500,000 by 2030 — and the prospect of grabbing a slice of the Bitcoin pie becomes far more attractive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin users expect 94% of all bitcoins to be released by 2024. As the number moves toward the ceiling of 21 million, many expect the profits miners once made from the creation of new blocks to become so low that they will become negligible. But as more bitcoins enter circulation, transaction fees could rise and offset this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for blockchain technology itself, it has numerous applications, from banking to the Internet of Things. It is expected that companies will flesh out their blockchain IoT solutions. Blockchain is a promising tool that will transform parts of the IoT and enable solutions that provide greater insight into assets, operations, and supply chains. It will also transform how health records and connected medical devices store and transmit data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain won’t be usable everywhere, but in many cases, it will be a part of the solution that makes the best use of the tools in the IoT arsenal. Blockchain can help to address particular problems, improve workflows, and reduce costs, which are the ultimate goals of any IoT project.\n",

      "It’s been a tumultuous year for investors, but it’s been even more so for those with a stake in crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, Bitcoin’s price has dropped by nearly 50% since its all-time high of $68,000 in November. Ethereum has followed bitcoin’s lead and so has just about every other cryptocurrency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crypto market, which has been tracking with the stock markets lately, has been a casualty of the broader market selloff of risky assets as investors wrestle with high inflation, the war in Ukraine, and shifts in U.S. monetary policy. Although not usually correlated to stocks, the crypto and stock markets are rising and falling in similar patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "June, in particular, was a whirlwind month for the crypto industry. Several crypto companies announced layoffs and froze withdrawals due to extreme market conditions. Some have even filed for bankruptcy to stem losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "And some experts are warning the worst may be yet to come — and bitcoin’s price, as well as other cryptocurrencies, could drop even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes bear markets can last up to several months,” Charlene Fadirepo, a crypto expert and founder of Guidefi, recently told NextAdvisor during an Instagram Live. “Some people track the 20-week average for bitcoin, and according to that, that gets us in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. I don’t know where it’s going to go, but based on past trends, we’ve been in that range.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest crypto market crash is just a reminder for investors that crypto assets come with extra risk and volatility, especially in times of economic and political uncertainty like we’re in now. Either way, experts advise not to make financial decisions based on news-related panic or hype. Here’s what investors should make of the latest crypto news:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla revealed on Thursday during its second-quarter earnings call that it sold 75% of its bitcoin holdings between April and June. While the company still holds $218 million worth of digital assets, the move added $936 million in cash to its balance sheet. During Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, CEO Elon Musk addressed the crypto sell-off, saying that it “should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin.” Musk said Tesla sold its Bitcoin because it was “concerned about overall liquidity of the company given COVID-19 shutdowns in China.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Crypto exchange Blockchain.com announced Thursday it’s laying off of 25% of its staff, citing financial losses it has incurred during the crypto bear market. The percentage represents about 150 employees around the world. The firm said it’s in the process of closing down its office in Argentina and will avoid further expansions into other countries until further notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "More crypto lenders and exchange platforms are pausing withdrawals in the wake of the crypto market crash in recent weeks. Zipmex became the latest crypto-industry casualty, suspending withdrawals on its exchange platform this week due to “volatile market conditions.” Crypto lender Vauld recently announced it is suspending withdrawals on its platform, and crypto lending firm Nexo is now exploring a Vauld acquisition. Babel Finance is another crypto lender that recently froze withdrawals, saying in a statement that it is facing “unusual liquidity pressures” because of the crypto market’s fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and a good indicator of the crypto market in general, since other coins like Ethereum (and smaller altcoins) tend to follow its trends. Even though Bitcoin recently set another new all-time high, it was a pretty normal uptick for the crypto, which is notorious for its volatility. That’s not to say investors should take swings in either direction lightly, and this is also why investing experts recommend not making any major investment changes based on these normal fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptocurrency is still very new, and everything from innovation to regulation can have an outsize impact for investors. Here’s how you can invest smartly, regardless of what’s making news or Bitcoin’s price swings.\n",
      "\n",
      "What You Should Know About Crypto Investing Cryptocurrency is a highly volatile, speculative investment. Only invest in crypto what you’re prepared to lose, and make sure you have other financial priorities in place first: save money in an emergency fund, contribute to retirement savings, and pay off any high-interest debt balances.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Investors Should Deal With Volatility\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptocurrency volatility is nothing new, and you should be comfortable with this if you decide to invest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volatility can be attributed to an “immature market,” says Ollie Leech, learn editor at Coindesk, a cryptocurrency news outlet. Anything from a celebrity tweet to new federal regulation can send prices spiraling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Elon Musk puts hashtag bitcoin in his Twitter bio, it sends Bitcoin up 10%,” says Leech.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unpredictability is part of the reason why investing experts warn against investing huge amounts of your portfolio into a risky asset like crypto. Many recommend keeping your crypto holdings to less than 5% of your total portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "For new investors, day-to-day swings can seem frightening. But if you’ve invested with a buy-and-hold strategy, dips are nothing to panic about, says Humphrey Yang the personal finance expert behind Humphrey Talks. Yang recommends a simple solution: don’t look at your investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t check on it. That’s the best thing you can do. If you let your emotions get too much into it then you might sell at the wrong time, make the wrong decision,” says Yang.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the traditional “set it and forget it” advice that many traditional long-term investors follow. If you can’t get on board, and the extreme dips continue to cause you worry, then you might have too much riding on your cryptocurrency investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The most important thing any investor can do, whether they are investing in bitcoin or stocks, is not just to have a plan in place, but to also have a plan they can stick with,” says Douglas Boneparth, a CFP and the president of Bone Fide Wealth. “While buying the dip might be attractive, especially with an asset that you really like, it might not always be the best idea at the moment.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The bullish sentiment was helped by a rally in stock markets in Europe and Asia. U.S. stock futures were also higher. Cryptocurrencies, in particularly bitcoin, has been closely correlated with equity market trade. Often, a rise in stocks will also lift sentiment in the crypto market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other cryptocurrencies also bounced, with ether up 8.94% at $1,466 by the end of the day Monday.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bitcoin bounced above $22,000 on Monday, hitting its highest level in more than a month as the cryptocurrency market held out hope that the contagion and shakeout over the past few weeks is nearing its end.\n",
      "\n",
      "But investors are also watching whether the carnage over the last few weeks, which has seen bitcoin near 70% off its all-time high that was hit in November and billions of dollars wiped off the market, might be over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price crash has brought the downfall of several high-profile companies in the space, most notably hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto lender Celsius, both of which have filed for bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These collapses have caused contagion across the industry and seen other associated companies come under pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of this has been caused by the huge amounts of leverage and borrowing that has taken place in this latest crypto cycle. Three Arrows Capital for example took out loans it was unable to pay back once the crypto collapse took place. Celsius, which offered customers yields over 18% for depositing their digital coins, took on high risk trading activities to earn the interest to try to give back to its users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crypto companies have been selling off whatever assets they have to try to meet their liabilities which has put pressure on the broader market.\n",

      "\"The worst of market contagion has likely run its course, with the majority of forced selling behind us,\" David Moreno, research analyst at CryptoCompare, wrote in a research note.\n",

      "Despite the rally, the crypto market is still suffering. Both bitcoin and ether are down more than 50% this year. Bitcoin had its worst quarter in more than a decade in the second quarter.\n",

      "It’s a stark reversal from last week, when Ethereum was the largest gainer among top coins, apparently due in part to increasing certainty over the timing of the “merge,” an upgrade that is expected to reduce transaction costs for network users and potentially decrease the available supply of ETH.\n",
