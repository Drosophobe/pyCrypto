      "Text: You've likely heard some of the following terms if you've paid attention to the world of finance: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. But what do they mean? And why is cryptocurrency suddenly so hot?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we'll explain the blockchain basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "As society become increasingly digital, financial services providers are looking to offer customers the same services to which they're accustomed, but in a more efficient, secure, and cost effective way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter blockchain technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The origins of blockchain are a bit nebulous. A person or group of people known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto invented and released the tech in 2009 as a way to digitally and anonymously send payments between two parties without needing a third party to verify the transaction. It was initially designed to facilitate, authorize, and log the transfer of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. (read more)\n",
      "\n",
      "How does blockchain technology work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain tech is actually rather easy to understand at its core. Essentially, it's a shared database populated with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. Think of it as a kind of highly encrypted and verified shared Google Document, in which each entry in the sheet depends on a logical relationship to all its predecessors. Blockchain tech offers a way to securely and efficiently create a tamper-proof log of sensitive activity (anything from international money transfers to shareholder records).\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain's conceptual framework and underlying code is useful for a variety of financial processes because of the potential it has to give companies a secure, digital alternative to banking processes that are typically bureaucratic, time-consuming, paper-heavy, and expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are cryptocurrencies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies are essentially just digital money, digital tools of exchange that use cryptography and the aforementioned blockchain technology to facilitate secure and anonymous transactions. There had been several iterations of cryptocurrency over the years, but Bitcoin truly thrust cryptocurrencies forward in the late 2000s. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies floating out on the market now, but Bitcoin is far and away the most popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you mine cryptocurrency?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies don't just fall out of the sky. Like any other form of money, it takes work to produce them. And that work comes in the form of mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's take a step back. Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, ensured that there would ever only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. He (or they) reached that figure by calculating that people would discover, or \"mine,\" a certain number of blocks of transactions each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every four years, the number of Bitcoins released in relation to the previous cycle gets reduced by 50%, along with the reward to miners for discovering new blocks. At the moment, that reward is 12.5 Bitcoins. Therefore, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation will approach 21 million but never actually reach that figure. This means Bitcoin will never experience inflation. The downside here is that a hack or cyberattack could be a disaster because it could erase Bitcoin wallets with little hope of getting the value back.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for mining Bitcoins, the process requires electrical energy. Miners solve complex mathematical problems, and the reward is more Bitcoins generated and awarded to them. Miners also verify transactions and prevent fraud, so more miners equals faster, more reliable, and more secure transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto's designs, Bitcoin mining becomes more difficult as more miners join the fray. In 2009, a miner could mine 200 Bitcoin in a matter of days. In 2014, it would take approximately 98 years to mine just one, according to 99Bitcoins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Super powerful computers called Application Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, were developed specifically to mine Bitcoins. But because so many miners have joined in the last few years, it remains difficult to mine loads. The solution is mining pools, groups of miners who band together and are paid relative to their share of the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current & future uses of blockchain technology & cryptocurrency\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its inception, Bitcoin has been rather volatile. But based on its recent boom — and a forecast by Snapchat's first investor, Jeremy Liew, that it would hit $500,000 by 2030 — and the prospect of grabbing a slice of the Bitcoin pie becomes far more attractive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin users expect 94% of all bitcoins to be released by 2024. As the number moves toward the ceiling of 21 million, many expect the profits miners once made from the creation of new blocks to become so low that they will become negligible. But as more bitcoins enter circulation, transaction fees could rise and offset this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for blockchain technology itself, it has numerous applications, from banking to the Internet of Things. It is expected that companies will flesh out their blockchain IoT solutions. Blockchain is a promising tool that will transform parts of the IoT and enable solutions that provide greater insight into assets, operations, and supply chains. It will also transform how health records and connected medical devices store and transmit data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchain won’t be usable everywhere, but in many cases, it will be a part of the solution that makes the best use of the tools in the IoT arsenal. Blockchain can help to address particular problems, improve workflows, and reduce costs, which are the ultimate goals of any IoT project.\n",

      "This week has not been too bright for the price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, as the markets turned red. The price of Bitcoin started falling from around $7,600 to a low of just over $6,500 at press time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this fall is not as dramatic as some others in the history of the volatile cryptocurrency, the general sentiment around the market has been negative for most of 2018. Still, Bitcoin is a volatile asset with its ups and downs still coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the most recent slump that began on June 10, to a reprieve at the announcement that the SEC won’t consider Ethereum a security, the markets continue to go down, as well as up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Coin360.io\n",
      "\n",
      "It has led many investors and interested parties to question what is going on in the market, especially in comparison to the highs of December last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few experts in the field of cryptocurrency, investing, and markets spoke to Cointelegraph to give their insight into the current market situation, and why it is dropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naeem Aslam, Emin Gün Sirer, Tom Lee, Miguel Palencia, and Alistair Milne, all discuss their thoughts as to the market is falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naeem Aslam’s concerns with security and regulation\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 11, it was reported that a small cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea was hacked and many mainstream media outlets tied this catalyst as a reason for the sudden downturn in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, many commentators have refuted this cause-and-effect link and have sought other reasons for why the price is down. However, regardless of how much effect the hack directly had on the price in Bitcoin, Naeem Aslam, Chief Market Analyst at ThinkMarkets, discusses how this latest hack is another instance of negative press for the cryptocurrency space.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exchanges are not utilising the top-notch technology to protect consumers and hackers are taking full advantage of this issue. The question is, is there any limit to these hacks? After every few months, we are seeing the same pattern emerging. This is the result of loose regulatory control and regulators must step in to protect the consumers. Anyone who wants to do with anything with exchanges should be forced to adopt high-grade security and regular security upgrades.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of these hacks adds a far bigger element of risk to investing in cryptocurrencies, and for the new market of traditional investors, and this is a big turn off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Traditional investors would look for riskier assets when the bull market is in full throttle and investors run for the hills when bears are in town. However, smart investors use a slightly different approach. They move their funds from riskier assets to those where they can seek safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For instance, in a bull market, sectors such as financial, tech and energy are the most favorite sectors. When the market starts to fall off the cliff, portfolio managers and hedge funds start to favour sectors such as consumer staples. They seek stocks with better dividend yield because, even though the general trend in the market could be to the downside, they still get a better yield relative to the overall market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emin Gün Sirer looks at a crackdown on manipulation\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the bigger news stories to come out this week, that has also been tied to the downturn of the market is that research indicates Tether and Bitfinex were at the center of price manipulation, which led to December’s high of nearly $20,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emin Gün Sirer, associate professor at Cornell University, looks not only at this news, but also at the fact that there is a law enforcement crackdown coming on price manipulators as a reason as to why the market is down. He also explains how the cryptocurrency market has not decoupled yet, which only adds to a bigger sentiment of negativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The cryptocurrency markets are in their early stages. We know this from the fact that the coins still have not decoupled — they all move in unison, regardless of the merits of one project over another. This indicates that systemic risks to the area dominate all other concerns,” he told Cointelegraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The current downturn is motivated by one such perceived risk: the law enforcement action on exchanges and their effort to put a stop to price manipulation. This was a long time in the making, and cannot happen soon enough. I suspect that the law enforcement action will be modest in scope and will bring much needed clarity and positivity to markets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While this investigation into price manipulation may be having a negative effect on Bitcoin’s current price, it can only be viewed as positive. And for Gün Sirer, it cannot happen soon enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fact is that these technologies are poised to transform the way we do business. They should not need market manipulation to sustain their value. I'm looking forward to a decoupled world where markets are able to evaluate each coin on its own merits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Three reasons from Tom Lee, plus futures effects\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Lee, the co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who is renowned for his bullish predictions on the Bitcoin price, has given Cointelegraph three reasons why the Bitcoin market is diving, and also mentioned his feeling on futures markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think there are several factors why cryptos are falling. One, we had a parabolic move at the end of last year, so there is a period of consolidation and price adjustment that is taking place.” “I also think bigger factors this year have been a lot of government actions that have been taken this year that have scared crypto investors, probably the most notable is the actions taken by the US regulators, like the SEC taking action against ICOs.” “Lastly, the pace of institutional investor participation in this space has been taking longer than expected, and I think part of that has to do with the slowness of getting some of the onramps established.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee also told Bloomberg that he feels that the expiration of Bitcoin futures contracts has a part to play in the most recent decline in Bitcoin price. He explains this further to Cointelegraph by saying that these volatile movements from futures will not persist indefinitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Futures markets, in normal liquid markets where there is broad participation, don't have an effect on the underlie, the futures itself is adding liquidity, or attracting liquidity, because institutions can use it,” Lee explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In crypto right now, the market has a supply/demand problem, because mining rewards, coupled with tax selling, and other factors have caused more supply versus demand for crypto. The futures markets have been subject to some potential manipulation. I don’t think it will be the case in a few years from now, but even though the futures markets at the moment are only a hundred-million or so contracts, it is enough to affect Bitcoin price.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miguel Palencia’s position on ‘whales’\n",
      "\n",
      "For Miguel Palencia, chief information officer at Qtum, which currently ranked 20th in terms of market cap, this current low has a lot to do with the faux-decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies which are still expanding and distributing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He talked to Cointelegraph of the effect that ‘whales’ are having on moving the price around, but also makes mention of how these types of players in a relatively small and new market are also helping the ecosystem stay alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bitcoin, like other assets and technologies, goes through cycles that affect its use, which is often correlated with the asset price. What we see here, is that the cycle was accelerated by situations which can be solved by fully decentralized operations. Eventually, when the blockchain ecosystem becomes fully decentralized and not controlled by big stakeholders and \"whales,\" it will be bringing back trust into the markets and we can see the markets climbing again, on the other hand, these market movers and shakers, supported by true Bitcoin believers, will not let Bitcoin reach zero.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a double-edged sword then, according to Palencia. Whales must surely have a part to play in the supposed market manipulation, but they are also a driving force in keeping the market afloat with their own investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alistair Milne’s view on the rapid slowdown\n",
      "\n",
      "Alistair Milne, CIO of Altana Digital Currency Fund and founder of Cointrader, is examining the entire year’s performance and putting that December rally into perspective. The markets may well be down compared to the highs of $20,000, but $6,000 or $7,000 per BTC is still pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a combination of a rapid slowdown in adoption, user-growth and profit-taking, as well as hedging,” Milne told Cointelegraph, explaining why he believes the market is where it is currently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Altcoins particularly became very over-valued and were overdue a correction. We are now searching for equilibrium again, where demand meets supply. From a macro point of view, it has never been better, so I feel comparisons to 2014/15 are misplaced.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While many are hoping the bottom has been reached and the downturn is ending, Milne still thinks it is coming, but that it will provide a much more stable base to rebuild upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think after we eventually bottom, it will be a far more gradual comeback for the price likely accelerating in 2019.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No need to panic\n",
      "\n",
      "The sentiment around the markets may be negative and one for concern when it comes to everyday investors, but overall, the experts spoken to do not seem to be raising any cause for alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gün Sirer is calling for more regulation and policing to try and stamp out the perceived market manipulation, and Palencia raises a good point about the need for whales at the moment, but in the future, true decentralization will be reached and Bitcoin will be stronger for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milne is also looking ahead, not worried about a bottom still-to-be reached, as it would allow for Bitcoin to gradually come back stronger. Aslam also brings up an important aspect that needs to be sorted out, that of hacks and poor security which are affecting market confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a lot that needs to be patched up in the cryptocurrency market, and when these things are sorted out, the price should follow in repairing itself to a more pleasant level.\n",

      "Text: There is a bloodbath in cryptocurrency markets on fears of a crackdown by governments across the world. Apart from Tether (which has parity with the U.S. dollar), all other cryptocurrencies were in the red and had shed values in double-digits. At 14:19 UTC, the overall market valuation for cryptocurrencies tumbled to $566.2 billion, down by 20% from its value 24 hours ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point last morning, it crashed to $536.5 billion, down by 30% from its price 24 hours earlier. The price of a single bitcoin was $11,825.70, a decline of 17.27% from its price 24 hours ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stellar and Ripple were the biggest losers among the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies, as of this writing, down by 26.19% and 25.18%, respectively. The overall declines are not uniform as the chart below shows. Even with today's declines, three cryptocurrencies are still trading positive to their valuations last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government Crackdown Spurs Declines\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of a crackdown by governments in China and South Korea, among the largest trading venues for cryptocurrencies, is being cited as the primary reason for declines in prices. South Korea had threatened to ban cryptocurrency trading last year but backtracked from its stance on Sunday. Yesterday was another story, however. In a radio interview, the South Korean finance minister said shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges was still an option but that it needed “serious discussion” first.\n",
      "\n",
      "After banning cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017, China is cracking down on other venues for trading of digital currencies. A Bloomberg report quotes unnamed sources as saying “the government plans to block domestic access to homegrown and offshore platforms that enable centralized trading.” But the report does not provide a proper definition or provide examples of such platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Korea is the world’s third-largest trading venue for cryptocurrencies after Japan and the United States. Ripple and Ethereum, the world’s second and third most-traded cryptocurrencies, owe recent spikes in their prices to trading on Bithumb, South Korea’s largest exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerrie Walsh, assistant economist at Capital Economics, told the Wall Street Journal that moves by the governments had “clearly rattled” investors. “The more widespread Bitcoin becomes, the more likely it is that stricter regulations will be enforced,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin Price Manipulation Flashback\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as bitcoin’s price crashes today, perspective is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new paper in the Journal of Monetary Economics sheds light on how two bots, run by a single person, pumped up bitcoin’s price from $150 to $1,000 in two months on Mt. Gox, an exchange that crashed back in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the paper, approximately 600,00 bitcoins valued at $188 million were “fraudulently acquired.” Its authors found that trading volumes spiked when Markus and Willy, the two bots, were in the game. The spike brought in other, human investors resulting in a virtuous cycle that drove up prices through artificial demand. The exchange profited by pocketing the transaction fees. Not surprisingly, the paper’s authors claim that thin markets (or markets without enough liquidity) made manipulation easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar situation exists today. There are 1,385 cryptocurrencies in the market today, and trading volumes, even for the largest cryptocurrencies, are susceptible to sharp spikes and dips. While multiple reasons are put forward as explanations for cryptocurrency price movement, none of the reasons is plausibly consistent. Bitcoin whales and automated bots are still in the game. More investors, especially institutional ones, will bring liquidity to bitcoin markets and stabilize its price. Increased government regulation should also help tamp down the effect of automated trading on bitcoin’s price.\n",

      "Text: This is a common question and an understandable one given that there are more than 2,300 actively traded cryptocurrencies and more than 1,700 that have already been buried in the crypto graveyard. The variety of investment opportunities can result in analysis paralysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should choose projects with history, a clear goal, transparent volume, an active community, and ongoing development. These characteristics indicate a healthy project with potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also important to consider your risk tolerance. You could choose a project that is already listed and actively traded, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Ripple (XRP), or you could go with a high-risk, high-reward ICO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with listed and actively traded cryptocurrencies. These currencies are often regarded as more secure than new projects. They have track records and enough trading volume to be considered liquid. If you choose to invest in a leading coin, follow the news for regulatory developments, policies that may ease or prevent mainstream adoption, and industry shifts. If you have the skills, you can also include technical analysis. That way, you’ll have a well-rounded strategy that minimizes risk. Whether your goal is to HODL for years or to speculate on short-term price fluctuations, established cryptoassets can be an excellent choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are investors who dream of discovering the next Bitcoin or Ethereum. These folks tend to look at pre-ICO projects and ICOs with high growth potential. When considering early-stage opportunities, it’s important to beware projects that promise exorbitant returns. Many projects that make big promises are not really designed to succeed in the real world. They’re solely focused on separating novice investors from their money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever your risk tolerance, before making an investment decision, it is essential to determine which type of cryptoasset you’re considering. There are five main categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "Utility tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "Also known as app tokens, utility tokens have an application and value on their issuing platforms. Investors who purchase utility tokens believe in the project with which they’re associated and want to buy in before the price goes up. Bear in mind that the total supply of utility tokens is usually fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes referred to as “digital shares”, security or equity tokens are tokenized slices of securities in which holders have ownership rights. Security tokens can also provide holders with the right to receive dividends. For more on security tokens, check out our three-part audio documentary, Tokenize the World.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asset tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "Asset tokens are digital representations of physical assets like gold and silver. They’re popular because they provide investors with an easy way to buy precious metals and other commodities. The price of an asset token is tied to the price of an underlying physical asset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currencies\n",
      "\n",
      "Currencies are the most common cryptoasset type. As their name suggests, they serve as a form of payment. Bitcoin (BTC) is the most prominent example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reward tokens\n",
      "\n",
      "Reward tokens have no value on the open market. They’re simply used to gamify platform engagement by rewarding use or loyalty. Most reward tokens can only be spent on their issuing platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve covered the types of tokens a project can issue. Now let’s cover some tips that will make you a better crypto investor. To increase your odds of choosing sound cryptoasset projects, consider each opportunity in terms of the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Philosophy and stated goals\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases, ICOs are ideas that need money to be realized. An ICO is rarely a functioning product. If you decide to invest in an early-stage project, understand that you’re supporting a concept, not something that has been proven. This is not to say that investing in an ICO is foolhardy. In just five days, the EOS (EOS) ICO raised over \\$180 million without a working product. From there, the price of the token skyrocketed more than 450%. What this means is that you should judge an ICO on its fundamentals rather than its track record in the real world. Think about the philosophy on which the project is built as well as its stated goals. Bitcoin was launched as an alternative to traditional money. Ethereum was designed to be a world computer for decentralized applications. The most important factor when selecting a cryptoasset project is the philosophy and stated goals of its founder(s) or team.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal should be ambitious but realistic. The cryptocurrency space is filled with projects that promise to transform the world for the better, but most attempts to reorganize the global financial system or abolish poverty or hunger will fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is vital to distinguish hype from an idea with a real-world use case. Projects that are ambitious in terms of the technology they’re developing or which hope to refine an existing concept have the best chances of disrupting the status quo and meeting with success. That said, it’s worth keeping in mind that the likelihood of finding a unicorn in the crowded cryptocurrency space is not as high as it once was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look for projects that seek to add functionality, accelerate processes, or otherwise address a specific pain point. Cryptoasset projects with clearly defined goals are the most likely to generate long-term value.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also important to consider the technology that powers a project. Launching a token requires a blockchain. Most offerings launch on Ethereum (ETH). Other projects like Cardano (ADA) create a new blockchain from scratch. Starting from square one may yield terrific long-term results, but the process is slow, costly, and difficult to execute.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A whitepaper\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, there are projects in the Cryptosphere that are designed to scam would-be investors out of their money. Those who don’t do their own research risk becoming victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you shy away from established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum and favor projects that fly under the radar, always be sure to read the whitepaper. Serious projects write detailed whitepapers. Tokens with vague whitepapers or whitepapers that have been copied and pasted from other projects should be avoided. A good whitepaper answers all of your questions. It covers the project goal, the founder’s background, the development team, and the roadmap.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good whitepaper also covers the legal framework that exists between the development team and investors. Additionally, it should answer questions related to token distribution such as when and how holders receive tokens and the amount of funding required for each phase of the distribution process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above all, a project’s whitepaper should explain why it needs a token. If that question goes unanswered, stay away. There must be a reason for issuing a token. If the reason isn’t clear, then the project may lack a real-world use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also important to know how raised funds will be stored. If funds are not secured by smart contract or an escrow account, then your money will be at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, it’s wise to familiarize yourself with the company behind the coin. Does the team include experienced software developers? Does the CEO have a track record? Who are the project’s advisors? If the advisory team seems too good to be true, it may be. Shady projects have falsely listed A-list advisors. If you see that a prominent figure has signed on to advise, research whether that person is really associated with the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any information regarding the team and advisors should be front and center in a whitepaper. If it’s not, regard it as a red flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are considering investing in an established coin, check whether it has stayed true to its whitepaper and roadmap. If it hasn’t, you might want to steer clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Trading history\n",
      "\n",
      "For established, actively traded cryptocurrencies, it’s important to consider trading history. Even if you intend to HODL, it’s best to choose a cryptocurrency that is actively traded and liquid. When investors know they can enter and exit positions without slippage, they’re more likely to invest. This bodes well for price appreciation. To avoid fake trading volume, use metrics like Transparent Volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also important to analyze price movement. Cryptoassets that constantly experience wild price fluctuations may be targets of pump-and-dump schemes or other manipulative trading practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Strong community\n",
      "\n",
      "Look for cryptoasset projects with supportive, active communities. Most projects have public Telegram or Slack channels where you can communicate with community or team members. There’s usually information on Reddit and Twitter as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "When interacting with members of a crypto community, be sure to take everything with a grain of salt. Opinions may be biased and few community members will have the technical expertise to properly judge or communicate a project’s pros and cons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that some projects, even those with large communities, rely on paid PR to boost investor interest. Take hype for what it is, and always do your own research. It’s also worth noting that projects with clear goals and real-world use cases tend to market themselves the least. They give interviews, periodically release announcements, and maintain a social media presence, but they don’t pay people to hype.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. A competitive edge\n",
      "\n",
      "Pay attention to the competition. You may have found a project that promises to create real-world value for thousands or millions of users, but what if there’s another team with the same goal in mind? In a crowded market, the slightest edge in time to market or user experience can make a huge difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "When evaluating an ICO, consider where a project is in its development. Some tokens launch with little more than a whitepaper and a prayer. Others have beta versions on the market and are actively collecting user feedback. In rare cases, there is a working product. Though it can be profitable to invest in very early-stage ICOs, it’s safest to choose a project that either has a working product or is close to releasing one. A working product means that development is at an advanced stage, which signals that the ideas behind the project have been tested, if not in the wild then under circumstances that closely mimic the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a competitor project, consider where they are in their development. If they’re closer to a working product, they could seize a significant portion of the market while claiming first-mover advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to look for is whether a project is backed by venture capital. If VCs support a project, it signals that it has a sound business philosophy, good leadership, and a real-world application. Venture capital can also bring credibility to a project, which attracts other investors and drives up the price. Don’t forget to check whether top VCs back the competition. If they do, it may indicate that a competitor is less risky, possibly because it has a stronger business plan or a more experienced CEO or dev team.\n",
      "\n",
      "When evaluating a cryptoasset, it’s vital to understand what type of project it is. We listed five categories: utility tokens, security tokens, asset tokens, currencies, and reward tokens. We then discussed the characteristics of good cryptoasset projects: a sound business philosophy, a detailed whitepaper, liquidity (if it’s an established, actively traded coin), an active community, and a competitive edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, if a cryptoasset project wants your money, it’s on them to make the case. A project that’s worth your time and money will be transparent about their goals and operations.\n",

      "At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading at $6,748 with 0.00 percent movement in the past 24 hours. The world’s leading cryptocurrency with a market cap of $112 billion is managing a low daily trading volume of $3.5 billion.\n",

      "The highest gains are made of 13.11 percent by Nxt at $0.0672 and Polymath by 10.62 percent at $0.3259. A number of other cryptos are also up by 2 to 7 percent while the highest loss is of 7 percent.\n",

      "After continuously gaining for approximately nine years, the stock market is taking a U-turn and looks like any factor even a small one can take it to the bottom.
