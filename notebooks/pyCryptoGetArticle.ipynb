      "\n",
      "Cet article vous est présenté par la plateforme de trading et de copy-trading PrimeXBT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Le marché crypto est en berne depuis plusieurs semaines. « Bear market » et « hiver crypto » sont ainsi devenus deux expressions du jargon crypto que l’on entend régulièrement désormais. Pourtant, la situation n’est pas aussi mauvaise qu’elle paraît. Il pourrait même y avoir du bon dans la dépression des cours cryptos ! Comment cela ? Vitalik Buterin, créateur d’Ethereum nous l’explique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source : Pixabay\n",
      "\n",
      "​« bear market » ou « hiver crypto » ? Bref, les cours plongent !\n",
      "\n",
      "Déjà en méforme en fin d’année 2021, les cours cryptos ont poursuivi leur baisse depuis le début de l’année 2022. La situation aux frontières de l’Ukraine n’a fait que renforcer l’anxiété du marché crypto (et boursier). Suite à l’entrée des troupes russes en Ukraine, la journée risque de tourner au crash crypto. Un crash…. qui suit une conjoncture bearish dans son ensemble depuis plusieurs semaines maintenant. On parle alors de « bear market ». S’il existe plusieurs explications à cette expression , un « bear market » fait référence à une baisse globale des cours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Les plus pessimistes avancent même l’idée que le marché est entré dans un « crypto winter ». Cette expression fait référence à un phénomène plus important, une longue phase de repli des cours. Par exemple le dernier hiver crypto a eu lieu en 2018 et 2019. Sur cette période le cours du Bitcoin a dégringolé régulièrement pour passer de 19 000 $ à fin 2017 à 3 200 $ en 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alors assiste-t-on à un bear market uniquement lié au contexte géopolitique et sanitaire ? Ou alors est-on entré dans un hiver crypto qui va se poursuivre sur plusieurs mois ? Personne ne peut le dire, même Vitalik Buterin ne se risque pas au pronostic sur ce sujet ! Et puis, ce n’est pas le plus important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ce qui importe c’est de savoir que cette conjoncture baissière n’est pas mauvaise en soi si on regarde la situation dans son ensemble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source : Adobe / oatawa\n",
      "\n",
      "​Pour le créateur d’Ethereum, le bear market actuel est bénéfique pour le marché crypto\n",
      "\n",
      "La baisse du marché crypto est mauvaise pour le porte-monnaie des investisseurs. Mais pour Vitalik Buterin, le créateur d’Ethereum, c’est en revanche une bonne chose pour le domaine crypto dans son ensemble. Cela permet d’assainir le marché et donne l’occasion aux projets d’améliorer leur technologie.\n",
      "\n",
      "​Les bear markets permettent d’assainir le marché crypto\n",
      "\n",
      "Depuis plusieurs semaines, vous désespérez en regardant les cours cryptos ? Pas de panique ! Il faut regarder la situation dans son ensemble. D’ailleurs, récemment le fondateur de la crypto Ethereum Vitalim Buterin s’est exprimé à ce sujet.\n",
      "\n",
      "« Les gens ont beaucoup mordu dans la crypto, et en particulier dans la construction d’applications, beaucoup d'entre eux accueillent favorablement un marché baissier. (…) Ils accueillent favorablement le marché baissier parce que lorsqu'il y a ces longues périodes où les prix augmentent énormément, cela rend évidemment beaucoup de gens heureux mais cela est aussi une forte invitation à la spéculation à très court terme. » Vitalik Buterin, créateur d’Ethereum\n",
      "\n",
      "Ainsi, pour lui, le bear market permet d’assainir le marché crypto. Comment ? Cela purge le marché des investisseurs spéculateurs à court terme, très présents lorsque le marché affiche de belles performances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source : Adobe / Trueffelpix\n",
      "\n",
      "​Les bear market permettent aux projets de renforcer leur technologies\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour Vitalik Buterin, les bear markets sont également l’occasion de tester la robustesse des nombreux projets cryptos en développement.\n",
      "\n",
      "« Les ‘hivers’ [crypto winters] sont le moment où beaucoup de ces applications chutent et vous pouvez voir quels projets sont réellement durables à long terme, du point de vue de leurs modèles et de leurs équipes et employés. » Vitalik Buterin, créateur d’Ethereum\n",
      "\n",
      "De plus, lors de bear market, il y a moins d’utilisateurs cryptos. Aussi, pour lui, c’est un bon moment pour les firmes cryptos pour se concentrer sur leur technologie et travailler sur le fond. Ainsi, lorsque le marché reprendra des couleurs, les structures seront suffisamment solides pour gérer l’afflux d’utilisateurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "C’est d’ailleurs ce que fait Ethereum qui travaille depuis plusieurs mois à l’implémentation de mises à jours structurelles. Celles-ci visent à améliorer la scalabilité du réseau Ethereum, qui est l’une des faiblesses de la blockchain pour le moment. A l’heure actuelle, le cours de l’ETH est de 2 363 $. Comme beaucoup d’autres cryptos, il est en chute libre de 23 points sur les 7 derniers jours.\n",

      "Text: After dipping to $40,000 yesterday, bitcoin went on the offensive and tapped $42,000 to mark a near 10-day high. The altcoins have also turned green today, with Ethereum eyeing $3,000 and Avalanche soaring by over 9%.\n",

      "The primary cryptocurrency experienced enhanced volatility last week when it suddenly pumped by $3,000 in minutes from $39,000 to nearly $42,000. However, the situation reversed shortly after, and the asset retraced just as quickly to its starting level.\n",
      "\n",
      "It reclaimed $40,000 a day later, but then the US Federal Reserve confirmed its plans to raise the interest rates by 25 basis points. Consequently, bitcoin slid once again and dropped by around $1,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, this price retracement was short-lived, and the cryptocurrency went on the offensive again. It remained around and above $40,000 for the next few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hours ago, though, bitcoin initiated another leg up by briefly exceeding $42,000 for the first time since March 10. As of now, the asset stands just under that level, and its market capitalization is close to $800 billion.\n",

      "Alts in Green Led by AVAX\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative coins were also relatively calm in the past few days, but green now dominates the market. Ethereum is among the best performers from the larger-cap alts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second-largest crypto is up by 5% and stands well above $2,900. Roughly a week ago, ETH had dipped below $2,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "Binance Coin, Ripple, Terra, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu are also well in the green with increases of between 2% and 5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avalanche is the most significant gainer from the larger-caps with a 9.5% surge. As a result, AVAX stands above $85.\n",
      "\n",
      "More daily increases come from SNX (22%), Zcash (13%), Waves (12.5%), THORChain (11%), Fantom (10%), and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the crypto market cap has added around $80 billion in a day and is close to $1.9 trillion.\n",
