Meanwhile, the crypto market is holding the fort as the top cryptos register greens and maintain stability.

Crypto Market Stable while Global Stock Market Seeing Red

The environment of the Crypto market is having gloomy days for some time now. There is almost no activity in the market despite the global share market taking a hit each passing day.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading at $6,748 with 0.00 percent movement in the past 24 hours. The world’s leading cryptocurrency with a market cap of $112 billion is managing a low daily trading volume of $3.5 billion.

With a 0.12 percent rise, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $204 billion while XRP, the third largest cryptocurrency is in the green by 0.18 percent at $0.4482.

Other cryptos in the green are Stellar (XLM) by 0.04 percent at $0.2299 while Monero (XMR) is up by 0.53 percent at $103 and Dash by 0.69 percent at $155. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS, and Litecoin are rising by 0.34, 0.05 and 0.09 percent respectively.

Out of the top cryptos, Cardano (ADA) is in the red by 0.18% and Tron (TRX) is falling by 0.09 percent while IOTA (MIOTA) is down by 0.56 percent.

The highest gains are made of 13.11 percent by Nxt at $0.0672 and Polymath by 10.62 percent at $0.3259. A number of other cryptos are also up by 2 to 7 percent while the highest loss is of 7 percent.

This has total cryptocurrency market cap stuck at $209 billion in the past 24 hours.

Crypto market is unaffected by the ongoing fall in the global market, unlike the last time when cryptos lost significant value in tandem with the stock market.

Meanwhile, the global stock market is falling at a much higher speed than it lifted off. Chinese market seems to be doing the worst due to its slow economic growth and being in a trade war with the US.

Bloomberg quoted Michael O’Rourke, the chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “What’s the positive catalyst for the future to take this market higher to the next level? Right now, there isn’t one.”

After continuously gaining for approximately nine years, the stock market is taking a U-turn and looks like any factor even a small one can take it to the bottom. While cryptos are maintaining stability and keeping low volatility which has been characterized as a positive phenomenon is expected to have them become an attractive asset for the traditional investors

Mati Greenspan, senior analyst at eToro has been recently quoted as saying,

“The fact that the current stock market rout has not had any effect whatsoever (positive or negative) on the crypto assets is an extremely positive sign. This is a prime example of how cryptos are uncorrelated and it only serves to increase their use case as a powerful tool for asset management.”"

Cryptocurrency markets are suffering from deep losses today, on June 10, 2018, as most digital assets are seeing 24-hour declines between 9 and 25 percent. The number one position, held by Bitcoin Core (BTC), dropped more than a $1,000 just a few hours ago, from $7,600 to $6,600, but prices have rebounded back to $6,787 per BTC. The fourth highest valued market, held by Bitcoin Cash (BCH), dropped around $225 in value after hovering around $1,150 for a while. The currency is now averaging $933 per BCH. It’s safe to say market participants are shaken and many are curious about why the market keeps sliding.

Crypto Markets Take a Jab to the Gut This Weekend

A dump took place today that hit markets below the belt, as most cryptocurrencies lost significant values. Last week, towards the beginning of the weekend, markets were pretty stable and consolidating tightly into a triangular formation. Then, on Saturday, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Justice Department revealed they had subpoenaed four major exchanges while looking into their cryptocurrency price manipulation investigation. Just before that moment on June 9, just like last time when U.S. regulators initially announced the manipulation probe, markets slid about 1-hour before the announcement. Today’s drop was harder to put the blame on as it could have been an after effect from yesterday’s announcement, the fact that market volumes are extremely thin, or some blamed it on the small exchange from South Korea Coinrail being hacked this weekend for $40Mn worth of ICO tokens.

BTC Market Action

On Sunday, June 10, Bitcoin Core (BTC) markets are down 9.8 percent and over the past seven days, BTC markets are under by 11 percent. This means most of the losses have taken place this weekend as BTC volatility was fairly nonexistent at the beginning of the week. Right now BTC’s overall market capitalization is around $115Bn with a dominance level of around 38 percent. Trade volume is super weak and this is why a lot of traders are skeptical these days because 24-hour volumes today were around $4Bn, but since the last drop volumes jumped to $5.5Bn over the past hour. The top exchanges today swapping the most BTC are Bitfinex, Binance, Okex, Huobi, and GDAX. The Japanese yen is dominating BTC currency pairs big time commanding more than 60 percent of BTC trades at the time of publication. This is followed by the USD (19.2%) tether (USDT 13.5%), EUR (2.7%), and the KRW (2.2%). Of course, there was a significant drop in South Korean won-BTC pair action today.

BTC /USD Technical Indicators

Looking at the charts shows BTC bulls had mustered up some strength to push above the $6800 zone but the fight was a real struggle. 4-hour charts show the two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) have a good sized gap between them with the 200 SMA well above the 100 SMA trendline. This means bearish sentiment may continue during the short term and markets are very close to a triple bottom. After the last push the MACd is heading downwards and RSI levels are very low too (15.78) indicating oversold conditions. Daily Bollinger Bands (B-bands) are seeing a significant coil and buyers below the current vantage point are itching for lower prices. Looking at order books shows bears will see pit stops around $6,400 and the triple bottom $5,900 region. If bulls can heal right now, after that intense beating, then they need to overcome big walls around $7,300 and 7,800 to at least catch some fresh air from the onslaught.

BCH Market Action

After a few solid weeks of BTC being the dominant pair with Bitcoin Cash (BCH), today tether USDT has taken the lead at 31.77 percent. This is followed by BTC (31.5%), USD (21.9%), KRW (9.1%), and the EUR (1.9%). Bitcoin Cash has lost around 16.4 percent over the last 24-hours and 19 percent over the last seven days. This Sunday, the total market capitalization for BCH is around $15.9Bn with about $693Mn in 24-hour trade volume. The top trading platforms exchanging the most Bitcoin Cash today include Okex, Binance, Huobi, Bitfinex, and Lbank. The losses in BCH values have been very much correlated with BTC market tumbles but prices have still remained around 0.14 BTC per BCH.

BCH /USD Technical Indicators

Looking at BCH charts on Bitfinex shows similar indicators, as the two Simple Moving Averages have a decent gap like BTC with the 100 SMA below the long-term 200 SMA. Again, this indicates the path of least resistance will be towards the downside. RSI levels show oversold conditions (30) and the MACd is sliding southbound as well at the time of writing. Daily B-bands are also extremely tight, showing a massive consolidation period taking place. Looking at order books indicates that bears will have a hard fight until 910 and then another pit stop at $860. If things go lower than that, markets are going to look ugly all around. BCH bulls need to recharge and bust past $985 but buyers will also be deterred around $1,020, as sell orders are piling up around that region.

The Top Cryptocurrency Markets

Overall, the top cryptocurrencies are down, except for ‘stablecoins’ like tether and the various others allegedly pegged to the USD. The second largest market valuation today belongs to Ethereum (ETH) but its markets are down 13.9 percent. One ETH is trading for $517 and the currency is the most swapped coin on Shapeshift today, but traded for BTC. The third largest market, Ripple (XRP), is down 13.8 percent and one XRP is trading for $0.57 cents per token. Lastly, the fifth highest valued market commanded by EOS is down significantly at 21 percent this Sunday. At the moment, EOS is trading around $11.25 per coin and holds the fourth largest trade volume over the last 24-hours.

The Verdict: Skepticism and the Search for That Confounded Bottom

You can probably guess what our market verdict is today without reading the sub-title above, as things are looking bearish and everyone knows this fact. Because markets keep sliding, then recovering, then sliding downwards, even more, has caused enthusiasts and traders to be skeptical of any bullish signals. Most traders are looking curiously for ‘the bottom’ and when that time will be, so right now many are just playing musical chairs looking for the right positions.

2018-04-21 18:30:06+00:00	Bitcoin Nears $9,000 As Crypto Buy Orders Compose 92% of Market	['Sam Town', 'Chainwire', 'Samuel Wan', 'Andjela Radmilac', 'News Desk']	"For the first time since March 2017, buy orders now compose over 92% of market activity. Hot on the heels of a massive $120 billion recovery, the massive surge in buy orders heralds an impending bull market that could potentially exceed the monstrous late 2017 run up.

Data from TurtleBC demonstrates that cryptocurrency buy market percentage across a diverse range of coins including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, NEM, and money is currently at a massive 92.86%, greater than the December 2017 high of 88%.

Bitcoin Gains $1,000 in One Week

With so many buy orders placing pressure on the cryptocurrency market, a significant price shift is highly likely. Buy order presence isn’t the only indicator that hints toward a massive run up in the near future, however — with Bitcoin exhibiting a meteoric $1,000 jump over the last three days, investors are moving in quickly to capitalize on what is anticipated to be a return to the $10,000 BTC psychological barrier.

Cryptocurrency market observers are calling for a dramatic increase in Bitcoin values sooner rather than later. Notably, Fundstrat co-founder and head of research Thomas Lee has reiterated his frequent bullish predictions, forecasting a year-end target BTC value of $25,000.

In an interview with CNBC last week, Lee predicted a 225% increase from the $7,662 BTC value at the time of his statements:

“We still feel pretty confident that bitcoin is a great risk-reward and we think it could reach $25,000 by the end of the year … It’s overdue. Bitcoin was incredibly oversold”

While Lee is notorious within the cryptocurrency community for his consistently bullish position on Bitcoin, his prediction that selling pressure would ease subsequent to tax day in the US was correct.

Big Business Moves into Blockchain as Traditional Finance Remains Bearish

Early April has also seen a spate of institutional money — including major Wall Street players and financial juggernaut George Soros — enter the cryptocurrency market.

This significant flow of investment capital could contribute to market health as the blockchain industry matures.

While market sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, not all predictions are bullish. One of the most interesting predictions of the last month comes from Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, who stated in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin is likely to trade at $100 per token by 2028 — disappointing news to John McAfee.

“I think Bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we’re headed out 10 years from now … I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000 ten years from now”

Rogoff, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, appears unaware of the utility of BTC or the implications of Lightning Network implementation, stating that “if you take away the possibility of money laundering and tax evasion, its actual uses as a transaction vehicle are very small.”

The sheer level of capital that is currently being invested in the blockchain industry makes it highly unlikely that Bitcoin — the undisputed market cap king — will be falling from grace any time soon. Recent employment statistics demonstrate that blockchain-based job positions have doubled in the last three months as enterprise organizations prepare for the incoming blockchain revolution.

Blockchain is Here to Stay

As the oldest, most valuable, and most liquid crypto-asset, Bitcoin is considered the “gold standard” of the blockchain, and can be exchanged for virtually every other altcoin on the market.

There are now thousands of merchants that accept Bitcoin directly as payment, and with LocalBitcoin volume recently at an all time high, it’s never been easier to exchange BTC directly for fiat currency.

Bitcoin, altcoins, and blockchain technology is here to stay. Interestingly, the Delaware State Senate has recently passed an act that explicitly allows for the use of blockchains to maintain corporate share registries, making it highly likely that crypto-assets will replace traditional securities entirely.

With cryptocurrency buy order ratios reaching an all-time high and tax season finally over, the impending crypto bull run to end all bull runs isn’t just possible — it’s inevitable."

He Digs Gibson Guitars That Sound Like Tyrannosauruses', 'Romantic', 'Victorian Poetry', 'Franco-Era Spanish Films', 'Lps', 'Chelsea Fc', 'Bob Dylan', 'Pilot', 'Black Coffee']	"How many financial firms are looking to get involved with cryptocurrency? Twenty percent, according to an industry poll conducted by Thomson Reuters — and that’s likely just the start.

The Herd is Approaching

A survey by Canadian multinational mass media and information firm Thomson Reuters found that 20 percent of its more than 400 clients are considering making a concerted push into the cryptocurrency market within the next half year.

Neill Penney, the co-head of trading at Thomson Reuters explained:

Cryptocurrency is still a relatively small part of the trading market, but this survey makes clear this niche segment is starting to enter the mainstream of the financial services industry. This is a major change from a year ago.

Indeed, even those in the financial world uninterested in the cryptocurrency market would be unwise to completely ignore its quick-profit potential. Bill Barhydt, the CEO of American Express-backed cryptocurrency startup Abra, told Business Insider last month:

I talk to hedge funds, high net worth individuals, even commodity speculators. They look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see it as a huge opportunity. Once that happens, all hell will break loose.

Wall Street is Ready to Join the Party

Thomson Reuters’ results come after Goldman Sachs announced the hiring of former trader Justin Schmidt, who will head the multinational investment bank’s and financial services company’s digital asset markets in Goldman’s securities division.

Schmidt previously served as both a senior VP at Seven Eight Capital and portfolio manager at LMR Partners and has apparently been brought on by an increased interest in cryptocurrency from Goldman’s clients. Said Goldman Sach’s spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin-Cohen:

In response to client interest in various digital products, we are exploring how best to serve them in the space. At this point, we have not reached a conclusion on the scope of our digital asset offering.

The increased interest from Goldman’s clients coincides with a general increase in interest from Wall Street, at large — where many individuals were late to the party after last year’s epic bull run. Don’t expect them to miss the boat this time.

Cryptocurrency markets are still at the bottom following their mid-week dump. There has been no sign of a bounce back to previous levels as total market capitalization is still hovering just above $200 billion.

Bitcoin has remained on a flat line since its Thursday dump of $300. BTC fell to $6,300 and is currently trading just below that level, it has fallen 5% since the same time last weekend. Ethereum is also very depressed at the moment after falling back to $200 and remaining there for the past 3 days.

Altcoins are mostly in the red this morning, but movements are minimal. Looking at the top ten nothing is really moving more than a percent or so in either direction. Cardano has lost almost 2% on the day to fall back to $0.073. The rest are flat this Sunday during Asian trading.

The top twenty is showing similar lethargy at the moment with most cryptos shifting around a percent up or down on the day. Dash is showing the greatest gain which is just 1.7% bringing it to $161, while Tezos is falling back by a similar amount dropping it to $1.22.

The fomo induced pump of the day in the top one hundred is currently Digitex Futures which has surged 47% in the past 24 hours. These unnatural spikes usually happen when new altcoins increase in market cap but they often dump again just as quickly. Time will tell if DGTX can hold its gains. Aion has also done well since the dump, today it is up 18%. At the red end of the table is Noah Coin dumping all of its recent gains and falling back 26% on the day. MaidSafeCoin is also having a tough Sunday with an 11% slide.

Total crypto market capitalization has not moved over the past 24 hours and is still very low at $202 billion. Trade volume has dipped below $10 billion for the first time since the end of August and crypto markets look very dejected at the moment. Markets are back to the same level they were at this time last month which appears to be the bottom, unless another dump is imminent.

Aunts and uncles asking about internet money as you passed the mashed potatoes while trying to explain the concept of decentralization in a way that made it seem like you knew your stuff.

Well, as we near a year since many of the top tokens hit their all-time highs, we’ve seen the prices come crashing down as more manageable expectations of the crypto market have seemed to prevail. You probably didn’t have quite as many relatives picking your brain this year for crypto investment tips.

Today, we saw another hit to the market. All but eight of the top 100 cryptocurrency tokens are down for the 24-hour period, with most losses averaging around 13 or 14 percent.

Notably, Bitcoin has now fallen beneath the $4,000 threshold, a number it reached in August of last year as its trajectory pointed sharply upward. Ethereum is trading just over $111, while Litecoin has fallen below $30 — far cries from their former glory.

The cryptocurrency space is a volatile one, but the year-long downward trend has been consistent and unrelenting, leaving many to wonder where and when some of these top tokens will settle down."

Bitcoin–and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole–plunged this year, after a gravity-defying surge in recent years. The price of the digital coin hit nearly $20,000 late last year. And then in early 2018, it began to fall. Though it hit a few plateaus, the price has still tumbled; today it hovers at a little over $3,000. So what happened? And is there any hope for a recovery? To answer both, you have to look at quite a few factors. The bubble When bitcoin was rising last year, it seemed like a trend everyone from your grandmother to your barista was suddenly becoming hip to. Of course plenty of folks cautioned that it could be a bubble, but it’s always hard to realize such a thing when you’re in the midst of it. It’s free money, right? Why not get in on it? (Just don’t remortgage your house!)

All the signs, however, were there. Like previous bubbles, people were basing their belief in the cryptocurrency on their emotions, not any intrinsic value. Then there was the FOMO element, which only compounded things. Essentially, bitcoin became an international fever. Random companies were “pivoting to blockchain” for no apparent reason other than that it seemed like a way to create buzz. But when the bubble bursts, FOMO turns into fear of losing, which makes for an especially rapid plunge. Among those who called it, hedge fund manager Mark Dow wrote almost exactly a year ago about his decision to short bitcoin after future trading on it first began: But this time feels different. It feels like a bubble. The fever in the post-Thanksgiving moonshot ran hotter than we’d seen before. We also began to see a robust supply response. Bubbles are complex dynamics. What they all have in common, however, is they require emotion to truly go parabolic. Moreover, the less we understand the object of the bubble, the greater the scope for greed and FOMO to fill in the blanks. Dow, at the time, simply could not come up with a good reason for the crypto’s insane performance. The only logical explanation: It’s a bubble. His views were especially prescient. He told Bloomberg this month that he made a profit twice due to this canny call.

Other early warning signs But to understand the dynamic that led to this year’s depressing year for crypto, we actually should start a few years before 2018. In bitcoin’s early days, Mt. Gox was the go-to service for handling transactions. Then, in 2014, it halted transactions and slowly copped to a crypto-hack to the tune of $473 million, the biggest hack of its kind at the time, and it gave many people pause. But it was still early enough for people to believe that the blockchain system was still getting all the technical kinks out. But the hacks didn’t stop. In 2016, the DAO–a blockchain organization that was based on Ethereum–lost what was worth $50 million at the time, due to a technical error someone seized upon. This, once again, sent shockwaves through the community–but also had the unfortunate impact of normalizing these types of hacks for some people. At the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018, more people–especially those in the mainstream finance world–were paying attention to bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading. And in early January 2018, the Japanese exchange Coincheck disclosed a hack worth a whopping $534 million. This happened right around the time that bitcoin slipped from its peak value, and it certainly seemed to accelerate its drop.

advertisement

According to Stephen Innes, the head of Asian trading for the foreign exchange Oanda, hacks were the first element to have a chilling effect on crypto. Hearing the amount of money that thieves were able to take, he says, “Consumers got very concerned that their money could go missing.” In the wake of both Coincheck’s hack–as well as a big one that hit the South Korean exchange Coinrail–governments in East Asia began to crack down. Over the course of a few months, China, Japan, and South Korea all announced different measures to better regulate crypto-trading. The world was watching to see if this new technology would hit the mainstream–and government crackdowns following gigantic hacks helped poison the public perception. Indeed, following its nearly $20,000 peak, bitcoin in early 2018 dropped to around $10,000 and hovered there for a while.

advertisement

Lack of institutional support Beyond the clampdown by some governments, what bitcoin really needed to achieve sustained success was overall mainstream acceptance. While some financial institutions announced projects exploring blockchain-based solutions, many others balked. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, made multiple comments throughout the year expressing his general antipathy for cryptocurrency. Dimon’s thoughts could most easily be summed with this quote: “I don’t really give a shit about bitcoin.” Warren Buffett also didn’t have kind words–calling it “probably rat poison squared”–which almost certainly sent a clear message to curious investors. When some of the most respected people on Wall Street make comments like that, it “takes a huge element of mainstream out of the market,” says Innes. Essentially, these heavy hitters were telling their minions that bitcoin wasn’t worth their time.

advertisement

Meanwhile, there has been plenty of speculation that bitcoin’s big rise may have been due to a pump-and-dump scheme. One theory that the U.S. Justice Department is reportedly looking into is that the digital coin Tether (which is supposedly pegged to the U.S. dollar to make for a less volatile cryptocurrency) was used to manipulate the bitcoin market and cause a large run-up in price. This theory stems from an academic paper, which cast Tether in a very damning light. And it also led many to believe that the initial bitcoin craze was manufactured and destined to bust. Another institutional hit for bitcoin–which probably had the most sustained effect–was the SEC’s refusal to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This would be a path for more mainstream people in finance to dabble with blockchain; it would allow investors to dip their toes in bitcoin without owning the actual asset. Not only that, but it would make bitcoin available on the most prominent financial markets. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), however, has yet to allow such a fund to exist–mostly because it is unable to monitor crypto-transactions in order to avoid market manipulation. The inability to get SEC approval really held back bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. It sent the message, says Innes, “that there wasn’t underlying support from Wall Street.” Meanwhile, the price dropped from around $10,000 to $6,000.

advertisement

Internal battles But it wasn’t just outside pessimism that led to the slump, but infighting as well. Blockchains are decentralized, and democratic systems require buy-in from participants in order to keep the engines running. When there’s a schism that can’t be decided by the majority, all hell breaks loose. In 2016, this became apparent with the DAO hack. One way to fix the problem was to implement what’s known as a “hard fork,” which would essentially update the Ethereum-based software to fix the technical gaffe that caused the hack to begin with. But DAO users had to agree to this change, and there were dissenters. Though the hard fork was approved, it created two active blockchains with two different sets of rules. Ultimately, this hack–coupled with the inability to deal with it–caused the DAO to end in 2016. This year we saw a similar fight break out–this time over bitcoin cash. This coin, mind you, is not bitcoin, though it is built on the same architecture. It was created by a group of miners who disagreed with some of the fundamentals of the initial bitcoin system, and so they forked a new blockchain and went their own way. In terms of market capitalization, bitcoin cash has always been one of the top cryptocurrencies–in the ranks of Ethereum and XRP.

advertisement

This past autumn, the bitcoin cash community–which was created due to a technical disagreement with the larger bitcoin sector–started a civil war. Essentially, bitcoin cash developers had diverging views on the software update for the system, and so they decided to implement another hard fork. This created two new bitcoin cash sects. Internally, the fork caused a lot of strife; one of the most popular bitcoin alternatives was unable to reach a consensus, and instead had to create two different paths that would essentially go to war with each other. When the hard fork arrived–and participants had to choose which path to take–the entire cryptocurrency market dropped. This is very likely what caused bitcoin to drop from the $6,000 range to around the $3,000-$4,000 range. Which brings us to today, with the cryptocurrency bottoming out at less than 80% of what it was a year ago. Is there any hope? We’re certainly in a much different place now than we were 12 months ago. What was a hot commodity has turned into a hot potato nobody wants to touch. Still, this almost certainly won’t be the end for bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies as a whole. Despite the realization that it was a bubble, even the toughest critics see some sort of a future.

advertisement

Dow, the man who first shorted bitcoin, for instance, even mentioned in his initial post that a person can be “simultaneously bullish on blockchain and bearish on bitcoin.” And he just announced that he’s ending his short. Meanwhile, even the most enthusiastic bitcoin evangelists are realizing that a retooling is in order. Michael J. Casey, a senior adviser for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, recently wrote about how the crypto-winter has arrived, but it may lead to better things down the line: The good news is that the glare of public opinion will eventually dissipate, and that as the spotlight diminishes, real developers will find themselves in a healthier environment within which to do the work needed to unlock this technology’s potential. We saw a similar period of constructive building during the 2014-2016 hiatus. But whatever new products are produced, they will now have a harder time struggling with acceptance. Whether we like it or not, message and image are important. That seems to be the overall message from most. Even Innes, who has been critical of bitcoin and crypto-trading for quite a while, admits that this doesn’t mean the blockchain is bunk. He, in fact, sees things looking up. “If this base can hold,” he says, “[the price will] start drifting up.” But not because of fervor or blind faith that bitcoin is the future, but due to advances on the technology side.

advertisement

“This is a legitimate technology–it’s going to expand,” he says, “My longer-term view is nowhere near where some of [my current] views are.” It could even perhaps hit $10,000 again, he says. But that will probably take a few years. For now, we wait and see."

2018-05-01 00:00:00+00:00	More Big Cryptocurrency News at Trading Technologies: Announcing TT® Crypto	['Trading Technologies']	"Crypto. TT. And FREE.* Now that’s a combo worth writing about!

You can now trade cryptocurrencies for free through what we believe is the world’s greatest trading platform. Traders have been asking us for this functionality, and I’m excited to bring it to market. Yes, any exchange trading commission fees still apply, but we will charge no fees to use TT software. Here’s the scoop on that, with a little background to start.

Trading Technologies is a 24-year-old company providing software and services for the trading industry. Our lead product is a front-end platform simply known as TT®. Professional traders use TT as their trading interface to route orders to exchanges around the world. Most exchanges that TT connects to today are global futures exchanges. On March 1, we launched a connection to our first cryptocurrency spot market, Coinbase’s Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX). Traders are using TT today to trade spot crypto, and many are benefitting from having bitcoin futures and spot on the same screen by trading the difference between the two, known as the basis.

Today, we launched a separate and dedicated crypto-only version of our platform that we’re calling TT® Crypto. TT Crypto is a lightweight, cloud-based, scalable, high-performance (e.g., microsecond-fast) version of the TT platform.

With this sleek new infrastructure, we can now open it up to the masses and offer it for no fee. TT Crypto provides all the same functionality of TT that professional traders rely on, such as:

Customizable trading screen

Ability to do single-click trading on an elegant vertical trade ladder

Professional-grade charting and analytics tools

Advanced order types, such as bracket, iceberg, OCO, trailing limit and our own soon-to-be-released version of a post-only order type

Our Autospreader® engine for auto-trading differential levels between two different digital assets

Our ADL® DIY trading algorithm builder that allows a user to set logic based on their own creativity. ADL is a great tool for market-making programs. You can even import your own data through Excel.

24/7 market access—just like the exchanges

Fully functional mobile apps for iOS and Android, a rarity in crypto!

TT is not an exchange, we’re not a wallet or custodian, and we’re not a market-maker. We are a front-end system, and we route your orders to an exchange. We provide trading infrastructure. Today, we route orders to Coinbase’s GDAX exchange. In time, it is likely we will grow the list of exchanges we connect to.

To get set up to trade on TT Crypto, you first have to open and fund a GDAX account at www.gdax.com. Once you’ve done that, you can create a TT Crypto login at crypto.trade.tt and follow our easy steps to connect it to your Coinbase account.

So check it out today at tt-crypto.com. We’ve been doing this for many years, feel like we have a great product for the broader market, and we’re excited to see what kind of positive impact TT Crypto can have on maturing and furthering the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets.

*TT Crypto is free of charge. Note however that GDAX charges still apply."
2018-08-14 00:00:00+00:00	Ethereum is down another 10% as the global crypto market goes into 'panic mode'	['Oscar Williams-Grut']	"Ethereum is down another 10% on Tuesday after falling 17% on Monday.

The cryptocurrency market has lost 10% of its value in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin dropped below $6,000 earlier in the session .

You can follow live cryptocurrency prices on Markets Insider.

LONDON — Ethereum's steep price fall continued on Tuesday as the entire cryptocurrency market continues to fall.

Ethereum is down just over 10% to $253.35 at 4.22 p.m. BST (11.22 a.m. ET). The current sell-off began on Monday, when Ethereum dropped to an 11-month low. Bloomberg reported that the slump was sparked by startups that had raised funding in ethereum through so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) now cashing their holdings into traditional fiat money they can spend on development.

Matthew Newton, an analyst at eToro, said in an email: ""The crypto market seems to have hit panic mode, with prices falling significantly across the board. As we can see in the case of ether, investors seem to be increasing liquidations of their ICO holdings, with significant drops in price and increased volumes.""

As of Tuesday morning London time, the value of the overall cryptocurrency market had fallen by about 10% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com, from $218 billion to $193 billion.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by value, dropped below the psychologically significant level of $6,000 early in the session before fighting back. Bitcoin was down 3.7% to $6,020.24 at 4.24 p.m. BST (11.24 a.m. ET).

Other major cryptocurrencies were suffering similar drops at the same time:

The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure since late June, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed a decision on whether to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, a move that bitcoin bulls believe would have greatly increased the size of the market.

""If an ETF doesn't see the light in the coming weeks expect to see a further selloff, as it suggests regulators will continue to fight against bringing cryptocurrencies into the mainstream,"" Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at FXTM, said in an email on Tuesday morning, adding that a break below $5,770 for bitcoin would ""intensify selling pressure as it's the only major support still standing.""

The slump comes as emerging-market currencies are selling off, spooked by last week's collapse of the Turkish lira against the dollar. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said in an email that this coincidence ""puts paid to the notion of cryptos as a safe haven play.""

""Ultimately USD and US Treasury notes are the only real safe harbour,"" Wilson said."
2018-07-20 00:00:00+00:00	Africa could be the next frontier for cryptocurrency	[]	"Interest in cryptocurrency, a form of digital currency, is growing steadily in Africa. Some economists say it is a disruptive innovation that will blossom on the continent.

Cryptocurrency is not bound by geography because it is internet based; its transactions are stored in a database called blockchain, which is a group of connected computers that record transactions in a ledger in real time.

The difference between cryptocurrency and, say, Visa or Mastercard, is that a cryptocurrency is not now regulated by government and doesn’t need middlemen, and transactions rely on the internet, which means they can happen anywhere in the world.

The big cryptocurrency global brands include Bitcoin, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, Lisk and Monero, but Bitcoin leads the pack in Africa. Created in 2009 by a person or people with the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, investors hope Bitcoin becomes the new mode of financial transaction in the digital age.

“Africa is rarely mentioned among the largest markets for cryptocurrency, but it may be set to steal a march over other markets,” says Rakesh Sharma, a business and technology journalist.

Mr. Sharma says that citizens of countries battling high inflation are likely to opt for cryptocurrency, because “with their paradigm of decentralization, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to disastrous central bank policies.”

Stealing a march

South Sudan’s inflation rate was 102% between September 2016 and September 2017, according to the World Bank. Other countries with double-digit inflation rates include Egypt, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is no surprise that some of these countries are among the main Bitcoin economies in Africa. The main Bitcoin countries are Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe, according to gobitcoin.io, a website dedicated to Bitcoin news in Africa. The BBC adds that cryptocurrency is gaining ground in Uganda.

When Zimbabwe’s inflation skyrocketed in 2015, forcing authorities to print $100 trillion notes (each worth just $40), some Zimbabweans turned to Bitcoin.

Zimbabweans and citizens of other African countries transact in Bitcoin “as opposed to their local currencies, which are plagued with hyperinflation,” comments Emmanuel Tokunbo Darko, vice president of marketing for ICOWatchlist.com, a platform that hosts cryptocurrency tokens.

There will be 725 million mobile phone subscribers in Africa by 2020, according to the GSM Association, which represents the interests of mobile operators globally. That means more Africans will have the tools to plug into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, says Mr. Sharma.

“I check my Bitcoin every day [on my mobile phone] and any chance I can get. Any minute, any hour, anytime, as often as I can,” Peace Akware, a Ugandan millennial, told the BBC.

Bitcoin spreads

That African governments are not now regulating cryptocurrency may be a factor spurring its growth on the continent; however, there is no guarantee that governments will not change their current mindset.

Rather than simply not wanting to, governments may be powerless to regulate cryptocurrency, the Nigerian central bank indicated recently. Currently tackling the country’s 12% inflation rate, the Nigerian apex bank announced that it could not control or regulate Bitcoin, “just the same way no one is going to control or regulate the internet. We don’t own it.”

Fearing a collapse of the banking industry or arbitrary appropriation of money by the government, Africans without access to banks and who live in politically unstable countries could be attracted to cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin transactions help to eliminate the procedural bottlenecks that plague traditional banking and financial services,” Mr. Darko explains.

Some 15 cryptocurrency-related operations began in Africa in the past year alone, reports Mr. Sharma. But South Africa–based Luno Exchange, established in 2013 and now boasting 1.5 million customers in over 40 countries worldwide, is the first to be based in Africa.

Others, particularly cryptocurrency-based remittance services, are popping up in various countries. These services include Abra, which operates in Malawi and Morocco, GeoPay in South Africa, BitMari in Zimbabwe and London-based Kobocoin, which was launched by Nigerian entrepreneur Felix Onyemechi Ugoji.

The Plaas Application is a mobile app that enables farmers to manage their stock on the blockchain.

Launched in 2013, Kenya’s BitPesa facilitates virtual remittances transfers to both African and international locations, to and from individuals’ mobile wallets, where cryptocurrency is stored. LocalBitcoins.com in Kenya reported trading volumes in excess of $1.8 million as of December 2017, underlining the lucrativeness of the business.

“I started mining Bitcoin [in Nairobi, Kenya] in September 2017 and, so far, this is the best business I have ever tried,” Gladys Laboi told Africa Renewal, adding: “Under six months, I earned $800 after investing in $700.”

Not to be left out, some governments are moving into the virtual currency terrain. Tunisia’s eDinar is a government-issued digital currency. Senegal is in the process of creating eCFA, which, if successful, could be emulated by other Francophone countries in Africa.

There will be government-issued cryptocurrencies in Africa in the near future, predicts Shireen Ramjoo, ceo of Liquid Crypto-Money, a South Africa-based cryptocurrency consulting firm.

Industry experts believe that cryptocurrency will be around for years. That Bitcoin users can send money to just about anywhere there is an internet connection for relatively small fees and with no third-party interference is an advantage that standard government-issued currencies cannot offer.

“Every single computer device on the surface of the planet with an internet connection can access information on the blockchain and make ‘transactional’ inputs onto it. The information cannot be distorted, deleted, modified or destroyed, and [the] computer device has the same information as everybody,” says Mr. Darko.

Another recommendation is that transactions are anonymous, and users’ information is private and safe; there is little possibility of identity theft, which is common with other forms of digital payment.

As of December 2017, the global demand for cryptocurrency had increased to the extent that a Bitcoin sold for $20,000. Its value had been $1,000 one year prior.

Ponzi scheme

Nevertheless, some industry watchers refer to cryptocurrency as a risky and temperamental scheme, citing the crash to $8,700 in the value of Bitcoin last February, from a high of $20,000 in December 2017.

Without regulations, cryptocurrency is a double-edged sword; there may be gains from time to time, but any precipitous crash in price could leave investors with no escape route. Manasseh Egedegbe, an investment manager based in Nigeria, says that Bitcoin’s frenzied prize surge seems like the dot-com bubble at the turn of the millennium.

There is also the fact that cryptocurrency can be used by criminals to funnel funds. In 2011 Bitcoin was a currency of choice for drug peddlers, according to the US Justice Department, which seized almost $48 million worth of illegal contrabands that year, and discovered that the criminals involved had made transactions totaling 150,000 Bitcoins (approximately $130 million.

Countries such as Bangladesh, Ecuador and Kyrgyzstan believe the risks outweigh the gains and have banned Bitcoin as well as initial coin offerings or ICOs, which are used by start-ups to evade the demand for capital by banks and other financing institutions.

Quartz Africa, an online business news publication, reported last December that a similar scheme, Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox (MMM), once had over two million users in Nigeria, while also operating in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

There are reports that South Africa’s central bank is actively studying cryptocurrency and may institute guidelines to foster innovation. Those guidelines could be a slippery slope to regulation. The Sunday Times of South Africa reported in March that 27,500 individuals, including South Africans, lost more than $50 million when they were duped into transferring their Bitcoins into an online wallet. The publication called it “one of the biggest scams to hit South Africa.”

At 22% (the world average is 48%), Africa has the lowest rate of Internet usage of any region, according to a 2017 report by the International Communications Union, which may undercut optimistic projections of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology on the continent. Also, poor power supply in many countries continues to impede the internet access on which cryptocurrency largely depends.

Despite some analysts likening Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to a Ponzi scheme, many Africans are taking the risk to invest in them.

Other experts, such as Mr. Darko, believe Africa should warmly embrace the innovation. “Truth be told, Africa needs blockchain technology and its resultant cryptocurrencies more than any part of the world,” he says."
2018-04-06 08:16:55+00:00	Cryptocurrency derivatives	[]	"We are aware of a growing number of UK firms offering so-called cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related assets. As indicated in our Feedback Statement on DLT, cryptocurrencies are not currently regulated by the FCA provided they are not part of other regulated products or services.

Cryptocurrency derivatives are, however, capable of being financial instruments under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MIFID II), although we do not consider cryptocurrencies to be currencies or commodities for regulatory purposes under MiFID II. Firms conducting regulated activities in cryptocurrency derivatives must, therefore, comply with all applicable rules in the FCA’s Handbook and any relevant provisions in directly applicable European Union regulations.

It is likely that dealing in, arranging transactions in, advising on or providing other services that amount to regulated activities in relation to derivatives that reference either cryptocurrencies or tokens issued through an initial coin offering (ICO), will require authorisation by the FCA. This includes:

cryptocurrency futures – a derivative contract in which each party agrees to exchange cryptocurrency at a future date and at a price agreed by both parties

– a derivative contract in which each party agrees to exchange cryptocurrency at a future date and at a price agreed by both parties cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs) – a cash-settled derivative contract in which the parties to the contract seek to secure a profit or avoid a loss by agreeing to exchange the difference in price between the value of the cryptocurrency CFD contract at its outset and at its termination

– a cash-settled derivative contract in which the parties to the contract seek to secure a profit or avoid a loss by agreeing to exchange the difference in price between the value of the cryptocurrency CFD contract at its outset and at its termination cryptocurrency options – a contract which grants the beneficiary the right to acquire or dispose of cryptocurrencies

If you are unsure whether your firm requires authorisation, the FCA’s general guidance on the regulatory perimeter in PERG may be helpful. We also encourage you to seek expert advice if you have any remaining questions.

It is firms’ responsibility to ensure that they have the appropriate authorisation and permission to carry on regulated activity. If your firm is not authorised by the FCA and is offering products or services requiring authorisation it is a criminal offence. Authorised firms offering these products without the appropriate permission may be subject to enforcement action.

Useful links

For further information on cryptocurrencies and ICOs, including the potential benefits and challenges of the underlying distributed ledger technology (DLT), please refer to Distributed Ledger Technology - Feedback Statement on Discussion Paper 17/03.

Furthermore, as indicated in our consumer warning on ICOs, an ICO may or may not fall within the FCA’s regulatory perimeter depending on the nature of the tokens issued.

We have also issued a warning on the risks of investing in cryptocurrency CFDs."

Please Sir, Can We Find the Floor?

The market’s looking for support, folks. Ever since Bitcoin failed to break $10k, assets across the board have been bleeding and prices have yet to find a floor.

If you were hoping for a post-Consensus pump per historical precedent, I wouldn’t hold my breath. With a total market capitalization of $366bln, Consensus did little to save the market from the 4.6% drop it experienced over the course of the week. Sure, the loss isn’t catastrophic, but it is the second week in a row that we’ve seen negative price action.

As we watch Bitcoin flirt with $8k, expect lower prices still if we drop below this support level.

Bitcoin: Crypto’s #1 is down 6% on the week, holding just above the $8k threshold at $8,080.

Ethereum: Ethereum hasn’t moved much at all to speak of. At $675, it’s almost exactly where it was last Friday, only losing 0.4% over the week.

Ripple: In the same boat as Ethereum, Ripple is (almost) keeping its head above water, as it’s down just 1.4% at $0.66.

Ethereum Futures Contracts Hit the United Kingdom Trading Scene: The UK-regulated cryptocurrency exchange Crypto Facilities opened up trading for Ethereum futures this week. With the May 11 debut, the futures became the world’s first fully-regulated Ethereum derivatives. “Ether is the second most liquid cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, trading in the billions of dollars daily, and we are excited to be launching ETH futures.

Russia Weighs Legislation to Include Digital Economy Standards in Civil Codes: Russia’s lower legislative house, the State Duma, will hold a first reading for a bill that proposes including standards for crypto’s emerging digital economy in the Russian Federation’s Civil Codes. Overseen by the Committee for Legislative Work, the bill could “minimize the existing risks of using digital objects for transferring assets into an unregulated digital environment.” While, if signed into law, the bill would mean smart contracts are treated as written consent for legal proceedings, it does not grant cryptocurrencies status as legal tender under Russian law.

The global cryptocurrency market surged in the past 24 hours - its market capitalisation rising a staggering $78.6billion from $310.2billion at 12.45pm yesterday to $388.8billion at the same time today (February 7). The rise comes after a damaging month for cryptocurrencies as a whole. After peaking at about $834billion on January 7, the market plunged an eye-watering 66 percent, wiping out some $553billion, according to CoinMarketCap. But with Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum all back in the green today, many crypto experts are confident that the market can reach new heights this year.

Thomas Glucksmann of GateCoin told CNBC: “Increasing regulatory recognition of cryptocurrency exchanges, the entrance of institutional capital and major technology developments will contribute to the market's rebound and push cryptocurrency prices to all new highs this year.” He added that bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, could be “pushing $50,000 by December”. Bitcoin (BTC) fell as low as $6,048 on Tuesday - its worst price since November 13 - but a strong afternoon and overnight performance has seen it leap back well above the symbolic $8,000 mark today.

Meanwhile, bitcoin’s closest rivals Ethereum and Ripple have also soared by nearly 25 percent and 20 percent respectively in the past 24 hours.

We believe after February the market will likely go on a bull run Jamie Burke, CEO at Outlier Ventures

Jamie Burke, CEO at Outlier Ventures, is bullish about the cryptocurrency market, insisting it has the potential to reach $1trillion. He told CNBC: “We believe after February the market will likely go on a bull run comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in where the market becomes more focused on proper market fundamentals.” However, Fran Boait, from campaign group Positive Money, argues the crypto bubble has burst and will never fully recover its sky-high prices.

Unlike conventional stocks, shares, and other financial products, an all-coin portfolio cannot completely diversify risk because prices are closely correlated. Cryptocurrencies are essentially influenced by the same factors.

This crypto correlation has increased greatly. Data collected by Sifr shows the 14 coins in its index (including ETH, XRP, and LTC) have all moved more in tandem with Bitcoin over the past year.

The increase was greater in the six month period between August 2017 and February 2018. The BTC/ETH price correlation increased by 25%, XRP by 82% and LTC by 20%: the (mean) average increase was 32.6%, excluding Bitcoin Cash (which didn’t trade for the full year examined).

Although the market experienced its largest increases from August until December, there were significant corrections in the first two months, with the market’s total value plunging from over $800bn to $290bn by early February.

The correlation is higher during market slides and lower when the market improves. The correlation between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies subsided throughout July and early August when the BTC price went from around $6,500 to a peak of nearly $8,400. There was a noticeable uptick in correlation following the SEC’s postponement, as the graph below shows.

The BTC effect

High profile, accessibility, and (relatively) low volatility makes BTC an attractive option for investors looking to minimize risk but keep value in cryptocurrency. That Bitcoin’s position normally strengthens during bear markets, often leads to an increase in coin correlation.

This week shows just how much coins move in tandem with Bitcoin. The SEC’s decision this week to postpone its ruling on Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs sent shockwaves through the market, $36bn being wiped in less than 24 hours.

Bitcoin is at the epicenter: it’s in a unique position, as well as being the first cryptocurrency and the most accessible, it is also the largest. BTC dominance, the percentage of the market’s capitalization accounted for by Bitcoin, is at an all-year high.

BTC’s influence in the cryptocurrency market is strong, and news affecting Bitcoin’s price impacts the prices of other coins.

Crypto Correlation

This may not last for much longer. Although all coins were negatively affected by the ETF delay, some were affected far more than others. Of the top ten biggest coins, EOS, Stellar Lumens, and XRP all experienced price drops at equal or above 20%. Ether, on the other hand, only fell by 13%.

This could indicate a change in perception. If Ether’s price decrease is shallower than other leading coins then it indicates investors are staying put with ETH. There is no all-encompassing answer, but it might mean Ether’s price is less dependent on that of Bitcoin than other cryptocurrencies at earlier stages of development.

A coin’s price remains the most popular factor in gauging a project’s real-value and long-term viability, despite the pleas of founders and developers to heed the underlying fundamentals of the business and technology. Their value presently remains at the behest of speculation in many cases, and crypto correlation rests on the moves of the market leader, Bitcoin.

Volatility will inevitably decrease as cryptocurrencies begin to be valued on utility than on changes in the wind and scurrilous rumor, and as projects move to mainstream implementation, BTC dominated crypto correlation will become a thing of the past.

At that point, altcoins may finally be able to separate their value from the price of Bitcoin.

Well, there’s a handful of niche magazines and millions of webpages dedicated to covering cryptocurrency news, bitcoin trading, and digital currencies.

If you’re already writing about the intersection of finance and technology, you’re probably at least familiar with cryptocurrency.

But if you need proof cryptocurrency is a real thing, here’s just one example. There’s a $325 million luxury resort under development in Dubai, and investors are funding the project in bitcoin.

If you’re looking for a niche, there’s a growing demand for cryptocurrency news you can write about.

But it’s also a new way to get paid. In a recent survey of 1,100 freelancers, 29 percent said they prefer to be paid in cryptocurrency.

Want to learn how to tap into this niche and get paid in digital currency? Here’s what you need to know.

Bitcoin basics for freelance writers

Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currency whose value is derived from their usefulness. Remember the law of supply and demand from economics class?

Some cryptocurrencies have no purpose at all, which makes them extremely risky. Others, like Bitcoin, have a proven usefulness and a track record of increasing value.

A crash-course in blockchain technology

Stay with me, OK. The underlying technology for cryptocurrencies is called blockchain. Here’s a simple explanation of how it works:

Each cryptocurrency is created in a block, and organized in a chain based on a specific set of rules

It all happens in the digital universe using complex software coupled with super-strong cryptographic security measures.

And there’s more than one blockchain and cryptocurrency. There are more than 800 digital coins including Bitcoin, Steem, Ripple, Ethereum, Stellar, and many more.

This concludes today’s lecture. Clear as mud? This primer and this diagram should give you a basic understanding of how cryptocurrency technology works as a payment system.

Note: If you want to write about cyrptocurrency news, or accept digital currency payments from clients, do your homework.

The cryptocurrency opportunity for freelance writers

If you established yourself as a web copywriter in 1995, there were fewer than 30,000 websites. If you started back then, achieving expert status as a highly-sought-after copywriter would have been easier.

Why? By 2005, when there were over 64 million websites and far more freelance writers hustling for clients. Getting an early start would have benefited you in at least three ways:

You’d have been seen as a pioneer in website content writing As one of the first to establish yourself as a professional online content writer, you’d have been able to charge top dollar for your services You would have had such insight into writing online content that you could see easily where the Internet was headed and quickly adapt to position yourself as a specialist in the most lucrative online niches

Today’s blockchain and cryptocurrency industries are like the Internet of 1995, which is to say nascent and rife with opportunity.

Of course, with massive opportunity comes massive risk. So I’ll warn you that you should do your due diligence and study the market and the latest cryptocurrency news before jumping in. Still, I’m confident that the current market is a huge opportunity for freelance writers.

Get paid in cryptocurrency for freelance work

Want to get paid in cryptocurrency for freelance work? Chances are pretty good, your client will explain this up front. And there’s one big reason you should consider it: faster payments for international clients.

If you’re a freelancer in the U.S., and have a client outside the country, the current cross-border payments system doesn’t always work in your favor. Banks can take days to verify payment.

The cryptocurrency advantage: You can bill a freelance writing client in a foreign country and receive your payment within minutes with no intermediary. This is very valuable if you do a lot of business in foreign countries.

If you want to accept cryptocurrency as payment, there’s a few terms you’ll need to know:

Crypto wallet. To accept cryptocurrency as payment, you must have a crypto wallet. Think of it like a physical wallet designed for holding digital currencies like Bitcoin. And there’s more than one kind of crypto wallet depending on how you plan to use the funds from freelance work. If you’re just starting out, set up your crypto wallet with Coinbase.

And there’s more than one kind of crypto wallet depending on how you plan to use the funds from freelance work. If you’re just starting out, set up your crypto wallet with Coinbase. Content vesting. This involves accepting a native cryptocurrency for a project either as payment for services or as a reward for participation. For example, Steemit pays curation rewards for blog posts, comments, and upvotes. I’ve been active on the site since March 2018 and have earned hundreds of dollars in curation rewards. I’ve also accepted payment in STEEM for writing about cryptocurrency news, and then republished those articles at Trybe and Medium for additional rewards.

Is cryptocurrency a lucrative niche for freelance writers?

It is if you want to write for Fortune 500 companies about rapidly developing digital currencies.

For example, all the major global consulting companies—IBM, Accenture, Deloitte, Cisco, McKinsey, PwC, etc.—are spending billions of dollars on blockchain development. And the top companies in virtually every industry are testing distributed ledger and blockchain technology for all kinds of practical use cases.

There is no guarantee this testing will catapult the technology into the mainstream, but the current opportunity for freelance writers to cash in on this niche is significant.

Define your niche to reap rewards

In an emerging market or industry with billions in revenue potential, the cryptocurrency culture is also rife with scams. Some crypto exchanges have been hacked resulting in losses of millions of dollars in digital money.

But based on cryptocurrency news and trends, it appears this fin-tech niche will likely stabilize. And that means more great opportunities for freelance writers.

This is an industry still seeking its way, but now is a great time to dig in and establish yourself as the writer for cryptocurrency publications and copywriting clients.

With the total number of cryptocurrencies and digital assets on exchanges skyrocketing from 617 to 1,335 over the course of the year, 2017 has been dubbed the “year of the cryptocurrency.”[i] The market capitalization, investor appetite, and institutional coverage for cryptocurrencies have all jumped exponentially. This article will focus on the recent performance of the cryptocurrency industry, key factors driving and restraining growth, and its outlook over the next five years.

Industry Performance

Market Size & Volatility

Estimating the exact market size can be difficult of any industry, but particularly the cryptocurrency industry due to the massive volatility in prices over short periods of time. As of December 1, 2017, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market was $326.7B. By January 1 of this year, the cryptocurrency market cap had increased to $629.5B. At the writing of this article (February 28, 2018), the market cap settled at $447.9B.[ii]

Source: SIFR

The volatility of the crypto market spent all of 2017 above 80% annualized volatility level with a large portion of the year consistently above 100% volatility and peaking in February 2018 at 148% volatility.[iii] These extremely high levels are unheard for assets traded in volumes as high as cryptocurrencies in 2017. They are also especially high when compared to the rest of the US stock market, which in 2017 experienced one of the least volatile years on record.[iv]

Astronomical Growth Rates

In 2017, the cryptocurrency industry saw record-breaking growth rates in the number of market participants and market capitalization. The total number of cryptocurrencies and digital assets on exchanges soared by 216%, from 617 to 1,335, and currently stands at 1,531.[v][vi] Total market capitalization increased by 3,363% in 2017, with Bitcoin’s market cap jumping 1,364% and the Altcoin side shooting 16,695%.[vii] Altcoin describes all cryptocurrencies or digital assets other than Bitcoin.

Record growth in prices of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by capitalization during 2017 (USD), %.

The majority of analysts are bullish on the continued growth of the crypto market, although it is difficult to form any consensus about growth rates. Because of its vast application and advantages to traditional currencies, most analysts agree that the growth in the crypto market seen thus far is only the beginning of a long exponential curve.[viii] The highest estimates from bullish investors put the 2018 total market cap of crypto assets at $2T[ix], and the Bitcoin price at $1M by 2020.[x] More conservative estimates still predict a bitcoin price of $100,000 by 2022.[xi]

ICO’s

Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are a new kind of financial transaction, used to raise funds for a new cryptocurrency or other digital asset. Investors pay using cash or another cryptocurrency and are given a percentage of the new cryptocurrency in return. As cryptocurrencies become a more stable asset class, ICO’s are becoming a popular means of raising money and avoiding the arduous regulation surrounding the capital raising process.[xii]

In 2017, as the number of cryptocurrencies more than doubled, the ICO market saw equally historic activity levels. In total, over $6B was raised in more than 382 ICO’s over the course of the year, with June and December recording the highest individual months.[xiii] With the rising success and popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, this hot ICO market is one clear piece of evidence that investors have become willing and anxious to allocate more capital into this new asset class.

Market Share Concentration

This was also a transformative year in the cryptocurrency market in terms of market share concentration. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin held 87.4% of all capital invested in the crypto market. As its popularity came into the spotlight, and cryptocurrencies became more mainstream, over 914 new cryptocurrencies hit the market in 2017 alone. As a result, Bitcoin’s market share was reduced to 38.6% by year end.[xiv]

Growth Drivers

Economic Expansion

One unseen, but important factor in the rise of the cryptocurrency market is the recent economic expansion. Noting the history of cryptocurrencies – with blockchain and Bitcoin coming into existence in 2009 and Bitcoin’s subsequent upsurge after 2013 – it is easy to see that as market fears calmed after the 2008 recession, investors’ appetite for risk returned to pre-recession levels. And as the stock market experienced an almost all-time record year in 2017, investor confidence rode to historic highs as well – a perfect environment for the growth of a new type of risky investment asset.

Blockchain Technology

Blockchain has taken the technology world by storm with the rise of Bitcoin. Prior to the advent of blockchain technology, bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency world were virtually worthless. Blockchain technology is simply a ledger that holds a sequence of transactions that update automatically across a series of independent databases located in multiple geographic locations. This technology has profound implications for many industries but has already had rapid effects on the currency and financial technology space. The increased efficiency, decreased transaction costs, and heightened security that blockchain provides gives cryptocurrencies nearly all of their value. It allows for users to create unforgeable and verifiable transactions, while avoiding the digital fees usually enacted by banks for online transactions. IBISWorld reports an expected 7.3% increase over the next five years to 2022 in services conducted online in connection with advances in blockchain technology.[xv] Since its introduction in 2008, the value of cryptocurrencies has grown at astronomical rates, which explains the exuberance and entrance into reverse mergers for digital assets. That growth and the integration of blockchain the financial sector is expected to continue.

Investor Appetite

One of the major drivers of the growth seen in the crypto market has simply been a large increase in investor appetite. Over the course 2017, cryptocurrencies received a large amount of attention from investment and government institutions which legitimized them as investment assets. In February and April, Japan issued laws requiring cryptocurrencies to register with the financial services agency – a step towards the legalization of cryptocurrencies. In June, Goldman Sachs announced that due to popular demand, their markets division would begin covering Bitcoin. And at the end of October, the CME announced it would begin issuing Bitcoin derivatives.[xvi] All of these events, among others, showcase the pent up investor demand for cryptocurrencies.

Attractive Investment Features

Decentralized: Monetary policy dictated by central banks can cause devaluation of centralized currencies. Whereas cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any government and therefore are not subject to the will of central banks and are only controlled by market dynamics.

Secure: Cryptocurrencies are, by definition, secure. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology allows for unforgeable, verifiable transactions to take place across several geographic locations. This calms many of the fears critics have raised for the past decade about cryptocurrencies.

Completely Digital: Because cryptocurrencies are completely virtual, there are practically no transportation costs whatsoever, nor transaction costs. Whereas even online banks may charge for transaction fees, the digital nature of cryptocurrencies significantly decreases the cost of digital transactions.

Growth in Value: With the rise of technology capable of using cryptocurrencies, the market has shown that there is a large desire for digital currencies. As a result, cryptocurrencies have a become a valuable method for holding and appreciating wealth.

Untapped Uses: Investors are seeing that this is only the beginning of the upturn for cryptocurrencies. There are several applications that are either beginning to be or that have yet to be explored. These include smart contracts, ESOP’s, capital raising and more.

Growth Restraints

Regulation

Regulator treatment of cryptocurrencies is not yet completely decided, however uncertainty over the future regulations to be placed on the investing and trading in the crypto market is a major limit on growth. In fact, a lack of regulatory oversight scares many would-be investors away and lends to the stereotype that cryptocurrencies are used only by gangs and criminals looking to launder money. Many investors are nervous that governments are looking to completely ban the use of cryptocurrencies as has already taken place in some countries.[xvii] Additionally, as regulators around the world have seen the appreciation in the crypto market and hope to capitalize on its growth, questions have been raised about the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies.[xviii] This year, the SEC disapproved of a Bitcoin ETF and declared tokens were “securities” thereby restricting their legal use to that of a normal security. Later in the year, the Chinese Central Bank declared that ICO’s were illegal.[xix] The crypto market has proven to be even more sensitive to news on regulation and government treatment than traditional stock exchanges. This trend of sensitivity, combined with continued uncertainty, will curb growth as much of the developed world is still trying to understand and institutionalize cryptocurrencies.

Volatility

As previously noted, the crypto market has seen extreme levels of volatility over the course of its ascension. Although certain investors would view this trend positively, there is a large portion of the world’s capital that is off-limits to cryptocurrencies because of their high volatility. Cryptocurrencies are so volatile for many reasons including:

No Intrinsic Value

Lack of Regulatory Oversight

Lack of Institutional Capital

Thin Order Books

Many of these are characteristic of immature markets and should be resolved over the course of the next decade as the market ages. But until these issues are solidified, volatility will continue to reign.

Cybercrime

Lastly, the growth of the cryptocurrency market is limited to the degree to which it can assure investors that their money will be safe. This seems to be traditional investing logic, but with the novel nature of cryptocurrencies, investors are especially cautious about the safety of their capital. Despite the security provided by blockchain technology, the crypto world is still completely digital and therefore prone to cyber-attacks. This has already occurred several times over the past 5 years with hundreds of millions of dollars being stolen by hackers.[xx]

Outlook

The cryptocurrency market appears to be a fixture of a new era of investing. Because of the plethora of new technologies that it employs and its applications in the several industries, cryptocurrencies are expected to continue to grow and eventually stabilize. Volatility will gradually subside over the coming decade as more regulation, a greater diversity of investors, and improved security measures enter the market.[xxi] Because of this, there will be a continued flow of capital into the crypto market as long term investors begin to invest and build a solid foundation for long term market growth.

2018-10-23 19:34:06+00:00	China & Blockchain Part 2 : The World’s Most Undervalued Market	['Radigan Carter']	"Imagine if Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google had just gone public. You were a programmer building the platform — but you couldn’t own any shares.

That is exactly what is happening in China today.

Mr. David Li, the founder of Trinity recently explained on an AMA an interesting difference on how blockchain projects are valued between China and the West.

“For the Chinese who are working on blockchain projects, the price of the underlying project means nothing to them — since they can’t own it. They are focused solely on the tech.”

Thinking about the significance of that statement, I looked at the current daily trading volume for bitcoin to Chinese Yuan (BTCCNY).

The Chinese Yuan accounted for only 0.79% in daily trade volume to bitcoin.

Interesting.

When was the last time the Chinese public had a straight forward onramp from Yuan to bitcoin anyway?

December 2013. Almost 5 years ago.

China stopped mainstream financial institutions on the mainland from dealing with bitcoin in December 2013, when the overall market cap for all cryptocurrencies was only $15.7 billion U.S.

Logarithmic chart from 2013 to Present — Total Cryptocurrency Market Cap

Closer look at May 2013 to December 2013 market capitalization

The last time there was direct Chinese participation, the total market capitalization went up 881% in 6 months.

Since then, almost 5 years, the market has risen 1310% without the Chinese having a direct path to market participation.

That is a lot of pent up demand.

Imagine working in Shenzhen, seeing the market go up over 1300% while you are programming a blockchain project — and you can’t legally own any of it.

But that still doesn’t paint the entire picture.

The other part to remember is the difference in projects which made up the market in December 2013 at $15.7 billion compared to today, at $221 billion.

It’s a different world.

Here are the Top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap in December 2013. I pulled this off archived pages from www.coinmarketcap.com

Some of these projects no longer exist from five years ago.

Today is a very different picture where the projects in scale and function go well beyond the scope of most projects in the Top 25 in 2013.

In fact, just the four Chinese projects below in today’s Top 25 by market cap would have equaled 44% of the entire market capitalization of all blockchain projects in 2013.

#13 Tron — $1.4 billion

#14 NEO — $1.2 billion

#16 Binance — $1.1 billion

#19 VeChain — $719 million

With China not having a direct route to cryptocurrency markets and western institutional investors not in the Chinese blockchain space yet, these current valuations are based mostly on western individual buyers.

The next questions then are:

If China has no direct route to buy any of the projects they are currently working on, are they really even accurately valued at current prices?

Would China want their projects to be accurately valued before the Chinese had a chance to buy their own projects?

How is it possible to gauge current western institutional involvement in the Chinese blockchain space?

The impact on the value of Chinese projects when the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has their own cryptocurrency in place.

Yesterday, it was reported “Bank of Communications (BoCom) a Chinese state-owned commerical bank has issued RMB9.3 billion (US $1.3 billion) of residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) through its proprietary blockchain network, Jucai Chain.”

China is getting closer to issuing a Chinese sovereign cryptocurrency. That day is coming.

President XI is calling blockchain a breakthrough technology , the PBoC have filed for 41 blockchain patents this year, and China State Television say blockchain will be worth 10x more than the internet , estimated at $34 Trillion U.S. dollars.

The Digital Currency Research Lab (DCRL), the research wing of the People’s Bank of China, is the organization furiously filing blockchain patents.

From a report in November 2017, the DCRL said:

“ — it’s inevitable for the central bank to launch its own digital currency to upscale the existing circulation of the fiat currency.”

When that happens, we will see China reopen exchanges on the mainland.

But it won’t be a bitcoin to Chinese Yuan pair.

It will be a — for lack of a better term —a CryptoYuan, paired not just to bitcoin, but to most other Chinese blockchain projects as well.

Similar in function to tether pairings currently, but fully backed by the PBoC and stable in value to the Yuan.

Where Chinese can transfer CryptoYuan direct from their bank accounts to an exchange and buy projects through the direct pairing.

In essence, the Chinese government is signaling their intent of competing directly with stable coins like Tether and cutting out BTC completely as a reserve cryptocurrency, all while maintaining control of their own money supply.

By launching a CryptoYuan, controlled by the People’s Bank of China, this will align the interests of the government, banks, and people simultaneously.

It will give the Chinese government the taxing mechanism that they need through financial transaction transparency. They will not be relying on people to self report like what is currently happening in the West.

Think of it like a 1099 from a brokerage account. The person gets a copy for their records, as does the taxing authority for the Chinese government, but it’s on the blockchain and immutable.

Also, this will not be unique to the Chinese government. The West will eventually follow as taxation through transaction transparency is a driving factor for countries with record low, or negative interest rates as they all seek maximum tax revenues available.

It is the reason the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) has been adopted by most major economies in the world through the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to determine which country has taxing jurisdiction over assets without relying on the owner to self report.

A Chinese sovereign currency will also give the Chinese banks a secured place in the new Chinese blockchain future. The banks will be running the nodes for the blockchain, tracking the transactions from CrpytoYuan to digital assets and back in all accounts.

Notice how you never hear so much as one Chinese banker ever say a bad word about blockchain?

Compare that to the West, where every week it seems like a different banker is on CNBC espousing his personal views on why blockchain will never work and cryptocurrencies are a terrible idea.

Not in China.

The only person that occasionally speaks is the PBoC Director and when he does, all he says about blockchain is “the blockchain belongs to the public and serves the public interest.”

And he calls bitcoin “inspiring”, saying it gives “ordinary people (the) freedom to participate.”

The PBoC sets the tone for the entire financial sector in China.

The silence from the rest of the bankers in China is deafening.

They know their government is putting the pieces in place for their entire country to participate and they will play a key role. They don’t have to say anything.

A sovereign cryptocurrency will give the Chinese people a direct link to their bank accounts to buy blockchain projects.

We will see what the final product looks like when it launches, but if it is what the government is hinting at, China will actually have a more frictionless way to buy blockchain projects and cryptocurrencies than the West.

The Western Disconnect in the Way Chinese Blockchain Projects are Viewed

Global Coin Research recently wrote a fascinating article describing the difference in mindset between Chinese market participants vs western market participants.

Market participants in China know there are bad actors and fraud to watch out for in all markets, cryptocurrencies and blockchain included.

For most western investors, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are their first taste of what an unregulated market feels like.

For individual investors in the blockchain space, we willingly accept this is the digital frontier and know there is no safety out here.

Win or lose, it is completely on us.

There is no regulatory body coming to save us. No bank to call when we send funds to the wrong address on the blockchain or lose a private key.

But for institutional investors, all of that sound terrible, and being comfortable with it completely insane.

In the last two to three years we have seen institutional money start to make forays into the western blockchain space.

But it has been completely safe expeditions.

A long only bitcoin fund.

Possibly buying tokens at steep discounts before the project launches to the public.

Buying a percentage of platforms or exchanges with known entities from previous deals in traditional markets.

Why?

Think about the makeup of the investors who are in these institutional funds. The smallest Limited Partner (LP) allowed in these funds are Accredited Investors who have $1 million liquid net worth. There are different opportunities and rules when these investors hit the $5 million and $10 million mark depending on the fund.

The average age of a millionaire in the U.S. is 59 years old, almost perfectly in the middle of the baby boomer generation in America which is the massive aging population born between 1946–1964.

Talk to most baby boomers. What do they have to say about bitcoin, let alone the blockchain or other cryptocurrency projects?

How about investing in China?

If they have an opinion, far and wide, it is mostly negative on both accounts.

This mindset is what institutional Fund Managers are up against when they bring blockchain deals to their LP’s to invest in.

Chinese markets and Cryptocurrencies combine their clients worst fears.

If the millionaire baby boomer isn’t comfortable with the deal, they won’t invest. If they don’t invest, the fund doesn’t make money.

So the fund managers have stayed with the majority of western projects and traditional type venture investing in the space so far in order to close deals and keep the funds viable.

This is the greatest strategic advantage to the individual investor currently available, but will not last forever.

Eventually the fund managers will have the right connections in China to convince their baby boomer clients to invest in Chinese blockchain deals.

Just look at Global Coin Research’s twitter followers. Venture Capitalists and Institutional Investors reading the same research individual investors are — all looking for an edge in news which is not usually translated to english.

This is not by accident.

China is the only level playing field currently for western individual investors competing at the same price point as institutional investors for projects — for now.

The Dragon Awakens

There is a lot of action currently behind the scenes in the West as institutions prepare custody solutions to allow institutional money from endowments, hedge funds, state pension funds, etc. to join us brave privateers that beat them to this New World of cryptocurrency and blockchain.

Bakkt even announced yesterday their first contracts for BTC in November will be a one to one ratio.

All this is bullish.

But the real news has not been announced yet.

China launching the first sovereign cryptocurrency in the world and reopens exchanges so their country can participate.

When that happens we’ll see how high this dragon can go with five years of pent up demand and the largest middle class in the world reentering the cryptocurrency market.

And this time, it will be with the full support of the Chinese government.

Combine that with institutional money eventually flowing into Chinese blockchain projects and we’ll see Chinese projects accurately valued for the first time since they launched.

We will also see if this is when the West wakes up to the fact they are losing the blockchain race.

Whether China launching the CryptoYuan and reopening exchanges is the 21st century Sputnik moment the West needs to spur them into action remains to be seen.

None of this is financial advice. I only know I cannot accurately value any Chinese projects until the PBoC Director lets China participate again.

See you there. — Radigan"
