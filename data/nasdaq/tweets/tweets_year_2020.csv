That’s something we’ll answer in part two, as well as discuss potential fixes and why a little adversarial pressure might be good to harden the network's defense. ⌛️"

1726	2020-10-27 15:36:30+00:00	CoinDesk	"4. Another attack that requires incomplete transaction data: the pinning attack.

1727	2020-10-27 15:36:28+00:00	CoinDesk	"3. The time-dilation attack, the most complex and serious of the bunch, requires a “sybil attack” on a victim’s Lightning node.

With the node’s connections “eclipsed,” the attacker can feed it transaction data at a slower rate in hopes of stealing funds from closing LN channels. https://t.co/mgLm6rzgIl"
1728	2020-10-27 15:36:27+00:00	CoinDesk	2. For a “flood and loot” attack, an attacker would spam routed payments through a victim’s node and force close each channel together. If any of the closing transactions failed when broadcasted on-chain, the attacker could claim them by re-sending the same BTC with a higher fee. https://t.co/zlI0ToKZA2
1729	2020-10-27 15:36:25+00:00	CoinDesk	"1. “Griefing” attacks have been possible since Lightning's launch and involve freezing the funds in a payment channel by maxing out its HTLC limit.
 
Relative to other Lightning vulnerabilities, griefing isn’t as threatening as attackers can only freeze funds, not steal them. https://t.co/fQl0V7pKDj"
