He Began Writing About Blockchain Technology In He Has Managed Numerous Crypto-Related Projects', 'Is Passionate About All Things Blockchain.']	"The price of bitcoin has jumped to a weekly high of nearly $45,000 amid positive news coming from the US Fed Chair – Jerome Powell. Most alternative coins have also marked substantial daily gains, with ETH rising above $3,100 and BNB jumping to $400.

Bitcoin Eyes $45K

The tides seemed to have turned in the cryptocurrency space in the past 24 hours. On Wednesday, bitcoin had dumped below $41,000 for the third time since the start of the week, and the situation looked grim at best.

However, the bulls managed to intercept this drop just like the previous ones and pushed the asset north. As reported yesterday, this resulted in BTC exceeding $43,000.

The cryptocurrency even attempted to break above $44,000 but was initially stopped. However, BTC shot up in the hours after and neared $45,000. This came shortly after the US Federal Reserve Chairman – Jerome Powell – said during a two-hour House Finance Services Committee meeting that the country has no intentions to ban cryptocurrencies.

As a result, bitcoin spiked to its current level, which is the highest it has been in a week. Consequently, its market capitalization has increased to $850 billion.

Alts See Nothing But Green

Most larger-cap alternative coins remained stagnant in the past few days. This is not the case now, though. Ethereum had fallen to $2,900 and struggled to reclaim $3,000. However, a 5% daily increase has driven the second-largest cryptocurrency to above $3,100 as of now.

Cardano also dipped hard during the week but currently stands at $2.15 after a 4.5% jump. Binance Coin, which was the best performer yesterday, continues to impress again with an 8.5% increase to over $400.

Ripple (4.5%), Solana (6%), Polkadot (7.5%), Dogecoin (3%), Terra (11%), Avalanche (1.5%), Uniswap (9.5%), and Chainlink (6%) are also well in the green.

Further gains are evident from OMG Network (23%), VeChain (21%), Qtum (19%), Tezos (15%), IOTA (11%), THORChain (11%), AMP (11%), Arweave (11%), and ICON (10%).

The cryptocurrency market cap has increased by roughly $100 billion and is just shy of $2 trillion."

Bitcoin and Crypto Market Watch

The global cryptocurrency market continued to grow this week to levels previously seen in May 2021 with the market cap crossing $2.4 trillion. Bitcoin rallied by 8% in the last 7 days to within touching distance of $60,000 today. It is currently trading near $59,400 as of 5 pm IST today. Bitcoin’s dominance of the market has steadily climbed to 46% over the past few weeks as reports of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granting approval to the Bitcoin Futures ETF this month continues to lift market sentiment.

In this article, we will track other stories that drove adoption in the crypto market this week.

Governments explore digital currencies

G7 finance leaders recently have set out 13 guiding principles for retail central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to support policy and design deliberations within and beyond the group. G7 is an inter-governmental political forum comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In this context, blockchain companies Ripple (ticker XRP) and Avalanche (ticker AVAX) have joined an independent group to support the development of a digital UK pound.

Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, has expressed support for cryptocurrencies as a means of payment although he remained skeptical of its use for oil contracts. Russia ruled out a blanket ban on crypto trading similar to China.

Investment firms see potential in crypto-based companies

Moonpay, a crypto fintech startup that allows the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies and digital assets using debit, credit cards and local bank transfers, has reportedly raised $400 million in its first round of funding led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management.

Crypto lending firm Celsius network has raised $400 million in a new equity funding round led by Canada’s second largest-pension fund CDPQ and WestCap, an equity firm.

More synergies between crypto and fiat emerge

Bakkt, a US cryptocurrency marketplace, has partnered with Google to allow its debit card users to purchase goods and services using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the Google Pay wallet.

Strike, a payments company responsible for the Bitcoin tipping feature on Twitter, has released a new product feature called “Pay me in Bitcoin” which allows anyone to convert a portion of their income into Bitcoin with no fees.

With Bitcoin heading towards its all-time high in the near future, more institutional capital and strong retail participation is expected in the upcoming months.

Redman Has Been An Active Member Of The Cryptocurrency Community Since He Has A Passion For Bitcoin', 'Open-Source Code', 'Decentralized Applications. Since September', 'Redman Has Written More Than Articles For Bitcoin.Com News About The Disruptive Protocols Emerging Today.']	"Top Ten Crypto Market Capitalizations Shifted a Great Deal Since the Last Time BTC Hit $60K

The price of bitcoin recently jumped above the $60,000 per unit mark on October 15, and the leading crypto asset has not seen prices this high since mid-April six months ago. However, as far as the top digital assets are concerned, in terms of market capitalization, things are a whole lot different. For instance, ether tokens are worth a lot more than they were six months ago and binance coin values were higher back then than they are today.

Six Months Later as Bitcoin Returns to $60K, Some Crypto Coins Trade for More Value, While Others Trade for Less

On April 11, 2021, statistics from coinmarketcap.com’s historical snapshot data show that on that day, bitcoin (BTC) exchanged hands for $60,204 per unit. BTC also reached an all-time high three days later on Apr 14, 2021, at $64,804 per coin that week. The data from the historical snapshot indicates that ethereum (ETH) was swapping for $2,157 per coin on April 11 and today, a single ether is trading for $3,761 per unit.

The stats six months ago show binance coin (BNB) held the third position six months ago and at the time each BNB traded for $525. Prices are a bit lower than they were back then and BNB lost the third position to cardano (ADA) for a few months. Today, metrics show that BNB is swapping for $480 per coin which is 9.375% lower than the price six months ago. At that time, XRP held the fourth position in terms of market cap but today, XRP has slid to the sixth position.

The stablecoin tether (USDT) held the fifth spot back then, today it is sitting at number four. Like ethereum (ETH), cardano (ADA) is another coin that was trading for lower prices on April 11. At the time, ADA exchanged hands for $1.27 per coin and on October 18, ADA trades for $2.12 per unit. Polkadot (DOT) held the seventh position trading for $41.42 per DOT six months ago, today DOT trades for a touch lower at $40.76 and sits in the eighth largest position.

Litecoin, Uniswap, Chainlink Bumped Out of the Top 10 — Theta, Filecoin, Tron, Vechain Slip Out of the Top 20

Litecoin (LTC), uniswap (UNI), and chainlink (LINK) held the last three positions in the top ten respectively. But none of these coins are in the top ten positions anymore and UNI is the closest today. Positioned at 14 today, UNI is trading for $25.39 but on April 11, the token changed hands for $29.98. LTC was holding the eighth largest market valuation six months ago, but today it has slid to the 16th largest. LTC exchanged hands for $253.63 and today its much lower at $185.22.

Chainlink (LINK) was swapping hands for $33.92 per LINK back then, but on October 18, the price is around $25.59. LINK at that time held the tenth-largest spot and it now holds the 18th position. Missing from the top 20 coins that were seen on the list back then include tokens like theta (THETA) filecoin (FIL), tron (TRON) and vechain (VET). One notable gainer is solana (SOL) which moved from the 20th top position to the crypto economy’s seventh-largest spot in terms of valuation.

What do you think about the top ten crypto coin shift and some of the crypto assets that were bumped out of the top ten and twenty market positions during the last six months?

2021-10-04 02:17:12+00:00	Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin gains, ether, cardano slip. Latest rates here	[]	"Cryptocurrency prices today were mixed with Bitcoin trading below $48,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped by about $2,500 within a matter of minutes on Friday and was trading around $48,000 for most of the weekend, having spent more than a week before that in the lower $40,000s.

Bitcoin prices today were marginally higher at $47,946. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 65% this year (year-to-date), and much below its record of near $65,000 it had hit in April.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, plunged over 1% to $3,378. Cardano prices also fell to $2.22 whereas dogecoin rose marginally to $0.22. The performance of other digital tokens including XRP, Litecoin, Stellar were also mixed over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin rose on Friday to its highest level since around mid-September, bolstered in part by seasonal factors as well as supportive comments overall from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday.

Bitcoin was hit on multiple fronts in September, including a botched roll-out of the coin as legal tender in El Salvador and tightening of regulatory oversights in the US and China. It delivered a negative return for the fifth straight year for the 30-day period last month. The crypto asset has been on a losing streak in terms of monthly performance in September since 2017.

China's central bank had said all financial transactions involving cryptocurrencies are illegal, sounding the death knell for the digital trade in the country after a crackdown on the volatile digital tokens.

China has been tightening its crackdown on cryptocurrencies, and its efforts to restrain the trading and mining are adding to the wild moves in bitcoin and other markets, which are already down hard from records set earlier this year.

2021-10-22 02:13:53+00:00	Bitcoin falls from record high, ether, other cryptos also plunge. Check cryptocurrency prices today	[]	"Cryptocurrency prices plunged today as Bitcoin declined from its all-time high it had hit two days ago after the debut of the first US bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund. The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading 4% lower at $62,740.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, was down over 2% to $4,112, as per CoinDesk. Cardano prices fell nearly 3% to $2.16 whereas dogecoin also slipped 3% to $0.24. Other digital tokens like Shiba Inu, Binance Coin, Litecoin, Uniswap, XRP were also trading with cuts over the last 24 hours, though, Solana was up over 10%.

Bitcoin on Wednesday rallied to a record high of $66,974, the recent rally came after six-months from its previous top of $64,895, fueled by the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Investors have bet the long-awaited launch of bitcoin ETFs will lead to greater investment from both retail and institutional investors.

Yet analysts at JPMorgan voiced doubt over how long-lasting the boost to bitcoin's price from the ProShares ETF, which trades under the ticker BITO, would be. ""Will the launch of BITO by itself bring significantly more fresh capital into bitcoin? We doubt it given the multitude of investment choices bitcoin investors already have,"" they wrote in a note, as reported by Reuters.

The ETF doesn’t invest directly in Bitcoin. It instead invests in the futures market tied to Bitcoin. Someone with an old-school brokerage account can buy the ETF, for example, without having to open a trading account for crypto.

2021-09-29 19:25:30+00:00	Regulating the unregulated cryptocurrency market	['Christina Pazzanese', 'Harvard Staff Writer']	"Is cryptocurrency the future of global banking and trade, or a sketchy payment and investment vehicle favored by scammers and speculators, criminal organizations, and any individual or entity shut out of Western banking systems, like North Korea?

The jury is still out. One thing that is clear, however, is that the cryptocurrency market continues to grow as its popularity has become more mainstream since 2019. Even many once-skeptical institutional investors have come around after seeing some of the mind-boggling returns. In January 2019, one Bitcoin traded for $3,441; this week, it hit $43,136.

But that success may have a price. Calls to rein in the industry are at fever pitch. This month China, one of the world’s largest digital currency markets, outlawed all crypto-related transactions. It banned trading them in 2019. The U.S. Treasury said this week it will sanction a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time for facilitating ransomware payments. New tax and trading rules for the industry are included in legislation Congress is scheduled to vote on by week’s end. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also pushing for greater enforcement. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler called cryptocurrency an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse” and said investors don’t have enough regulatory protection from the swarms jumping into crypto finance, issuance, trading, and lending.

Q&A

Scott Duke Kominers

GAZETTE: There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, but no consensus on the precise number. The range is between 5,000 and 12,000, valued at about $2 trillion. What does the landscape look like today?

KOMINERS: Those numbers sound huge, but there are actually many, many more than that because lots of crypto products are not currencies and lots of cryptocurrencies are too small to be part of mainstream exchanges. Many crypto products are effectively just tokens. Sometimes these are representative of ownership in decentralized autonomous organizations, which are organizations that share governance rights and returns to a committee of participants by allocating them tokens — a bit like stock shares. There are project-specific tokens used in specific online games or among individual communities. There are NFTs, which are unique non-fungible tokens that have been used as representing ownership over things like digital artworks. Tons of these are being minted daily at this point. So, there is a very large landscape. The pure currency aspect of it is a huge market on its own, but a drop in the bucket of the total applications of crypto and blockchain technology today.

GAZETTE: What’s the appeal for investors? Is it just the eye-popping returns or is there more to it?

KOMINERS: Some people have gotten interested in cryptocurrency because of the investment returns, unquestionably. But there are also real, practical infrastructure and technology benefits. You’re starting to see countries willing to receive officially recognized crypto payments. And people have been considering whether crypto technology can be used to deliver government aid. This is because when it’s working, crypto is frictionless, and thus creates a much more efficient way of transferring and sharing value among people. And, as a result, there’s a real opportunity to use crypto for large-scale payments, as well as in things like small business payment processing. Also, there’s a big opportunity for enhancing financial inclusion, by providing secure payment networks and cross-border transfers in places that don’t otherwise have well-structured consumer financial systems. So, while some people are interested in this for the short- or medium-term investment opportunity, I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.

GAZETTE: The SEC chairman called this an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.” Is this industry operating in a rule-free, “Wild West” atmosphere, as he suggested?

KOMINERS: I haven’t read the full Gensler remarks, so I can’t comment explicitly on his overall take, but I can comment on some of the individual elements you mention. It’s clear that this space needs much more consumer protection, and we’re starting to see that. Right now, if a hacker gains access to your crypto wallet, they can drain it and you may have no recourse. But the newer waves of wallet technologies and crypto exchanges are thinking hard about all the things consumers expect out of banking products and equities trading accounts. They’re trying to create more security and protections at the consumer-interface level. And then, of course, you also need regulation to prevent financial crime and scams, just like we have in other parts of the financial-services industry.

GAZETTE: Some lawmakers have pointed to the GameStop stock trading frenzy in early 2021 as analogous to the crypto market, saying that most ordinary investors have gotten caught up in hype and don’t fully understand the risks they’re taking.

“I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.”

KOMINERS: First of all, it’s important to note that the GameStop run-up wasn’t in a new trading arena — it was Internet-hyped trading of a specific stock in the regular stock market. That said, the GameStop story is in some sense analogous to the meme trading of crypto products like Dogecoin — there’s consumer confusion around the idea that these assets could lose value. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the GameStop and Dogecoin run-ups and crashes. They were on a platform that made trading feel like a video game, and didn’t understand the real risks. And so in those ways, it’s analogous. Consumers and investors need to understand that these are high variance, speculative assets.

But when you get to the technology infrastructure pieces, GameStop and crypto can look very different. Cryptocurrency trading now looks a lot like equities trading — you have a brokerage account at an exchange, or potentially on a platform like Robinhood. But for many of the other crypto applications, the infrastructure is very, very new, and the platforms are very, very new, and they’re not heavily protected.

I think we’ll see more regulation around messaging and communication, but there are also more structural questions. For example, one of the regulatory conversations is around stablecoins — crypto assets that hold nominally fixed values because they’re designed to just be used for moving money from one place to another in a fixed denomination. They’re typically backed by reserves in a way similar to how banks back their loans with deposits. But there are questions about how to properly structure those reserves. If everyone simultaneously decided they wanted to divest, will stablecoins have the reserves to support that? I expect to see regulation around allowable assets and reserve design — just like we have with banks.

And finally, we’ll need regulation to ensure open competition among different crypto products and platforms.

GAZETTE: Besides fending off regulations, what are the industry’s other challenges?

KOMINERS: One basic challenge is around taxation of crypto income. This isn’t just about tax avoidance concerns — a lot of people would like to pay taxes on their crypto but have absolutely no idea how to do so. We don’t have clear crypto categories for taxation purposes, so it’s extremely complicated to figure out which parts are ordinary income versus capital gains, as well as when the associated income has accrued. Organizing the tax treatment of all these assets — and then, of course, ensuring tax payment — is essential.

Another challenge is environmental: A lot of the most popular crypto technologies at the moment require tremendous amounts of energy to run. And so, we’re going to start seeing government leadership and regulation driving a shift toward versions of this technology that are more environmentally sustainable.

Bitcoin and other early blockchains use a technology where you have to prove that you solved a very hard computational problem to record transactions securely. And solving those computational problems is taking up absurd amounts of energy. Newer blockchains use much less energy-intensive ways of validating transactions. And so, my guess and hope is that the way we’re going to get away from environmentally harmful cryptocurrency transactions is through continual improvements in the technology, alongside regulation and market forces pushing toward technologies that are much more efficient.

GAZETTE: If new regulations are on the way, what would be the best- or worst-case scenarios for the industry?

KOMINERS: I don’t think it’s a question of ‘no regulation’ versus ‘a lot.’ The real question is the extent to which regulators understand that crypto is a different type of product and tech infrastructure from anything they’ve regulated before. The worst case would be to just treat it like historical financial products or like historical tech platforms without thinking about the ways in which crypto differs, both in terms of its use cases and in terms of its underlying technology."

2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin bounces back above $55,000, but trader has his eye on two other cryptocurrencies	['Keris Lahiff']	"Bitcoin just made a major comeback.

The cryptocurrency rallied on Wednesday, topping $55,000 and hitting its highest level since mid-May. Regulatory fears have eased this week after both Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and SEC chair Gary Gensler said they have no plans to impose restrictions on cryptocurrency trading.

Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, had a plan over the summer to beef up his position in bitcoin as its price plummeted – re-entering at $32,000 and adding to it if it fell to as low as $20,000.

""It didn't get there. I didn't get my full position on but what that ultimately did is it got me doing more research and trying to find where else could I invest this money that I want to be in crypto,"" Baruch told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Wednesday.

Baruch highlights two cryptocurrencies he is getting behind as an alternative to bitcoin – Solana and Algorand.

""Solana is actually my highest holding right now, got in that at a good time and that has risen pretty sharply. I think that has legs to go as well from here... and Algorand to me feels like Solana two to three years ago,"" he said.

Algorand looks constructive on the charts, he continues. Baruch says it looks to be a buy so long as it holds above $1.50. It traded at $1.82 on Wednesday."
2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin jumps to nearly 5-month high, topping $55,000 on Wednesday	['Tanaya Macheel']	"Bitcoin jumped to a nearly five-month high above $55,000 on Wednesday, extending its rally from the previous day as institutions jumped in to try to catch the wave.

The cryptocurrency traded 7.6% higher at $54,873.02, according to Coin Metrics. Ether also rose 2.8% to $3,575.73.

Bitcoin rose as high as $55,499 earlier in the session. It's up 13% this week alone and 87% for the year.

The rally comes amid a series of small developments in Washington, D.C. that have provided some comfort to institutional investors keen to jump into cryptocurrencies.

""Regulatory uncertainty is what's still keeping investors out of the market and every time we get a step closer to regulatory clarity, you see this kind of reaction,"" Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matt Hougan said. ""It's the primary driver of next great bull market in crypto.""

According to financial advisors surveyed by Bitwise, the number one thing preventing them from making allocations to crypto is regulatory uncertainty. Hougan said the majority result has been the same three years in a row.

On Tuesday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said in a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee that he has no plans to ban cryptocurrency, and that a ban would be up to Congress.

Gensler's comments mirror those made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who also said Friday he has no plans to ban cryptocurrencies.

""You had every major regulatory agency in the U.S. this summer declaring that they needed to create a new regulatory regime around crypto,"" Hougan added. ""That created a great deal of uncertainty in investors minds, they were hesitant to allocate not knowing what the range of possibilities would be. The reason we're rallying this week is that most extreme left tail of following the path of China was wiped from the market by both Jerome Powell and Gary Gensler.""

Herd mentality

Genesis head of market insights Noelle Acheson said Wednesday's price action is different from previous ones this year and that all signs point to it being institutionally driven.

""Institutional investors move as a herd, they are momentum chasers,"" she said. ""When they see this kind of momentum, they start to think, what am I going to miss? Is my performance going to be weaker than those of my competitors? Maybe I should pile into that.""

She noted that Bitcoin has maintained its rank in the top five performing digital assets over the past 24 hours. That's something Acheson had never ever seen before, as top performers are usually smaller altcoins and DeFi assets. Bitcoin is the institutional onramp to crypto, and when it's one of the top performers, it's a sign the institutions are coming, Acheson said.

She added that with a sharp price jump, there tend to be several short positions that get liquidated, but that wasn't the case Wednesday.

""At one stage that price jumped 3.5% in a five-minute window, and without the liquidations, that says that that is big spot buying,"" Acheson said.

Another big signal came from the CME.

On Wednesday, it had the highest basis spread — the difference between bitcoin futures prices and the spot price — of any of the exchanges, Acheson said. She called it ""unusual"" because the CME basis normally trails that of the other exchanges. She added that CME is the exchange that offers the lowest leverage, so while it may not be the one used by traders or hedge funds that want leverage, it's the one traditional institutions often choose to use because it's currently the only crypto derivatives exchange with federal oversight.

The macro backdrop

At the same time, stocks were falling as concerns about rising rates, higher inflation, the state of the reopening and the debt limit dented investor sentiment. Bitcoin hasn't proven itself to be a safe-haven asset — its price has tanked with the stock market several times before — but many still see it that way and it was holding up amid Wednesday's equity market turmoil.

""The Janet Yellen discussion yesterday was a major reason to buy bitcoin,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday morning on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""If you parse what she's saying and it becomes true, the dollar doesn't seem to be as valuable as crypto.""

Yellen warned on Tuesday that inflationary pressures hitting the U.S. economy could last for several months and that the U.S. should fully expect a recession if the debt limit isn't lifted within two weeks.

""Thus far we've seen cryptos behave as a hybrid somewhere between a commodity and a currency,"" Morgan Stanley Wealth Management chief investment officer Lisa Shalett told ""Squawk on the Street."" So the ""volatility has been 4x that of stocks."""
2021-10-07 00:00:00+00:00	A Young Crypto With Big Potential	[]	"Long-term, regular readers of my musings will know that I was an early, enthusiastic supporter of Bitcoin (BTC). Far from seeing it as some kind of con trick or Ponzi scheme as some prominent bankers and pundits did when BTC/USD was at around $250, I recognized the potential real-world applications of not just Bitcoin but, more importantly, the blockchain concept as a whole.

Recently, however, I have gone somewhat quiet on the subject. Once the whole world knew what Bitcoin was and where its potential lie, and after BTC/USD jumped to around $50,000, there was no room for evangelicals such as myself. There are only so many times you can say “I told you so” to the early doubters, many of whom now talk about Bitcoin as if they had always been bullish.

Since those early days, of course, there have been countless other cryptos launched. Some that attempt to represent value only as a currency, face the problem of competing directly with the name recognition and acceptance of Bitcoin, but others that have focused more on the practical uses of blockchain technology have emerged and thrived. The most notable of those is Ethereum (ETH), and its token, ether.

If value is derived from name recognition and speculative value, as is the case now with Bitcoin and some other altcoins, there is little room for improvement on the basic concept, so challenging the established leader in the field is extremely difficult. When it comes to something like ether where the blockchain is used to facilitate transactions, on the other hand, there is always the danger that a better mousetrap will come along. In that case, the early adoption advantage of something like Bitcoin or Ethereum doesn’t apply. In fact, being a late entrant when the problems of the early entrants into the market are known has significant advantages.

That is why, right now, I am interested in Algorand.

Algorand has an impressive bloodline, having been developed in part by the MIT professor and Turing Prize winner Silvio Micali primarily as a platform to enable smart contracts. It has been around since 2019 and solves some of the problems that have become apparent with Ethereum and to some extent with Bitcoin. Transaction costs and costs of entry are lower with Algorand than with Ethereum, and the use of “pure-proof-of-stake” rather than Bitcoin’s “proof of work” means that it requires less computing power and therefore less energy consumption that the granddaddy of cryptos.

As you might expect with a nascent crypto, ALGO, the token associated with Algorand, has shown a lot of volatility since its launch.

It is currently trading not far off its all-time highs, but as early investors in Bitcoin will tell you, new highs at low absolute values for a crypto aren’t necessarily a reason to hold off. I am not saying it will happen, of course, but there is a chance that Algorand could emerge as the dominant platform for decentralized finance, known as “DeFi”, and if that were to happen, ALGO would take off. Obviously, there is also the chance that another, even better mousetrap will be built before that happens, in which case $1.88 will look mighty expensive before too long.

That is the risk/reward calculation that always has to be made with cryptos. The potential rewards are huge, but the risk is basically a complete and total loss of your investment, something that is rare in most other assets. It is, therefore, not for the timid, nor should any one investment represent more than a small percentage of your investable funds.

That said, though, the blockchain concept is here to stay and, at some point, a platform will emerge as the leader in the smart contract and DeFi spaces. As it stands, there is a decent chance that will be Algorand, so, providing you are aware of and comfortable with the risk involved, it is definitely a crypto to consider.

*Disclaimer: As you might have guessed if you read the above, I have a long position in ALGO.

2021-10-20 15:51:27+00:00	Crypto market hits $2.6 trillion capitalisation for the first time in history	['Jordan Major']	"For the first time in history, the cryptocurrency market has surpassed the $2.6 trillion barrier in terms of market capitalisation amid Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally, which soared to new all-time highs ahead of the second day of trading for the massively popular ProShares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Indeed, the global crypto market cap has already reached $2.613 trillion, representing a 5.6% gain over the previous day. Furthermore, the overall market volume over the past 24 hours has increased to $94.75 billion, representing a 4% increase, according to the data from CoinMarketCap.com.

In addition, the entire volume in DeFi is now $12.07 billion, accounting for 12.74% of the total 24-hour volume in the cryptocurrency market. In contrast, the volume of all stable currencies is currently $71.81 billion, representing 75.78%.

Bitcoin sets new all-time high

Moreover, Bitcoin has helped the crypto market break through the $2.6 trillion level in terms of market capitalisation for the first time ever as the flagship digital asset hit a new all-time high on October 20, 2021, following the success of ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF trading on the stock exchange for the second day in a row.

Indeed, after a spectacular comeback from a July collapse that saw the asset fall below $30,000, the cryptocurrency has reached a new all-time high propelling the BTC into the realm of price discovery.

Consequently, BTC price movement has re-entered unknown territory after breaking over the last barrier of $64,900 set April 14, 2021. Currently, the flagship digital currency is up 7.76% in the last 24 hours and 19.56% over the previous seven days, with Bitcoin now trading above $66,800 at the time of publication.

Notably, Bitcoin appears to be following the traders stock-2-flow chart, which he earlier tweeted about back in June.

La Monica', 'Cnn Business']	"New York (CNN Business) Only a week ago, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $67,000. But investors have been dumping the world's most valuable cryptocurrency in favor of the new kid -- or rather, new dog -- in town: shiba inu.

The price of one bitcoin fell more than 5% Wednesday and was trading around $59,000, 12% below last week's record levels. For any other asset, like a stock or bond, a drop that steep in such a short time would be considered a market correction.

For bitcoin, it's just business as usual. Crypto investors have come to accept that bitcoin is volatile.

Despite more than 13,000 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap — ranging from dogecoin and shiba inu to more obscure tokens with even goofier names, such as Elon's Marvin, Dogelon Mars, Baby Floki Billionaire and Kitty Inu...(because cat lovers own crypto too) — bitcoin remains the dominant digital currency.

The total number of bitcoins now in circulation have a market value of $1.1 trillion. That's nearly half of the size of the entire crypto market, which is valued at $2.47 trillion."

What also moved with them are some traditional day trade strategies used in stock markets, which include breakout tactics to scalping (trading in small price movements without targeting massive profits). But one stock market tactic in particular that has proven popular for intra-day crypto traders is “front running”.

Front runners are abusing cryptocurrency exchanges by soaking hundreds of millions in crypto from trader transactions on the Ethereum network.

Here we explain what front running is and if you’re a crypto trader, how you can play safe.

Read more | Explained: Crypto banking and decentralized finance

What is front-running?

Front running is when a trader takes advantage of an insider ‘tip’ or knowledge about a future transaction that is about to substantially affect the price of a crypto coin.

So essentially the traders buy or sell a crypto coin based on advance, non-public knowledge or information that they believe will affect its price. That information is not yet public, giving the trader an advantage over other traders, and the market at large. In fact, front running is a form of insider trading and market manipulation.

Traditionally, in a stock market exchange, when stocks were exchanged on paper, on the floor of the stock trade, front-running alluded to the act of rushing to the front of the line when you realised some huge exchange was coming.

Aliasgar Merchant, Developer Relations Engineer, Tendermint, explains to indianexpress.com: “For instance, in the event that you realised somebody was going to purchase a colossal measure of some stock, you could get it before them, and then sell it at a higher market cost after their huge purchase.”

But how does this function in a crypto market?

The idea isn’t very different in the crypto world. However, what’s different is the technique. In the crypto world, bots can be used to automate trading. Simply put, bots are just programs that facilitate trading. In this case, front-running bots automatically synthesise and evaluate the information available in the market and perform front-running for users.

Bots deployed by front-runners jump the queue and insert a higher transaction fee for placing the order, while the trader who initiated the transaction is forced to pay the price that they didn’t see coming.

For instance, if a crypto trader knew that Tesla’s stock was about to be bought by Elon Musk in volume up to $15 million, the front runner bot could buy automatically order right before that, and when $15 million is bought which causes the price to jump, the bot will immediately place a sell order, thereby book maximum profit out of the trade.

CyberNews researchers looked at the overall value extracted, from April 24 to May 24, as well as how much value front-runners drained from trades in the last 24 hours of this monthly interval. Their investigation revealed that front-runners extracted more than $12 million from transactions every day, with monthly losses suffered by traders reaching nearly $280 million in cryptocurrency, which can amount to billions of dollars in yearly losses.

What’s the solution?

A basic way to apply to limit front run is that instead of performing many large transactions at the same time, users split their transaction, which will reduce the attractiveness of transactions for front-running bots because of the value that can be mined.

Otherwise, investors can use Telos blockchain’s EVM Maine, a fully EVM-compatible Layer 1 chain that can solve to solve problems like frontrunning in the cryptocurrencies market, high gas fees, and slow transaction speeds that plague the Ethereum network intermittently.

“Ethereum 2.0 did not ease the front-running concerns for institutional investors to go big into crypto investments. Miners keep skipping the line and increasing their spread and de facto stealing millions of dollars,” Douglas Horn, Telos chief architect asserts. “Telos EVM is faster, better, cheaper and functions on a first-come, first-serve basis. The simplicity of integrating with Metamask allows investors to trade as safely as they are used to on NASDAQ,” he added."

Raging Coronavirus to Sway Market Potential

The outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy. The regression in the stock market has directedly created concerns for the bitcoins. For instance, 12 March 2021, the price of Bitcoin fell below USD 4,000 after a sharp decline in the S&P Index in the U.S. The market crash has incited an increase in investment capital by blockchain companies to compensate for the losses. Giant blockchain analytics, Elliptic, Chainalysis, and CipherTrace declared that they have cut-price and reduced staffs or intend to do so in the immediate future to lessen the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. For instance, CipherTrace has decreased the jobs of the advertising and marketing departments. Whereas Elliptic has eliminated 30% of the workers in the U.S. and the U.K and Chainalysis has planned to reduce employees' wages by 10% to mitigate the risks.

Rising Popularity of Digital Currency to Augment Growth

The rising pattern of cryptocurrency has prompted the acknowledgment of computerized coins like Bitcoins, Litecoins, Ethers, and the sky is the limit from there. The simple and adaptable conditional strategy offered by cryptographic money has encouraged the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) movement arrangements across the world. For example, the Bank of Thailand and the Central Bank of Uruguay have applied for the tool stash to its CBDC assessment measure. The toolbox conveys a guide for the nations to gain ground rapidly and break down CBDC as a trade medium.

Moreover, the expanding interest in blockchain and cryptographic money by significant organizations will empower the rapid development of the market. For example, in October 2021, Qtum Chain Foundation, a publicly released blockchain application stage situated in Singapore reported an association with Amazon Web Services (AWS) China to convey blockchain frameworks on the AWS cloud. The organization will permit help AWS clients to utilize Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to create and distribute shrewd agreements effectively and productively.

2021-10-19 00:00:00+00:00	Love them or hate them: Cryptocurrencies are here to stay	[]	"Bitcoin has come a long way since someone or a group of someones under the name Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 about how to harness computing power around the world to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent.

Love cryptocurrencies or hate the very idea of them, they’re becoming more mainstream by the day.

Cryptocurrencies have surged so much that their total value has reached nearly $2.5 trillion, rivalling the world’s most valuable company, Apple, and have amassed more than 200 million users. At this size, it’s simply too big for the financial establishment to ignore.

Firms that cater to the world’s wealthiest families are increasingly putting some of their fortunes into crypto. Hedge funds are trading Bitcoin, which has big-name banks starting to offer them services around it. PayPal lets users buy crypto on its app, while Twitter helps people show appreciation for tweets by tipping their creators with Bitcoin.

And in the latest milestone for the industry, an easy-to-trade fund tied to Bitcoin began trading on Tuesday. Investors can buy the exchange-traded fund from ProShares through an old-school brokerage account — without having to learn what a hot or cold wallet is.

It’s all part of a movement across big businesses that see a chance to profit on the fervour around the world of crypto as a new ecosystem further builds up around it, whether they believe in it or not.

“The one thing you can say for certain is that the advent of the era of the Bitcoin ETF opens up the opportunity for Wall Street to make money on Bitcoin in a way that it hadn’t been able to previously,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “The winners in all of this are the exchanges and the asset managers and the custodians. Whether investors win or not is a big, bold question mark.”

Bitcoin has come a long way since someone or a group of someones under the name Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 about how to harness computing power around the world to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent. The price has more than doubled this year alone to roughly $62,000. It was at only $635 five years ago.

Supporters of cryptocurrencies say they offer an important benefit for any investor: a price that moves independently of the economy, rather than changing with it like so many other investments. More high-minded fans say digital assets are simply the future of finance, allowing transactions to sidestep middlemen, with fees tied to a currency that’s not beholden to any government.

Critics, meanwhile, question whether crypto is just a fad. They say it uses too much energy and point to all the stiff regulatory scrutiny around it. Last month, China declared Bitcoin transactions illegal, for example. The Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler said in August that the world of crypto doesn’t have enough investor protection and that “it’s more like the Wild West.”

That hasn’t been enough to halt the immense momentum for crypto, as it’s gone from an online curiosity to a bigger part of the cultural and corporate landscape.

In a survey by Citi Private Bank, which manages money for wealthy people at offices around the world, roughly 23 percent said they have made some investments in crypto. Another 25 percent said they are researching it.

The growing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street has created a new crop of darlings that help people buy it. Crypto trading platform Coinbase has a market value of roughly $64bn, for example, putting it on par with such established companies as Colgate-Palmolive, FedEx and Ford Motor.

In the end though, what many on Wall Street see sticking around may not be so much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but the technology that underlies them.

Called the blockchain, it allows for a public ledger that everyone can check and trust — and many expect it to lead to a wealth of innovations. It’s akin to today’s Netflix, Facebook and other services that sprung out of the infrastructure built during the boom and bust of the dot-com bubble.

JPMorgan Chase, for example, is already using blockchain technology to improve fund transfers between global banks. That’s the same JPMorgan Chase run by CEO Jamie Dimon, who said in an interview with Axios this month that Bitcoin has “got no intrinsic value”."
2021-10-14 11:33:57+00:00	2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Up 880%	['Chainalysis Team']	"This blog is a preview of our 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency report. Sign up here to download the whole thing!

We’re excited to share with you the 2021 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index. This marks the second iteration of our efforts to measure grassroots cryptocurrency adoption around the globe, after a year of huge growth for cryptocurrency markets and increased attention for the industry.

The goal of our crypto index is to provide an objective measure of which countries have the highest levels of cryptocurrency adoption. One way to do that would be to simply rank countries by transaction volume. However, that would favor only the countries with high levels of professional and institutional cryptocurrency adoption, as those market segments move the largest sums of cryptocurrency. While the professional and institutional markets are crucial, we want to highlight the countries with the greatest cryptocurrency adoption by ordinary people, and focus on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation.

Below, we’ll explain the index’s methodology and how it’s changed compared to last year before showing you the top ranked countries for cryptocurrency adoption, as well as a few trends we found interesting.

Our methodology

The Global Crypto Adoption Index is made up of three metrics, which we’ll explain in detail below. We rank all 154 countries according to each of those three metrics, take the geometric mean of each country’s ranking in all three, and then normalize that final number on a scale of 0 to 1 to give every country a score that determines the overall rankings. The closer the country’s final score is to 1, the higher the rank.

On-chain cryptocurrency value received, weighted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita

The goal of this metric is to rank each country by total cryptocurrency activity, but weight the rankings to favor countries where that amount is more significant based on the wealth of the average person and value of money generally within the country.

We calculate the metric by estimating total cryptocurrency received by that country, and weighting the on-chain value based on PPP per capita, which is a measure of the country’s wealth per resident. The higher the ratio of on-chain value received to PPP per capita, the higher the ranking, meaning that if two countries had equal cryptocurrency value received, the country with the lower PPP per capita would rank ahead.

On-chain retail value transferred, weighted by PPP per capita

The goal of this metric is to measure the activity of non-professional, individual cryptocurrency users, based on how much cryptocurrency they’re transacting compared to the wealth of the average person. We approximate individuals’ cryptocurrency activity by measuring the amount of cryptocurrency moved in retail transactions, which we designate as any transaction for under $10,000 USD worth of cryptocurrency. We then rank each country according to this metric but weight it to favor countries with a lower PPP per capita.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, weighted by PPP per capita and number of internet users

P2P trade volume makes up a significant percentage of all cryptocurrency activity, especially in emerging markets. For this index, we rank countries by their P2P trade volume and weight it to favor countries with lower PPP per capita and fewer internet users, the goal being to highlight countries where more residents are putting a larger share of their overall wealth into P2P cryptocurrency transactions.

How our methodology changed in 2021

The biggest change to our methodology this year was the elimination of a fourth metric that contributed to each country’s overall ranking in 2020: Number of deposits by country weighted by number of internet users.

We initially used this as a metric to determine which countries’ residents are carrying out the most cryptocurrency transactions, as this would capture both the number of individuals using cryptocurrency and boost countries whose residents are carrying out more transactions per user. However, while cryptocurrency deposits to centralized services like exchanges show up on-chain, any transactions within those services, such as trades within an exchange, aren’t captured on-chain, and only show up in those services’ order books, which we have limited or even no access to in some cases.

This isn’t the case for DeFi though. Transactions carried out by DeFi protocol users all show up on-chain, as no centralized service ever takes custody of users’ digital assets. That skewed our rankings toward countries with comparatively more DeFi users. Therefore, after reviewing the rankings both with and without this component, we decided to eliminate it. We also decided to create a new DeFi Adoption Index, which will be available in the coming weeks.

We’re confident in our index methodology and the modifications we made to it this year, though as with any standardized measure of regional economic activity, there are limitations. Since we rely on web traffic data, usage of VPNs and other products that mask online activity would compromise our ability to accurately assign activity to a country. However, our index takes into account hundreds of millions of transactions, so VPN usage would need to be quite widespread in order to meaningfully affect the data. Experts we spoke to agreed that the index matched their perception of the cryptocurrency market, giving us more confidence in the methodology. We look forward to continuing to tweak the index methodology to ensure that our rankings accommodate evolutions in the market and get more accurate over time.

The 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20

The table below shows the top 20 countries in our 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, as well as their rankings in the three component metrics that make up the overall rankings.

Three key trends jumped out to us as significant.

Global cryptocurrency adoption is skyrocketing

Our data shows that residents of more and more countries around the world are taking the dive into cryptocurrency or seeing existing adoption increase. In the chart below, we applied our index methodology globally by adding up all 154 countries’ index scores — made up of the three components we describe above — for each quarter from Q2 2019 to the present.

At the end of Q2 2020, following a period of little growth, total global adoption stood at 2.5 based on our summed up country index scores. At the end of Q2 2021, that total score stands at 24, suggesting that global adoption has grown by over 2300% since Q3 2019 and over 881% in the last year. Our research suggests that reasons for this increased adoption differ around the world — in emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions, while adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment. In a year when cryptocurrency prices rose dramatically, each region’s respective reasons to embrace the asset class seem to have proven compelling.

Adoption in emerging markets grows, powered by P2P platforms

Several countries in emerging markets, including Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam, and Venezuela rank high on our crypto index in large part because they have huge transaction volumes on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms when adjusted for PPP per capita and internet-using population. Our interviews with experts in these countries revealed that many residents use P2P cryptocurrency exchanges as their primary on-ramp into cryptocurrency, often because they don’t have access to centralized exchanges.

Knowing that, it’s no surprise that regions with many emergent markets account for a huge portion of web traffic to P2P services’ websites.

Central and Southern Asia, Latin America, and Africa send more web traffic to P2P platforms than regions whose countries tend to have larger economies, such as Western Europe and Eastern Asia.

Many emerging markets face significant currency devaluation, driving residents to buy cryptocurrency on P2P platforms in order to preserve their savings. Others in these areas use cryptocurrency to carry out international transactions, either for individual remittances or for commercial use cases, such as purchasing goods to import and sell. Many emerging markets represented here limit the amount of the national currency that residents can move out of the country. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins give those residents a way to circumvent those limits to meet their financial needs.

This contributes to an interesting dynamic whereby P2P platforms have a greater share of total transaction volume made up of smaller, retail-sized payments under $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency.

That makes sense given the use cases we described, as remittance payments and personal and commercial transactions carried out by merchants in emerging markets are likely to be smaller than transactions carried out by professional traders or institutional investors.

China and the U.S. dip in our rankings

Last year, China ranked fourth on our global adoption index while the U.S. ranked sixth. This year, the U.S. ranks eighth while China ranks 13th. The biggest reason both countries dropped is that their rankings in P2P trade volume weighted for internet-using population declined dramatically — China fell from 53rd in this component to 155th, while the U.S. fell from 16th to 109th.

Further analysis shows how far P2P volumes have fallen in the two countries compared to worldwide volumes. We show this in the index chart below, which shows relative change in P2P volumes for the U.S. and China compared to worldwide totals.

P2P transaction volume for the U.S. and China moved roughly in line with the worldwide total until they began to diverge around June 2020. At that point, the U.S. and China see their P2P transaction volume shrink as the rest of the world grows. While all three dip dramatically beginning in March 2021, the U.S. and China dip more and remain lower than worldwide totals. This activity may reflect increasing professionalization and institutionalization of cryptocurrency trading in the United States, and in China’s case may be related to ongoing government crackdowns on cryptocurrency trading.

What will drive the next wave of adoption?

Our data shows that growing transaction volume for centralized services and the explosive growth of DeFi are driving cryptocurrency usage in the developed world and in countries that already had substantial adoption, while P2P platforms are driving new adoption in emerging markets. Our biggest question for the next twelve months is how much adoption will continue on those platform categories compared to new and emerging models we haven’t seen yet. The clear takeaway though is this: Cryptocurrency adoption has skyrocketed in the last twelve months, and the variation in the countries contributing to that show that cryptocurrency is a truly global phenomenon.

Crypto market touches new ATH

This gives the crypto industry a lead over some of the largest tech giants, such as Apple. Bitcoin is currently hovering over a $1 trillion market cap. As highlighted by the data, the crypto market was able to reach this peak thanks to the surge in the price of the leading digital asset.

Compared to the previous $2.55 trillion record high witnessed in May, this is a watershed moment for an industry that boasts of more than $100 billion market cap in altcoins. The industry has shown a 233 percent surge in aggregate market cap from January’s $830 billion.

Analyses comparing the crypto industry to giant companies in the world show that the total cryptocurrency market cap now stands larger than even that of the biggest companies in the world.

For instance, data from CompaniesMarketcap shows that Microsoft, an American multinational tech company famous for its software, has a market cap that stands at $2.28 trillion.

Bitcoin, a pacesetter for altcoins

Taking a more cursory look at the data, Bitcoin leads the pack with $1.18 trillion in market cap. This represents a 45 percent share of the total crypto market cap.

Interestingly, the number of altcoins that have seen their market cap exceed $1 billion have also grown to over 100 tokens.

The top 10 crypto assets by market cap alone have each of their market caps exceeding $30 billion while an average of those in the top 20 exceeds $10 billion per asset.

As of press time, the market cap of Ethereum is $458 billion, that of Binance Coin stands around $79 billion, while that of Tether and Cardano stands at $70 billion and $60 billion respectively."
2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin, Ether fall sharply amid heavy profit booking	[]	"The cryptocurrency market witnessed a decline over the past 24 hours as the value of popular virtual coins fell sharply. The reason behind the decline was heavy profit bookings by investors.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell on Wednesday to the lowest in a week and a half after reaching an all-time high. However, the popular cryptocurrency is still on track for its best month since February.

It’s price was $58,867 or 6 per cent lower than its value 24 hours ago at 3:40 pm. Bitcoin’s market capitalisation fell to $1.11 trillion and the 24-hour trading volume fell to $1.84 billion.

Tony Sycamore, analyst at Australian investment platform City Index told news agency Reuters that Bitcoin’s losses were down to traders taking profit from its recent rally.

Ether also fell sharply by nearly 4.7 per cent after gaining for more than a week. Ether remained just above $4,000 or 4.68 per cent lower than its value 24 hours ago. Ether’s market capitalisation fell to $470.38 billion and the trading volume of the past 24 hours was $1.83 billion.

Most other altcoins also fell sharply during Wednesday’s session as investors looked to book profits after the recent rally.

Commenting on the momentum, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm-based crypto investment platform, said, “Over the past 24 hours we saw the markets remaining in a range bound territory. Bitcoin fell marginally and with it, dominance also came down.”

“The coming 24 hours would likely be a positive session for the altcoins,” he added.

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency on the scene and since its creation, it has dominated the crypto market. Despite the development of other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin continues to fly ahead, leading the market by a huge margin. Why are altcoins such as ethereum, Cardano and Binance Coin failing to catch up?

Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralised cryptocurrency, it was launched by an anonymous group of programmers back in 2009. The last decade may have seen a flurry of new altcoins being launched onto the crypto scene, but bitcoin has continued to be the largest player on the market. René Pomassl, CEO of Salamantex told Express.co.uk bitcoin’s advantage of being the first on the scene gave it an all-important head start against other cryptocurrencies. He said: “This means that although thousands of cryptocurrencies are now in circulation, none have had as much time to draw in as much recognition and coverage as Bitcoin.” READ MORE: Bitcoin price latest: BTC SOARS but will its value surpass Apple?

Bitcoin continues to be the most popular and well-known crypto on the market, with investors choosing to invest in bitcoin rather than in less well-known altcoins. Jeremy Cheah Associate Professor in Crypto-Finance and Digital Investment at Nottingham Business School told Express.co.uk: “In time, some cryptos might catch up as those cryptos gain popularity and become better understood.” But in the short term, it seems unlikely that altcoins will be able to close the gap between themselves and bitcoin. Bitcoin’s current price stands at £40,521.45 as recorded by Coinbase on October 13 at 2pm. In comparison, the second market leader is ethereum which was valued at just £2,549.81, followed by Binance with a value of £340.69.

It seems no other cryptocurrency can get anywhere close to bitcoin. The market leader continues to set the trends in the crypto market - as its price rises and falls, other altcoins usually mirror its movements. Mr Pomassl explained: “The dominance of bitcoin means that it is viewed by investors as an index of the crypto market as a whole. “Generally speaking, when the value of bitcoin fluctuates, so does the rest of the market.

Europe has become the world’s largest crypto market for the first time (Photo illustration by Edward Smith/Getty Images)

EUROPE has been crowned the world’s largest crypto market with investment in decentralised finance (DeFi) driving a surge in transaction volumes.

European countries received more than $1tn (£734.4bn) worth of cryptocurrency in the space of a year, which represents 25 per cent of global activity, according to a new study by Chainalysis.

The UK was the leading European country for crypto activity between June 2020 and July 2021, with $170bn worth of digital assets received.

Kim Grauer, the Director of Research at Chainalysis dubbed the UK an emerging “global professional cryptocurrency hub”.

“The region in general – Central, Northern, & Western Europe – has the biggest cryptocurrency economy of any region that we study, surpassing East Asia following China’s regulatory crackdowns earlier this year,” Grauer said.

Surging crypto trade volumes are being driven by interest in DeFi, crypto projects and applications which offer decentralised versions of the financial services traditionally offered by banks.

Share of crypto market transaction volume by region (credit: Chainalysis)

Analysis of 34 European countries showed that, in each of the nations, investment in Ether and wrapped Ether – tokens used to access a vast ecosystem of DeFi projects – attracted more capital than any other market segment.

DeFi accounted for the majority of capital invested by large institutional, retail and professional investors across the continent. Gauer confirmed that the UK’s breakaway crypto transaction volumes were “in large part driven by DeFi activity among large, institutional traders”.

In the UK, the flagship cryptocurrency – Bitcoin – accounted for 28 per cent of crypto transactions while the challenger currency Ethereum made up around 40 per cent. DeFi projects accounted for the majority of UK crypto activity with 49 per cent of revenues arising from DeFi protocols.

The comments chime with data showing that DeFi adoption is highest amongst institutional investors and professional traders who have the funds to experiment with riskier projects.

The Chainalysis report found that large institutional cryptocurrency transaction value helped to drive the growth of the European market, jumping from $1.4bn in July 2020 to $46.3bn in June 2021 as banks and financial institutions increased their crypto exposure.

It comes as data released yesterday revealed that more than six in ten institutional investors and wealth managers from the US, UK, France, Germany, and the UAE currently don’t have any exposure to cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and expect to invest for the first time within the next year.

NEW YORK (AP) — Love cryptocurrencies or hate the very idea of them, they’re becoming more mainstream by the day.

Cryptocurrencies have surged so much that their total value has reached nearly $2.5 trillion, rivaling the world’s most valuable company, Apple, and have amassed more than 200 million users. At that size, it’s simply too big for the financial establishment to ignore.

Firms that cater to the world’s wealthiest families are increasingly putting some of their fortunes into crypto. Hedge funds are trading Bitcoin, which has big-name banks starting to offer them services around it. PayPal lets users buy crypto on its app, while Twitter helps people show appreciation for tweets by tipping their creators with Bitcoin.

And in the latest milestone for the industry, an easy-to-trade fund tied to Bitcoin began trading on Tuesday. Investors can buy the exchange-traded fund from ProShares through an old-school brokerage account, without having to learn what a hot or cold wallet is.

It’s all part of a movement across big businesses that see a chance to profit on the fervor around the world of crypto, as a new ecosystem further builds up around it, whether they believe in it or not.

“The one thing you can say for certain is that the advent of the era of the Bitcoin ETF opens up the opportunity for Wall Street to make money on Bitcoin in a way that it hadn’t been able to previously,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “The winners in all of this are the exchanges and the asset managers and the custodians. Whether investors win or not is a big, bold question mark.”

Bitcoin has come a long way since someone or a group of someones under the name Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 about how to harness computing power around the world to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent. The price has more than doubled this year alone to roughly $62,000. It was at only $635 five years ago.

Supporters of cryptocurrencies say they offer an ultra-important benefit for any investor: something whose price moves independently of the economy, rather than tracking it like so many other investments do. More high-minded fans say digital assets are simply the future of finance, allowing transactions to sidestep middlemen and fees with a currency that’s not beholden to any government.

Critics, meanwhile, question whether crypto is just a fad, say it uses too much energy and point to all the stiff regulatory scrutiny shining on it. China last month declared Bitcoin transactions illegal, for example. The chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, said in August that the world of crypto doesn’t have enough investor protection and “it’s more like the Wild West.”

That hasn’t been enough to halt the immense momentum for crypto, as it’s gone from an online curiosity to a bigger part of the cultural and corporate landscape.

U.S. Bank earlier this month said it has begun offering a cryptocurrency custody service for big investment managers. That means it essentially holds their Bitcoin in safekeeping for them, and it expects to offer support for other coins soon.

Other name-brand banks have also announced intentions to offer custodial services for crypto.

“It’s not just in the fringes and dark corners of the Web that it’s happening,” said Kashif Ahmed, president of American Private Wealth in Bedford, Massachusetts.

Ahmed doesn’t recommend his clients invest in crypto. Before then, he said he’ll need to be able to “go to my local supermarket and buy things for my family and offer crypto and not be laughed out of the store.”

But others are more willing to try it.

In a survey by Citi Private Bank of family offices around the world that manage money for wealthy people, roughly 23% said they have made some investments in crypto. Another 25% said they are researching it.

The growing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street has created a new crop of darlings that help people buy it. Crypto trading platform Coinbase has a market value of roughly $64 billion, for example, putting it on par with such established companies as Colgate-Palmolive, FedEx and Ford Motor.

At Robinhood Markets, meanwhile, the company that became famous for getting a new generation of investors into the stock market is increasingly becoming a place for crypto trading. This spring was the first time when new Robinhood customers were more likely to make their first trade in cryptocurrencies rather than in stocks.

In the end, what many on Wall Street see lasting may not be as much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the technology that underlies them.

Called the blockchain, it allows for a public ledger that everyone can check and trust, and many expect it to lead to a wealth of innovations. It’s akin to today’s Netflix, Facebook and other services that sprung out of the infrastructure built during the boom and bust of the dot-com bubble.

“The applications built on this new software architecture appear to be growing more quickly than past technologies,” Bank of America strategists Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote in a recent research report positing digital assets are only in their first inning of growth. “New companies are likely to emerge and poorly positioned companies will exit, creating significant upside potential for some and downside for others.”

JPMorgan Chase, for example, is already using blockchain technology to improve fund transfers between global banks. That’s the same JPMorgan Chase run by CEO Jamie Dimon, who said in an interview with Axios this month that bitcoin has “got no intrinsic value.”"

Q: What is cryptocurrency? (If you see phrases you don't understand, check the glossary at the bottom of this article)

Cryptocurrency is like regular currency, but completely digital.

Cryptocurrency comes in many forms, intentions, and uses. The simplest way to look at cryptocurrency is a form of stored value (money) that is not beholden to governments or central agencies like banks, states, or companies. All records of its creation and when it's sent or received are stored in a sort of big digital book that anyone can access, keeping it honest. It can't (easily) be stolen or seized and can be used anywhere in the world.

Cryptocurrencies make it possible to lend, sell, buy, or borrow without an identity, credit score, or even a bank!

Some coins are used to transfer value (measured in a currency like dollars) cheaper and faster than using credit or conventional means. Meaning the cost to send someone crypto, which can be converted into regular currency, is cheaper than something like a check or wire transfer.

Others are the only form of payment, or value, that are accepted on exchanges or in software like video games. This is what made crypto very popular years ago on the dark web to purchase drugs or other illegal things through the internet. Instead of giving a drug dealer $20 USD for some drugs, a person would send that amount of USD value in the chosen crypto (usually bitcoin) directly from your crypto wallet to theirs.

However crypto is NOT just for illegal purposes. In fact, due chiefly to its price fluctuation and other reasons it has fallen out of favor on the black market.

In-depth explanation: A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data (1's and 0's) which is designed to work as a medium of exchange.

This sounds complicated but even dollar bills all have serial numbers to verify them and keep a record. It's the same with cryptocurrency. They can also all be divided into smaller pieces similar to how USD can be divided into pennies.

Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of coins, and verify the transfer of coins between people.

Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. However, it can be and many governments are working to create a crypto coin version of its respective fiat currency.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is considered centralized. When created with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through what is called distributed ledger technology. Which is typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

Bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. However, since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created with different uses and intentions.

Some tokens are exchanged directly for troy ounces of gold or make up digital art and certificates like NFT's, but that's all too complicated and advanced for a beginner to worry about. Wait to get into that part of crypto until you're familiar with the overall market and culture.

Q: What cryptocurrencies should I know about and why is it making people rich?

You've no doubt heard of Bitcoin and Dogecoin. This is primarily because the two coins went from being worth pennies to way, way more than that in a short amount of time. These coins are among two of the most popular for internet users because they are well known, and lots of people are invested in them. Which means they get the most memes and articles created about them.

This does not mean they are necessarily the best form of crypto overall or necessarily have the most inherent value. They are just the most popular, which in the crypto world, is sort of what gives them value. There are actually thousands of cryptocurrencies just like there are thousands of currencies used in countries across the world.

Some people have become very wealthy because cryptocurrencies fluctuate in value like a stock. In 2010 Bitcoin was worth pennies on the dollar when it first came out and now averages around $60,000 per coin. Demand for Bitcoin is going up and its supply is going down, basic economics dictates that its value increases as a result.

However, they also fall in value almost as quickly as they go up which is what attracts day traders to crypto. Crypto gains are also taxed like capital gains similar to regular stocks. So if you use an exchange you'll be taxed since they will report that to the IRS. However, there is a loophole when you pay directly with crypto from one wallet to another so... do with that what you will.

Coinbase.com

Above is an example of how much the price can fluctuate just in one day. Bitcoin went from 65k in the morning to 62k by midday. So you have to be comfortable making or losing up to several thousand dollars EVERYDAY.

Popular coins explained:

Bitcoin- Introduced in 2009 Created by ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" (Real name and identity unknown)

The world’s first successful cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that users can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank. There is a finite supply, only 21 million bitcoins can be produced as designed by the creator.

The Bitcoin blockchain is a full record of the network’s history validated by individuals running the Bitcoin software (nodes). This ensures that unlike most digital data, which can be freely copied and modified, bitcoins cannot be. Because bitcoins are scarce, divisible, and transferable; bitcoins are used as money.

DOGECOIN- Introduced in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and later Billy Markus

Dogecoin is a digital currency like bitcoin or ethereum. The coin was started as a joke, intended to be a satirical take on bitcoin based on a popular dog meme. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to be scarce, Dogecoin was created to have many coins. There is about 130 billion DOGE. Miners produce around 10,000 every minute.

That high amount is a key part of the idea. Dogecoin was created as a low-stakes Bitcoin alternative. When it was launched in late 2013, it began attracting a big online community.

Ethereum-Launched in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin

The decentralized Ethereum network makes it possible to create and run applications, smart contracts, and other transactions on the network. Ethereum is different from Bitcoin in that the network can perform computations as part of the mining process. People use what's called Ether as a digital currency in financial transactions, as an investment, or as a store of value. Ethereum is the blockchain network on which Ether is held and exchanged.

Litecoin- Introduced in 2011 Created by Charlie Lee

Litecoin is unique from Bitcoin in that it can produce a greater number of coins and its transaction speed is faster. The creators say it was intended to be a lighter version of Bitcoin. Litecoin can accommodate 84 million coins compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. Litecoin was founded with the goal of prioritizing transaction speed and that's what attracts many people to the coin. As of October 2021, the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is around $1.2 trillion, making its market cap much larger than Litecoin, which has a total value of around $14.5 billion.

Stellar Lumen (XLM)- Introduced in 2015 Created by Jed McCaleb

Stellar is a decentralized computer network that operates using blockchain technology. On the Stellar network, you can trade its form of currency, which is called XLM. The creators say Stellar was designed to reduce transaction costs and serve as a bridge between fiat, digital and other currencies. The intended purpose of Stellar is to connect financial institutions via the blockchain and provide cheap transactions in developing markets. According to Stellar’s website, there are 50 billion lumens in circulation. Stellar will not produce any more lumens, so they cannot be mined.

There are many, many more cryptocurrencies but the top 25 are the most important to know at the start. Remember, there is more to cryptocurrency than just Bitcoin.

Q: How do I get into cryptocurrency?

The easiest way to start buying and holding cryptocurrency would be with an exchange. There are several popular ones and you can use them right on your smartphone. This allows holders to buy, sell, and store their crypto on their phone or on a computer.

All you need is to download the app and enter your info and connect to a bank account. After that, you can trade instantly, but be careful, you might get addicted and start checking it all the time...

Any amount of money is enough to get started because you can buy slivers of a coin, it doesn't need to be a whole coin. However, experts agree it's best to invest at least $100 across a few different coins to start.

Before making any investment decisions, please consult with financial planners and experts.

Exchanges:

Robinhood.com

Robinhood allows users to trade stocks and several cryptocurrencies. Also, Robinhood will give you a free stock for joining.

Coinbase.com

Coinbase is one of the largest and most user-friendly apps dedicated to cryptocurrency. Follow this link to start and you'll get 10% of your first $100 invested paid back in Bitcoin.

For the more advanced, there are ""wallet"" apps that can be downloaded. This would mean the coins are held on your device in the storage drive, or in a virtual wallet. Users can access this wallet with a unique code.

Examples include Coinbase wallet or Webull which doubles as an exchange.

When buying, experts agree its best to stick to the top 100 cryptocurrencies as they are relatively low risk and are quality projects. Anything under the top 200 is just gambling as most of the quality projects are already created and in the top 100.

Conclusion:

This is by no means all there is to know about crypto. However, this should be a great jumping-off point to learn more. More advanced topics include how crypto and the systems they are used with could replace all currencies, middlemen, and even governments.

The term is also commonly used to describe coins and tokens created after bitcoin. Blockchain - A growing list of records, called blocks , that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

As a result, many private and even institutional investors today are looking to explore the world of crypto investment. Depending on where you are in the world, these approaches will vary.

Africa and Europe are two distinctly different worlds both politically and economically. This creates different investment opportunities for sure. Europe is a little more conservative in its investment due to, and causing, the continent’s wealthy status.

Countries such as Germany sit atop a gigantic economic surplus that some have criticized as selfish. Conversely, Africa has frequently explored higher-risk investment opportunities. Today this takes the form of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Dogecoin.

These assets entail a much bigger risk but they make sense for African investors as they are somewhat used to greater currency fluctuations and overall uncertainty. Additionally, crypto investment for many Africans is a way to circumnavigate what we largely regard as poor local fiscal and monetary policies. Policy that is often seen ultimately as harming consumers, stifling growth and making it harder to turn your efforts at work into something worthwhile.

Crypto Investment in Europe: Who Does It and How Often?

Individuals and institutions who invest in cryptocurrencies are split on the focus of their investment. Some companies and individuals are keen to buy up Bitcoin and other high-value cryptocurrencies as well as invest in mining, which is particularly important to companies that want to get ahead of events and utilize their spare capital to bring in more money.

So, these are the investors and strategies that focus on developing crypto and Bitcoin a little further. Then you have the second type of investors who are far keener on exploring the underpinning technology, i.e. blockchain. Blockchain brings in some excellent value for the end-consumer and businesses.

Thanks to this technology, processes are automated and secured as there could be no human error in the public ledger which automates shipments and other transactions that save time, effort and boost precision and productivity.

Europe is for now more open to embracing blockchain as its go-to investment option. Cryptocurrencies and digital currencies seem a good idea up to a point. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) is working on a digital currency project that will supposedly run parallel with the euro in a bid to create more stability and help the European Union move towards a single currency online that allows it to embrace innovation.

How about Crypto Investment in Europe?

Crypto investment in Europe is a slightly different kind. There are still the big technological leaps that drive the industry forward as a whole, naturally, but there are also the higher-risk investments. Many interesting cryptocurrency developments in Europe center around France. Often thought of as Europe’s digital and innovative hub, French’s companies and individuals seem interested in jumping into the cryptocurrency market, but not in the same way as African investors.

French companies and private individuals seem fairly reluctant to buy into cryptocurrencies as an asset. The curiosity appears to be there, but conservative investment culture means many are simply looking into the possibility but not pulling the trigger. It seems that bitcoin isn’t the favored crypto option for many european and french investors.

Dogecoin or Shiba Inu are two perfect examples of how people in the continent are always going to seek and try to ensure that they are ahead by simply opting for the assets they think would go up. These two currencies are not simply pure speculation. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have similar traits to Bitcoins in France, as they serve as a powerful payment medium that can be used for anything from groceries to banking, to entertainment such as online casinos. FIAT payments may be the norm, but Bitcoin entertainment and purchases are becoming far more common than you think.

Europeans seem to have more FIAT reserves and they are reluctant to risk them on digital currencies, but the immense gains they could extract by putting a small amount on crypto are still tempting.

Of course, much of this is rooted in speculation rather than hard, cold facts, which is another reason for concern. Then again, treating your investment money as something you can risk and lose is the best policy to becoming a successful investor.

Which Model Is More Sustainable?

In terms of sustainability, there are several things to consider here. To make it easier to follow through, we will simply list them as bullet lists:

Long-term goals

Return on investment

Moving with new technology

Each of these is an important factor to consider when it comes to sustainability and long-term prospects. Of course, some options promise a BIGGER potential return which is what tempts many people to stick with that option over another.

Ultimately, whether you invest in Europe or Africa, you ought to consider your own specific needs and not cave in to pressure as to what may or may not be popular among investment communities."
2021-10-17 12:30:06+00:00	What does this development indicate for Ethereum, going forward	['Aaryamann Shrivastava']	"Ethereum has been following Bitcoin’s lead along with the entire crypto market as it rallied this month. Trading at $3914.85, the altcoin is in a good spot and the same can be observed from investors’ perspective as well. But this development could put a halt to the good mood prevailing in the market.

Ethereum on a roll

After a 30.40% rally this month, ETH managed to make things easier for its investors. At the time of writing the number of addresses in loss fell to a 1 month low of merely 2.17 million, which represents only 1% of all Ethereum investors.

In fact, investors probably even took advantage of Ethereum’s rally towards $4k and maybe sold their holdings. And these sellers weren’t regular traders either. Mid-term holders, who held ETH for 3 – 6 months, and long-term holders who held their balance for at least 2 – 3 years, sold off a majority of their holdings this month.

Mid-term holders’ supply reached a 6 month low and long-term holders’ supply fell to a 7-month low.

Surprisingly a chunk of ETH was actually picked up by whales or rich cohorts from exchanges as addresses holding more than 10k ETH rose in 48 hours. Even at just 10,000 ETH in every address, at least $4.2 billion worth of ETH was bought.

But the selling by MTH and LTH was not some random selling for profit incident. There is a strong possibility that these investors are preparing for soon to arrive price fall.

A price fall?

Indeed. The very first indication of the same comes from the market top created today as supply in profit reached 98.62%. A market top usually is followed by some price fall. In the past too (September 15), when a market top was formed, price fall followed and the same was hinted back then.

So it wouldn’t be a surprise if the same happens again. And on top of that Relative Strength Index’s current position supports the same argument. We can see that RSI is close to breaching the overbought zone for the first time this month.

But we must observe whether the RSI cooldown is accompanied by a price dip or simple consolidation.

In any case, taking precautions is always better than regretting."

Over 10,000 BTC were sold on OKEx amid the crypto market cap surge.

The digital finance world is experiencing a mix of reactions these days. However, it is worth mentioning that as of today, the global crypto market cap index has seen an upward surge of $2.5 trillion. Since the start of this year, the crypto market has risen by 233%.

In fact, this monumental increase in the crypto market cap value is quite a welcoming gesture that every crypto advocate hopes to see. Adding more to this, the trading volume of BTC/USDT pairs has also increased drastically to over 10,000 BTC sold today on the OKEx exchange.

To note, one of the on-chain analytics firm’s Wu Blockchain gave the BTC/USDT announcement today. Specifically, Wu Blockchain cited the BTC/USDT trading volume statista directly from Trading View.

Also, it mentioned that they seem to be sensing another pending 14,000 BTC sell order still on the OKEx exchange. A few minutes after disclosing this, the latter then said the pending order got away by the buy order that was also in BTC/USDT.

In the same breath, Bitcoin Magazine has also tweeted that the $38 billion Grayscale Bitcoin trust will soon be converted into ETF. This milestone would be achieved as the proposals filed to approve Bitcoin’s Future Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) is yet to be accepted.

Here are some highlights from the crypto market.

Bitcoin news

The data shows that large transactions increase as whales move their funds. This shows the maturity of Bitcoin as a macro asset class.

follow report In Glassnode’s latest weekly newspaper, large transactions are increasingly dominating the BTC network, suggesting that whales and institutional investors are showing a growing interest in the cryptocurrency.

The graph above shows that trading volume increased after a sharp drop in June and has been at a low level since then. The high trading volume shows that there is currently great interest in this coin.

There is a box on the chart that covers the trading volume from $ 13.6 billion to $ 16.8 billion. This box marks two regions of most of the trading volume where values ​​are close to the ATH level.

The difference between the two peaks becomes clear on closer inspection of the histogram. It seems that recently transactions over USD 10 million have become more and more dominant.

These big businesses include whales, institutional investors, dealing desks, and other high quality companies and funds. The rise in whales shows that Bitcoin has matured as a macro asset.

Hanke believes in the universal law that assets that grow quickly must eventually decline quickly. According to his tweet, Bitcoin proves that it is no exception to this law as it is very volatile and speculative.

Meanwhile, another well-known bitcoin hater, Peter Schiff, points to possible future circumstances under which the U.S. government could impose additional regulations on BTC and all other bitcoins.

Ethereum news

The cryptocurrency called Secret (SCRT) is up 97% in the last seven days according to CoinGecko, jumping from about $4.50 to its current price of $8.87 at time of publishing.

SCRT’s rapid rise far outpaces Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the same time frame, which have risen about 1% and 11% respectively.

The altcoin’s market cap has exploded to $1,310,576,878 at time of writing.

Secret, formerly known as Enigma, initially aimed to bring privacy features to smart contract platforms like Ethereum.

The platform’s mission has since morphed, and Secret is now a delegated proof-of-stake blockchain designed to support a new ecosystem of decentralized apps (DApps) that protect users’ privacy.

The platform utilizes the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint consensus protocol, and users can lock up the native governance token SCRT to help secure the network and earn rewards.

To date, Secret says there are now 13 decentralized apps running on the network.

“Secret Apps are made from powerful, privacy-preserving smart contracts (i.e. secret contracts). Leveraging the computational privacy of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and secret contracts, users have privacy by default when interacting with Secret Apps – unlocking the full value of decentralized applications.”

Secret switched from Enigma (ENG) to SCRT late last year, with the cryptocurrency exchange Binance being the first large exchange to support the new crypto asset.

Several traders have made gains off Alts such as Axie Infinity (AXS), Fantom Network native token (FTM), OMG among others. All these were possible thanks to Bitcoin that crossed 50k and brought back calm and assurance to ape into the markets again. There have been speculations that the greens might continue till the end of the year as Q4 has been called “uptober”.

However, this piece will give insights and a general overview of the market. We’ll examine Bitcoin, Ethereum and potential altcoins that might blow up in the coming days and weeks.

BTC

Bitcoin is currently trading above $56,000 levels and is eyeing the 57k mark. Over the weekend, the price was around the 55-56k levels which made some analysts suggest that failure to push the price above 56,000 levels might see a drop to 53-52k. But BTC has crossed 56k and it’s just less than $300 from hitting 57k at the time of writing. However, there seems to be a resistance level around 56,800. If the price is pushed above those levels, BTC might see $59-60k and beyond this week.

ETH

One dominant event in the Ethereum network has been the burning of many ETH coins which happened last month or thereabouts. There have been suggestions that a supply shock is imminent. Implication of this will be a jump in price of ETH which might kickstart the Alt season. ETH is currently trading above $3,600 at the time of this publication. With the current greens in the market, ETH might add a few gains in the coming days. A drop in Bitcoin Dominance might lead to a shoot up in price.

FTM

As reported by CryptoTVplus recently, Fantom is the fastest growing blockchain network at the moment with more than 20 protocols built on it. Also, the TVL is growing at a crazy rate. Besides these, it broke a new ATH last week and analysts suggest the top is still far. One might want to look into this coin.

TRIAS

TRIAS is another token to look into this week. It has been ranging for a couple of weeks, if not months. It broke the $10 level yesterday, after weeks of ranging. Last ATH was $32. It has a total supply of 10M tokens and a market capitalization of $16M. These are very good fundamentals for a coin one might be looking to add to a watchlist.

JUNO

JUNO is the native token of the JUNO network. It is an interoperable smart contract network that was launched on the Cosmos ecosystem a few weeks back. Since launch, JUNO has done more than 200% in profit.

2021-10-26 15:54:21+00:00	Crypto ETPs post record flows week following ProShares bitcoin ETF launch	[]	"Crypto ETPs post record flows week following ProShares bitcoin ETF launch

Cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP) inflows posted their biggest week on record after raking in $1.5bn on the back of the launch of the first futures-backed bitcoin ETF in the US.

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) alone accounted for $1.2bn of the flows after it launched on Tuesday 19 October – following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – to become the fastest ETF to break the $1bn mark in history.

This was followed by the launch of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) last Friday which saw an asset inflow of roughly $78m on its first day of trading.

Investors had been piling into bitcoin ETPs in the run-up to the SEC’s approval, recording roughly $740m in the nine weeks prior.

However, this was dwarfed by the launch of the BITO as flows smashed the previous weekly record of $640m recorded in February this year, according to data from crypto ETP issuer CoinShares.

It takes year-to-date inflows in crypto ETPs to $8bn, over 10% of the entire digital assets under management of $76.7bn.

Commenting on the flows, James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, said: “The record inflows were a direct result of the SEC allowing a bitcoin ETF investing in futures and the consequent listing of two bitcoin investment products with inflows totalling $1.2bn.”

Away from the US, bitcoin recorded inflows of $138m while CoinShares recorded outflows of $58m in its bitcoin product as investors cashed in on rising bitcoin price.

Bitcoin broke through its all-time high last week, peaking at $66,000 on Wednesday, before finishing the week 2% down at $60,600.

Ethereum continued to see outflows, with investors taking $1.4m out of the digital asset, which Butterfill said was a result of minor profit taking as the price closes in on an all-time-high.

Elsewhere, solana, cardano and binance continued to see inflows, taking in $8.1m, $5.3m and $1.8m, respectively."

On Friday, Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) shares edged higher by 2% after announcing solid fiscal Q3 results. The company reported its most recent quarterly results before markets opened, beating analyst expectations on revenue and funds from operations (FFO). The company also boosted its guidance for FY 2021, pushing its FFO forecast ahead of expectations.

Prologis posted an FQ3 FFO per share of $1.04, slightly ahead of the consensus Street estimate of $1.03. On the other hand, revenue for the quarter grew by 9.3% Y/Y to $1.19 billion, $150 million ahead of estimates.

The company now expects to report FY2021 core diluted FFO per share of $4.11-$4.13, compared to the average Street forecast of $4.07.

Time to buy or sell PLD shares?

From an investment perspective, Prologis shares trade at a steep trailing 12-month P/E of 65.41 and a forward P/E of 64.69, making the stock less attractive to value investors. However, valuing the stock based on FFOs, PLD seems reasonably valued with a price-FFO ratio of 34.55.

Therefore, although the company’s bottom-line growth prospects are less exciting, some value investors could find it compelling after boosting FFO expectations.

Source – TradingView

Technically, Prologis shares seem to be trading within a sharply ascending channel formation. The stock recently bounced off the 100-day moving average, surging into overbought conditions of the 14-day RSI.

Therefore, with PLD shares trading at new all-time highs, the stock appears poised for an imminent pullback. As a result, investors could target potential pullback profits at about $134.12, or lower at $130.16. On the other hand, if the stock price continues to rise, it could find resistance at $142.14.

Time to short PLD shares?

In summary, although Prologis outperformed analyst expectations in its most recent quarterly results, the stock seems to have recently skyrocketed to overbought conditions, creating an opportunity for a pullback.

Therefore, given the company’s steep valuation multiples and weak growth outlook, it may be best to wait for the price to retreat towards a key support level before buying.

2021-10-18 00:00:00+00:00	Is Zillow stock a buy or sell as it pauses home-flipping service to clear backlog?	[]	"Md Motiur is a Market Analyst at Invezz covering the North American, European, and Asian stock markets. He has… read more

On Monday, Zillow Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ZG) shares declined by 9% after the company said it won’t be buying more houses after reaching capacity for the year. Zillow is pausing its property-flipping services amid a growing backlog of unrenovated homes.

The company is facing shortages of workers used to fix up the property amid rising demand for Zillow Offers. As a result, it has paused new purchases until it can find a solution for the backlog.

Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.

A Zillow spokesperson wrote in an email:

We are beyond operational capacity in our Zillow Offers business and are not taking on additional contracts to purchase homes at this time.

Investors fear the company could lose a significant share of the year-end business to its close peer, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (BMV:OPEN1).

Is it too late to sell ZG shares?

From an investment perspective, Zillow shares trade at steep trailing 12-month and forward P/E ratios of 158.22 and 78.91, respectively. As a result, value investors may opt for alternatives in the market.

However, with analysts expecting earnings to grow by more than 51% this year before rising at an average annual rate of 73.50% over the next five years, its growth prospects look exciting.

Therefore, investors willing to overlook short-term turbulence could find it as a compelling option for the portfolios.

Source – TradingView

Technically, Zillow shares seem to be trading within a descending channel formation in the intraday chart. In addition, the stock pulled back sharply on Monday, pushing the stock closer to oversold conditions.

Therefore, given ZG’s exciting growth prospects, long-term investors could choose to capitalise on the pullback by targeting profits at about $96.22, or higher at $111.77.

On the other hand, $73.32 and $55.88 are crucial support zones.

It could be time to buy

In summary, although Zillow shares trade at steep valuation multiples, its long-term growth prospects outweigh short-term risks.

Therefore, with shares pulling back sharply on Monday, it could be a perfect opportunity to invest in ZG stock.

Is it just an idea? Have you done the research, or are you in the running to start the production? We hear from Colin and Michele, who tell us their ‘ideas to action’ process and gain a fundamental understanding of how entrepreneurs all follow the same process.

The beginning

The first thing Colin does when an idea sparks to mind is head over to godaddy.com to ensure he has ownership of his idea and domain name.

Michele does in-depth research on her idea to see if the domain name is available and establishes whether the patent has already been taken.

Michele said it is critically important to pick your domain name. “Picking a name really helps you to focus on your idea.”

Following this, Michele does a scan across all social media platforms to see if her domain name is available.

Stage gates

Colin likes to set up ‘stage gates’ so that he is able to visualize a company a certain size. A type of deadline to reach, a goal to achieve, what is doable, and what is not. He said, “If I cannot reach those stage gates, I either need to pivot or get out of that business.”

Do you fall in love with company and business ideas and find yourself holding on for too long? Colin said it’s time to stop, and knowing when to let go is crucial to you preventing yourself from losing time and money; this is the benefit of stage gates.

Is the business scalable?

It is easy to get excited about something in the short term, but is your business idea longstanding? Does it have legs? Can it grow, and can you be working on this business for the next 10 to 15 years?

Michele gets hung up on her next big idea and says it is essential to recognize that it is “highly improbable” to always come up with ideas that will be successful and the next “big thing.” So, that is why considering whether a company is scalable is a beneficial tool to help you focus on building a company rather than hitting the jackpot.

Fundraising

Funding is typically one of the most difficult stages of the ‘ideas to action’ process. Colin recommends using your own personal or family money to get your idea off the ground until you can prove a concept. Once you’ve proven a concept, it’s much easier to raise funding.

There are funding opportunities within government funding schemes. Don’t be ashamed to turn to the government for a helping hand in your startup if you need to.

Facebook and Google also offer free advertising, a great way to get your foot in the door!

Crowdfunding is a whole other conversation; “crowdfunding needs a marketing engine ready to fuel your kickstart business,” said Michele.

Production

The next stage is production; how do you bring your product to fruition? If you’ve got the money and the go-ahead, what next?

Michele said figuring out “how to acquire a valued customer” is a popular way to help your micro company reach its potential. Is the market responding to your product? Is it a design flaw? What are the competitors like? How big is the market you’re trying to get into? Find out the challenges in the market and face them head-on.
