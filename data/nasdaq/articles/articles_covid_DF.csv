The leading crypto has stabilized for the moment at $6065, but we may see further downside price movement as investors panic and a global recession looms.

Crypto Market Sees Catastrophic Losses

Bitcoin has had an apocalyptic sell off in the last 24 hours, while investors in many of the world’s financial markets are panic selling everything as fear and uncertainty from the impact of Coronavirus shakes the world financial markets. Even the safe haven investment of gold is down.

Bitcoin shed $22 billion overnight as investors pulled $68 billion from the crypto markets. In one hour Bitcoin had fallen by 17%. Let’s take a look at 3 major reasons for why the crash happened.

1. Traditional Markets Experience Worst Day Since 2008

Traditional markets are a trainwreck, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 have lost trillions in value in the last week. Bonds are tanking, as the yield curve risks going inverse. Goldman Sachs has declared the bull market over, and Oil has been plummeting due to a price war between Russia and OPEC.

Much of the fear and uncertainty surrounding the impact of Coronavirus on traditional markets has caused a sell off in riskier assets like Bitcoin as traders cover margin calls. The Fed has been increasing repo market operations to the tune of $175 billion per day to provide liquidity. President Trump has called for a huge stimulus plan to reassure the tumbling markets. Wall St. may shut down over fears of infection. We have a black swan impacting every aspect of the economy.

2. Bitcoin Market Cap Drops 50%

Bitcoin lost half its market cap since yesterday. Bitcoin’s market cap was $260 billion yesterday, and today its market cap sits at $110,780,057,889. This is a reduction in market cap of -57.69%. The rest of the crypto markets have fared much worse.

As the flash crash took place altcoin investors saw altcoins fall at an even more accelerated pace than Bitcoin. This caused many investors to flee to Bitcoin pushing Bitcoin dominance 65.3%. Every single coin on the first page of coinmarketcap is in the red at the moment. Other top coins have lost more than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Ethereum, Binance, Tezos, Link, and many other leading altcoins lost 20-30% in the crash as well.

3. PlusToken Scammers Triggered the Crypto Selling Frenzy

The Plus Token scammers started dumping 13,000 Bitcoin which sparked the initial sell off. We reported on a huge movement of coins from wallets known to be connected to the Plus Token scam over the weekend.

The Plus Token wallets have been dumping around 12,000 Bitcoin per month, and each time they start selling they crash the price of the market. This latest round of Plus Token Bitcoin sales just happened to coincide with the coronavirus black swan event which has been wreaking havoc across the entire global economy. The virus is causing manufacturing in China to run at half capacity and is provoking fears of supply chain disruptions, as well as a global recession. The worst part is that the plus token scammers still have over 60,000 BTC to get rid off, according to blockchain data tracking the wallets containing the stolen funds.

What do you think was the biggest cause for today’s crypto market crash? Let us know in the comments!

2020-01-27 18:00:15+00:00	Crypto Market Gains $17 Billion in 48 hours, Are Bulls Back?	[]	"The global crypto market cap has risen over $17 Billion USD in the last 48 hours, driving Bitcoin tantalizingly close to $9,000. Could this be an early indication that the bulls are back?

Has the crypto market turned long-term bullish?

In the last 48 hours, the overall crypto market cap has seen a stunning cash injection of over $17 billion USD. This could be an exciting early indicator that the pendulum of market sentiment has swung back to favor bullish traders. As of this writing, the market currently sits at $246 billion USD, if it can keep this positive momentum and cross the $250 billion USD mark, then this could be a strong reversal signal.

The crypto market has not crossed the $250 billion market cap threshold since last November. This would signal the end of a 7 month bearish decline in market capital, and breathe new life into long positions. The bearish sentiment has been in effect since last July when Bitcoin hit it’s yearly high for 2019 of $14,000 USD.Bitcoin right now, however, is up 5% for the day, and is approaching a price of $9,000 USD.

If the total crypto market cap can cross the $250 billion level, we may see a higher high for the first time since last June.

This could be a hint of the start of an explosive breakout in anticipation of Bitcoin’s halving scheduled to take place in May.

Bitcoin analysts can’t seem to agree on what stage of the market cycle we are in

Bitcoin is a very small, nascent market with a high degree of volatility, so making predictions on price is never easy. In the past week, crypto analysts have predicted a bearish decline which was expected due to the yearly decline in price and volume seen from the Chinese New Years celebrations. However, it seems these predictions did not pan out as expected, and Bitcoin has gone on to have its best January since 2012.

In another price forecast from the last week, several high profile traders, including the legendary Peter Brandt, predicted that the expected Chinese New Years slump would not occur, and that the market could break out in a bullish direction. So far, it seems like they might be on to something.

If the Bitcoin market can continue it’s bullish momentum and cross the $250 Billion mark, it could be the corroborating evidence needed by traders to confirm their bullish suspicions. The looming spectre of Bitcoin’s halving may be having an unseen impact, as institutional investors load up on cheap BTC, as it fluctuates in the heavy accumulation zone of $6000-$8000 reported by Tuur Demeester of Adamant Capital.

If we do see the crypto market make a reversal of the 7 month decline, we can possibly expect to see some fireworks as traders position themselves for front running the hype surrounding Bitcoin’s halving.

Has the market gone bullish, or are we going to see more bearish price action? Let us know in the comments!

2019-11-21 15:54:24+00:00	Bitcoin crashes to $7,500 as crypto market dumps	['Decrypt', 'Daniel Phillips']	"In the last hour, practically the entire cryptocurrency market witnessed a sudden crash, wiping more than $5 billion of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. As it stands, the global market cap currently sits at $209.2 billion, down from over $222 billion this time yesterday.

Looking at the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (barring stablecoins), all except a single outlier are experiencing significant losses. As it stands, Tezos (XTZ) is the only cryptocurrency that has resisted the trend, gaining almost 4%—though this might not be for long.

Among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), EOS and Binance Coin (BNB) are all down more than 8%, whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are down 5.8% and 4% respectively. The value of Bitcoin is rapidly changing, but currently sits at around $7,600—after briefly dropping to under $7,500 following a flash dump.

This continues a week of almost incessant decline from most major cryptocurrencies, with the entire market shrinking by more than 10% in this time. As for the exact cause behind the move, this remains uncertain but is likely linked to Bitcoin breaking below the $8,000 threshold yesterday. After a period of uncertainty owed to recent hacks, Bitcoin and the rest of the market could have either recovered or dropped further—however, it appears to be the latter."

Date Written: April 10, 2020

Abstract

When large idiosyncratic shocks hit a cryptocurrency, some of its peers experience unusually large returns of the opposite sign. The co-movement is concentrated among peers that are co-mentioned with shocked cryptos in the news, and that are listed in the same exchanges as shocked cryptos. It is a form of mis-pricing that vanishes after several weeks, giving rise to predictable returns. We propose a profitable trading strategy that exploits this predictability, and explain our results with a slow information processing mechanism. To establish our results, we develop a novel natural language processing technology that identifies crypto peers from news data. Our results highlight the news as a key driver of co-movement among peer assets."

2020-02-10 16:15:36+00:00	Bitcoin Whale Gives Warning About Inflated Market	[]	"One of the leading traders on Bitfinex and a notable Bitcoin whale has given a warning about the impact of ‘phantom money’ on the market.

How much of cryptocurrency trading is real? By some estimates, only a small fraction of the entire market. A bombshell report in March 2019 found that around 95% of the entire market is fake, as BeInCrypto has previously reported. Since then, exchanges and various exchange data sites have put in stricter reporting standards with metrics like ‘real liquidity.’

Despite these changes, however, one whale claims that the market is still incredibly ‘inflated.’ Joe007 (@J0E007) is a prominent Bitcoin whale in the cryptocurrency world. Often known for topping Bitfinex leaderboards, he’s also been outspoken on rumors in the industry—and often doesn’t hold back criticism.

Sponsored Sponsored

As Bitcoin breaks the $10,000 price point and the entire market rallies, Joe007 criticized the amount of so-called “phantom money” in the market. He writes: “At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show.”

You can push the price only so long with fantom money. At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show. — Joe007 signals·alerts·funds are scams, all of them (@J0E007) February 9, 2020

Sponsored Sponsored

However, recent metrics seem to contradict Joe007’s claim about this rally being based on the so-called ‘phantom money.’ On-chain investor activity has increased significantly parallel to this rally, as also reported by BeInCrypto. This didn’t happen when Bitcoin broke $10,000 in the summer of 2019, so there’s no reason to believe that this rally is less legitimate than others.

Joe007 is known for stirring the pot on Twitter and causing controversy. For example, last month Joe007 claimed that Binance was outright faking their numbers. He’s also taken issue with Huobi and OKEx faking their reported trading stats as well. A known critic of Bitcoin SV (BSV), Joe007 has also said that BSV delistings may have helped the coin ‘scam pump’ much easier due to low liquidity.

Sponsored Sponsored

Whether or not Joe007 is correct about the cryptocurrency market’s current rally remains to be seen. As of now, Bitcoin has dropped down under the $10,000 price point and is currently trading at around $9,800."

The broader cryptocurrency market came under pressure on the second trading day of 2020, as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies slipped into negative territory for the month.

The first cryptocurrency fell back towards $7,050 after being rejected from its 200-period moving average on the four-hour time frame.

BTC/USD shorts on the Bitfinex trading exchange were at their highest level since Dec 20, while BTC/USD longs were at their weakest since Dec 16

Bitcoin Cash tested towards $200 and is currently the worst performer inside the top 5 with losses of around 2.5%, while Bitcoin SV was the biggest loser inside the top 10, and traded down by around -3.5%

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is currently $184 billion as measured by TradingView, a loss of $2 billion since Jan 1.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin has slipped back under the $7,100 support level and remains vulnerable to further losses while trading below the $7,250.

Despite the recent decline, bullish reversal patterns on the lower time frame highlights that a rally towards the $8,000 and beyond remains possible while the December low, around $6,450, holds firm.

Looking at the downside potential for BTC/USD, a bearish break under the $7,000 could trigger heavy BTC/USD technical selling towards the $6,780 support level.

Total Market Capitalization

The daily chart of the total market capitalization is looking increasingly bearish while price trades below the $187 billion level.

The lower time frames show highlight that the $180 billion support level remains a possible downside target while price trades under the $187 billion level.

A recovery towards the $207 billion level is required to ignite a bullish reversal pattern with substantial upside potential. The reversal pattern highlights the $230 billion level as a possible upside target.

Overall Sentiment

According to the latest data from The TIE, sentiment toward the cryptocurrency market is neutral, at 46 percent.

Bitcoin Cash has the strongest sentiment among the top 10 at 66 percent. Meanwhile, Tezos has the weakest at 37 percent."

Bitcoin was up over 10% from 24 hours previously, trading at $6,569.17 at around 11:57 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from Coindesk.

Cryptocurrency prices rallied on Tuesday even as equity markets continue to come under pressure due to coronavirus fears weighing on investors' sentiment.

The market capitalization — or entire value of the cryptocurrency market — rose over $14 billion in 24 hours at 11:47 a.m. Singapore time to reach $182.62 billion., according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.

Cryptocurrencies took a beating earlier this month. On Mar. 8, the whole market sold off following a plunge in oil prices. Then on Mar. 12, cryptocurrencies saw $93.5 billion wiped off their value in 24 hours and a 48% crash in the price of bitcoin.

Much of the selling off of cryptocurrencies has happened in lockstep with the equity market. Over the past few years, bitcoin has been likened to ""digital gold"" and has been seen by some as a safe haven asset to invest in when markets are under pressure. But bitcoin, which is still priced lower than where it was at the start of the year, appeared to be behaving more like a risk asset such as an equity.

Stocks in Europe and the U.S. closed lower again on Monday with cyptocurrencies bucking the trend. In Asia, stocks were broadly higher in Tuesday morning trade after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced an open-ended asset purchase program on Monday to support markets as the number of coronavirus cases globally continue to rise.

""We're seeing some really bullish bitcoin price action today along with other asset classes after the Fed announced unprecedented measures yesterday to shore up the economy,"" Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC by email. ""This has given a lot of confidence to investors.""

""It will be interesting to see how bitcoin fares in such an environment, given this is its first test as a safe haven asset in a market downturn and is yet to be proven."""

Cryptocurrency market prices have improved a great deal since our last market update, as the overall market capitalization of all 5,700+ coins has gained $16 billion since June 14. Most of the top digital assets have remained in a consolidated cycle and a great number of cryptos have been able to hold above their 50-day averages.

Crypto Market Capitalization Inches Toward $300 Billion

The crypto community is curious about what’s going to happen next in the land of digital currency markets.

At the time of publication, the entire crypto cap of all the coins in existence is around $277 billion and there’s roughly $21.6 billion in global trades. Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $9,342 per coin and has a $172 billion market valuation. As far as seven-day gains are concerned BTC is only up 1% for the week.

The stablecoin tether (USDT) currently holds the third-largest market valuation and it seems it will hold there for quite some time. Currently, the USDT market cap us around $9.6 billion and there’s $7 billion in global USDT trades today. XRP is the fourth largest valuation today, as each XRP is swapping for $0.19 per coin. XRP has gained 13% during the last seven days and it’s up over 8% today.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the fifth-largest market cap on Wednesday, with a valuation of around $4.4 billion at press time. Each BCH is swapping for $242 per coin and there’s $372 million in global BCH trades. Over the last 24 hours BCH has gained 2% and during the last seven days prices jumped over 8%. The top pair with bitcoin cash today is tether (USDT) with 58% of BCH trades being swapped for USDT. This is followed by BTC (26.27%), KRW (4.31%), USD (3.87%), GBP (1.95%), and ETH pairs (1.15%).

Digital Currency Market Analyst: ‘More Capital Inflows Are Needed’

This week a number of economists and analysts have been trying to predict what will drive the next cryptocurrency bull run. Etoro market analyst, Simon Peters, thinks that more institutional investment is needed to prime the bull.

“So what is going to drive the next bull run in bitcoin?” Peters asked in a weekly investor’s note. “In my view, it is institutional investment. Bitcoin is the most well-known and biggest crypto by market cap and its development to date has mainly been dominated by retail investors. As word has spread, in particular since the price boom of 2017 and 2018 where prices hit all-time highs of $20,000, we have begun to see more institutional interest. This has taken the form of institutional investors buying the underlying crypto asset and indirect investment such as buying shares in bitcoin trust companies or investing in ETPs (Exchange Traded Products).” Peters continued by adding:

If we are going to see bitcoin prices rise sustainably above the $10,000 psychological barrier and even as high as $30k or $40k, then more capital inflows are needed, which will most likely have to come from institutions. Glassnode recently shared an interesting stat, showing that 61% of bitcoin in circulation hasn’t been touched in over a year. That’s an all-time high for this metric. In fact, the last time we witnessed such inactivity was just before the great bitcoin bull run of 2017. An omen of things to come, perhaps?

A Possible 1929-like Economic Crash Might be Looming on the Horizon

The cryptocurrency community recently witnessed the significant drop in value on March 12, 2020, otherwise known as ‘Black Thursday.’ Unfortunately, another leg-down could happen again, and the popular economist A. Gary Shilling believes it will be much like 1929’s economic crash. Shilling is specifically talking about traditional commodities, stocks, and equities, as he thinks the pandemic is the “most disruptive financial and social event since World War II.” Some bitcoin speculators think that there is a strong correlation between digital currency markets and the performance of traditional equity markets.

“Stocks are [behaving] very much like that rebound in 1929 where there is absolute conviction that the virus will be under control and that massive monetary and fiscal stimuli will reinvigorate the economy,” Shilling said in his recent interview.

Even though stock markets have seen some gains in the U.S. and in China, Citi strategist Robert Buckland agrees with Shilling’s sentiment. Buckland explained to the press that institutional and retail investors should wait until prices sink lower in order to enter new positions.

Cardano Jumps 85% in Ten Days Time

Lastly, during the last two weeks, the price of cardano (ADA) jumped from a low of $0.07 per ADA to $0.129 per coin. ADA is up 25% today and is the forerunner out of the top ten coins that rests right behind the BCH market position. Just recently, ADA founder Charles Hoskinson recently talked about a possibility of cross-chain interoperability with Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

On the first of July, the Cardano development team deployed a Shelley upgrade node onto the network. The complete Shelley upgrade (hard fork) will take place on July 29. ADA did touch a high of 85% worth of weekly gains, but seven-day stats currently show the price has leveled, as ADA is up 52% for the week at $0.129 per ADA.

This Week’s Gainers and Losers

Overall it’s been a decent week for cryptocurrency investors and the top ten gainers this week includes dogecoin, vechain, constellation, cardano, acute angle cloud, sia coin, echolink, hdac, game, and ultrain. The top ten losers this week are coins like cosmochain, the SLP-based token spice, multi-collateral DAI, fanstime, egretia, fantom, nimiq, origin trail, energi, and digitex futures.

inherent nature of the underlying assets, which means they have no reliable basis for valuation

prevalence of market abuse and financial crime in the secondary market (eg cyber theft)

extreme volatility in cryptoasset price movements

inadequate understanding of cryptoassets by retail consumers

lack of legitimate investment need for retail consumers to invest in these products

These features mean retail consumers might suffer harm from sudden and unexpected losses if they invest in these products.

Unregulated transferable cryptoassets are tokens that are not ‘specified investments’ or e-money, and can be traded, which includes well-known tokens such as Bitcoin, Ether or Ripple. Specified investments are types of investment which are specified in legislation. Firms that carry out particular types of regulated activity in relation to those investments must be authorised by the FCA.

To address these harms, the FCA has made rules banning the sale, marketing and distribution to all retail consumers of any derivatives (ie contract for difference – CFDs, options and futures) and ETNs that reference unregulated transferable cryptoassets by firms acting in, or from, the UK.

The FCA estimates that retail consumers will save around £53m from the ban on these products.

Sheldon Mills, interim Executive Director of Strategy & Competition at the FCA, said: ‘This ban reflects how seriously we view the potential harm to retail consumers in these products. Consumer protection is paramount here.

‘Significant price volatility, combined with the inherent difficulties of valuing cryptoassets reliably, places retail consumers at a high risk of suffering losses from trading crypto-derivatives. We have evidence of this happening on a significant scale. The ban provides an appropriate level of protection.’

The ban will come into effect on 6 January 2021. UK consumers should continue to be alert for crypto-derivative investment scams. As the sale of derivatives and ETNs that reference certain types of cryptoassets to retail consumers is now banned, any firm offering these services to retail consumers is likely to be a scam.

For more information on these types of scams or to inform the FCA of a potential investment scam, please refer to the FCA’s ScamSmart pages.

The prime factor in the money market that determines price trends right now is still the spread of the coronavirus, especially in the US markets. The prolonged rampant battle with the COVID-19 virus is starting to chip away at the strength of the US economy as the previous “V bottom” reversal in March might fail to be sustained. This causes an excessive amount of liquidity from the unlimited quantitative easing measure lingering in the market to move back and forth with the rhythm of the situation’s development.

In this kangaroo market where the trend is unclear, investors and traders alike have to learn to manage their funds carefully. Never to go all-in but divide your ammunition into smaller batches while trying to catch a hold of the market rhythm and trade between the swing highs and lows.

The influx of large institutional investors might be the answer to why the crypto market is moving in sync with Wall Street. However, in the long term, the side effect of money printing will emerge, and only then will the digital scarcity feature of Bitcoin shine and outperform every other market.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis

In a short-term perspective, the price is still trending sideways and floating above the Fibonacci and Bollinger Band’s support at $8,800. The major resistance is unchanged at $10K but in order to confirm a clear uptrend, a higher high above $10,500 continues to be vital.

On the flip side, if Bitcoin fails to hold $8,800, the next major support according to Fibonacci’s retracement lies at $7,700. As the Bollinger Band continues to squeeze in, the trading strategy best fit for this kind of situation is still short-term trades in the range-bound of $8,800 to $10,000.

Ethereum Technical Analysis

Similar to Bitcoin, the short-term outlook of Ethereum is sideways. The important resistance is at $250 and the support at $212.

However, breaking below both the Fibonacci and Bollinger Band’s support will result in the retesting of previous support levels at $188.

The SCN30 Index has created a weekly high at 158.91 points before a swing-low to 145.54 points. The index seems to be losing momentum after reaching the all-time-high at 163 points on June 10 and followed by a series of lower-lows and lower-highs.

2020-08-03 05:29:33+00:00	Crypto Market Cools Off Over the Weekend – Bullish Trend Still Intact?	['Read More', 'About Nares Laopannarai']	"The cryptocurrency market is cooling off after an impressive rally that took us above $10K and beyond for Bitcoin (BTC). Being as overbought as most coins are, a pullback to consolidate strength is much needed at this point. Fortunately, the bull trend structures for major cryptocurrencies are still intact and a continuation in price gains seems imminent.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis

A huge rejection after testing $12,000 has not yet made Bitcoin (BTC) lose its uptrend structure. The $10,500 level, which was a former formidable resistance, has now turned into support. Buyers have stepped in and bought up BTC slightly above this level when the flash crash happened.

The upward supporting trendline in yellow currently dictates the bullish momentum and is also acting as support levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) which was highly overbought in the daily time frame has now retraced back down, consolidating more momentum for another leg up.

The multi-month long sideways price action of Bitcoin has finally come to an end and the breakout toward the upside has been made. However, the target of the breakout at Fibonacci 161.8’s level at $14,766 has not been reached. Therefore, it can be expected that Bitcoin still has more energy left for another push upward.

Ethereum Technical Analysis

Ethereum (ETH) is one of the hottest Altcoins at the moment, smashing through its yearly-high at $287 and continuing to rally to a multi-month high before getting rejected by Fibonacci 161.8’s level at $410. The ETH’s RSI was also in a highly overbought territory and the current pullback was an essential and healthy movement to cool down the engine.

On the flip side, the parabolic run of ETH has caused a vacuum space underneath. The nearest support is located at $287 while the yellow support trendline is even further below. Trade with caution and be aware of another pullback towards these support levels.

Ripple Technical Analysis

Ripple (XRP) has finally come back to life after being deemed the worst-performing high market cap altcoin of 2019. Going through more than 50% of run-ups in less than two weeks is highly impressive. However, the massive volume kicked in at around $3 level causing the price to fluctuate violently resulting in a Darth Maul wick on the daily timeframe.

The short term support for XRP lies at $0.256 and the next bullish target is at $0.347 which was XRP’s 2020 high.



In the high market cap Altcoins, XRP still lacks behind in terms of fundamental development but the longer consolidation period compared to other top 10 Altcoins indicates that XRP still has more room to grow.



The SCN30 Index adjusted slightly lower after reaching a new all-time-high (ATH) at 244.96 points on August 1st. Last week has been a blast for the SCN30 Index as it has grown more than 50 points, the largest move since its inception.

Since the rise of Bitcoin, crypto currencies have been assumed to be uncorrelated with other asset classes. During an economic downturn triggered by COVID-19 in March, however, the price of crypto currencies plunged alongside most other assets in an event since-dubbed “Black Thursday.” Since, market participants have started acknowledging non-zero correlations between crypto currencies and other assets during liquidity crises. This report challenges the theory of zero correlations and stipulates that crypto currencies are not only correlated with markets during liquidity shortages, but generally have a minor correlation with the majority of market movements."

Investors have seen central banks worldwide pump large amounts of fiat currency into the global economy, depressing prices.

Cryptocurrencies have seen a remarkable resurgence as investors flock to relative safe havens amid a flurry of quantitative easing measures by global central banks.

Central banks including the European Central Bank, Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England have announced asset-purchase schemes in recent days. Bitcoin, a finite cryptocurrency with only 21 million units in existence, has seen a 23% one-day surge. Bitcoin is currently up 21% as of 10.10 a.m. in London (6.10 a.m. ET), per Coindesk.

The cryptocurrency had been down 30% year-to-date amid a sell-off fueled by market uncertainty about the outbreak of coronavirus. However, investors may be looking to digital currencies in the wake of easing measures elsewhere. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, XRP, and bitcoin cash all saw major reversals by more than 15% over the same period.

""When it comes to bitcoin, the crypto king is on fire, and we have seen a decent rally,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a morning note.

""Given the fact that the price has crossed the $6,000 mark — an important level of resistance — the upward momentum is likely to pick up the pace, and if the price crosses the 200-day moving average on a daily time frame, it would be a huge buy signal.""

Volumes at cryptocurrency exchanges have jumped, with Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Bitfinex combined seeing a 19% bump in 24-hour exchange volume, according to data aggregator CryptoCompare.

Thus, setting the pace for other African countries – as it leads the whole African continent combined in the use of Bitcoin via transactions turnover.

Then, it becomes unsurprising to see leading crypto brands like Binance, Paxful, FTX, Crypto.com, printing their labels in Nigeria, as it is apparently one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the ever-changing world.

According to a new study seen by Nairametrics, Nigeria has seen the largest influx of activity in peer-to-peer lending in the month of October.

News continues after this ad

Data obtained from usefultulips, a BTC analytic data provider showed Nigeria leads Africa’s peer to peer lending in the month of October 2020, as it posted monthly P2P volumes of between $32.5 million, followed by South Africa and Kenya posting about $9million and $7.4 million respectively.

What they are saying

Ekene Ojieh, Head Of Public Relations, Buffalo Chase, a fast-growing crypto analytic firm, attributed the upward trend in the adoption of cryptos – most especially Bitcoin, to Nigeria’s demographic structure.

“Nigeria ranks 8th position in the largest country with crypto adoption. The reasons for this fact are not far-fetched.

“The Nigerian youth has about 32% of the entire population of about 200 million people.

READ:

“It’s easy for a young country like Nigeria to adopt the use of bitcoin because a large percentage of its population falls within the age range that is tech-savvy. Although, that’s not the only reason why many Nigerian youths adopt bitcoin.

“Nigerian youths prefer to secure their assets in bitcoin or stablecoins because naira like every other fiat currency is susceptible to inflation.

“The borderless feature of bitcoin makes payment effortless and transaction fee outrageously low.

READ:

“In the recent protest in Nigeria, we saw the sharp switch to bitcoin after the movement’s bank account was frozen making up to about 44% of the entire donation.

“Bitcoin gained an impressive 13.7% over week 43 – as per Glassnode. Bitcoin is currently traded at a $13,000 region. With the accessibility of bitcoin, we see more Nigerian youths adopting the use of bitcoin.”

READ:

It’s also critical to note that a significant number of Nigerian youths, amid #EndSARS protest that had triggered police reforms, got help from Bitcoin, on the principle that its payments were secured and had no central authority, which could breach payment. The funds were consequently used in aiding and providing medical and legal bills for some youths who had peacefully set out for such cause and got arrested in that period.

Another thing that surely stood out in the just concluded #EndSARS protest and got the rare limelight in the crypto-verse, is a Nigerian female rights group better known as the Feminist Coalition, a non-governmental organization originally created to push for gender equality in Nigeria, used the power of crypto technology in disbursing funds for injured protesters, food, water, first aid supplies – that the co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey had to lend his support.

2020-08-07 19:47:21+00:00	Send in the Institutions? The SFOX Crypto Market Report, August 2020	[]	"Summary:

The SFOX Multi-Factor Market Index has been upgraded from neutral to mildly bullish as of August 3rd.

OCC guidance, SEC votes and applications, and Russian laws paint a picture of more imminent institutional interest in crypto, particularly BTC and ETH.

ETH’s correlation with BTC is especially low, suggesting the market may be viewing it more on its own terms rather than as something that merely tracks BTC.

Generations seem split between gold and BTC as an alternative currency.

BTC futures open interest is at its highest level in almost half a year.

ETH beat Gold, the S&P 500, and all other major cryptocurrencies in month-over-month returns as of August 3rd (69.71%).

In the August 2020 edition of the SFOX crypto market report, the SFOX Research Team reviews the crypto market’s volatility, correlations, and other performance metrics throughout the past month. We’ve aggregated price, volume, correlations, and volatility data from eight leading exchanges and liquidity providers to analyze the global performance of 7 major crypto assets — BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, BSV, ETC, and RVN — all of which are available for smart-routing-powered trading on our trading platform.

The following is a report and analysis of their volatility, price correlations, and further development in the month of July and early August. (For more information on data sources and methodology, please consult the appendix at the end of the report.)

SFOX’s Current Crypto Market Outlook: Mildly Bullish

Based on our calculations and analyses, the SFOX Multi-Factor Market Index, which was set at neutral a month ago, has been upgraded to mildly bullish as of August 3rd, 2020.

We determine the monthly value of this index by using proprietary, quantifiable indicators to analyze five market factors: price momentum, trade volume, market sentiment, volatility, and continued advancement of the sector. It is calculated using a proprietary formula that combines quantified, marketwide data on asset performance, search traffic, blockchain transactions, and more. The index ranges from highly bearish to highly bullish.

All the crypto assets available for trading on SFOX showed month-over-month gains as of August 3rd, along with the S&P 500 and gold. ETH stood out with the greatest gains (69.71%), consistent with its relative outperformance over the last three months. Perhaps surprisingly to some, BTC showed lower month-over month returns than ETH, BSV, LTC, BCH, and ETC (23.21%); RVN showed the lowest month-over-month returns in the report (14.71%).

In a month where the major media cycle was bitcoin’s sustained breakout above $10000, the full story of the crypto sector, while bullish, seems to still be largely anticipatory. A large number of regulatory movements and increased action in the BTC futures market seem to mark expectations about further moves to come rather than fervor about the current state of the market; in particular, it seems as though some market participants may be keeping an eye on the potential for further institutional investment in crypto, an old refrain of the sector, on a more immediate horizon. We may also be witnessing a reaction in crypto markets and other stores of value to the increasing amount of cash flooding global economies and potentially running the risk of devaluing the dollar.

What’s Happened in the Last Month and What to Watch Next

Markets

BTC and gold both saw upward breakouts, with research suggesting a generational split between the two assets (August 4th). Gold saw 11.06% month-over-month returns as of August 3rd, while Bitcoin saw 23.21% month-over-month returns. New research from JP Morgan suggests that one possible explanation for the relatively uncorrelated increases in these two assets is that young and old retail investors are both exploring “alternative currencies” in the midst of continued inflation and market turmoil, but young retail investors have favored BTC whereas old retail investors have favored gold. To the extent that these groups perceive these assets as stores of value in weak currency markets, this could potentially reflect both younger and older generations’ bearish outlook on the current economic climate.

BTC futures open interest has reached the highest level in over five months (August 6th). Aggregated bitcoin futures open interest stood at $5.33B this Thursday, according to data from skew. The rate of increase in open interest started to accelerate on July 20th, about one week ahead of BTC’s movement upwards from the mid-$9000s range.

Traditionally, some market participants have viewed high levels of open interest as an indicator of the expectation, particularly among institutional investors, of significant future movements in the price of the underlying asset. Combined with news of further regulatory clarity and products geared at institutional investors, some might view this as a signal of larger, more sophisticated money entering the crypto markets.

Products

Grayscale Investments has filed for its Ethereum Trust to become an SEC-reporting company (August 6th). Amidst sustained interest in Ethereum as a decentralized finance vehicle and staking opportunity upon the rollout of Ethereum 2.0, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, which currently holds 1.9MM ETH (roughly $746MM), filed to become an SEC-reporting company. If approved, it would be the second cryptocurrency investment vehicle to become SEC-reporting, following in the footsteps of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, an SEC-reporting entity currently holding roughly 400,000 BTC (roughly $4.745B). Taken in conjunction with other data such as the OCC’s recent guidance on banks’ ability to custody cryptocurrencies (see below) some market participants may view this as a sign of further institutional interest in getting exposure to cryptocurrencies.

Regulatory

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued historic guidance advising that national banks are within their rights to custody cryptocurrencies (July 22nd). The OCC published an interpretive letter concluding that “a national bank may provide these cryptocurrency custody services on behalf of customers, including by holding the unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency.” This preceded BTC’s price movement out of a narrow band in the mid-$9000s to a peak of $11444.64 five days later, leading some to interpret the price increase as at least partly responsive to the OCC’s guidance on more established financial institutions’ path to entering the crypto sector. This news corresponded with SFOX’s announcement of its new Atlas platform, a full-service custody, digital asset management, trade execution, and payment processing system for banks and other financial institutions.

The U.S. Senate voted in outspoken crypto advocate Hester Peirce for a second term as SEC Commissioner (August 6th). Peirce has become known by the nickname “Crypto Mom” for her progressive views on crypto regulation, including the idea of a “safe harbor” period for token-based crypto startups. In her July 21st testimony during her nomination hearing, Peirce underscored that cryptocurrencies are “going to be here to stay, and I would like us to set up a regulatory framework that works well for crypto.”

President Vladimir Putin signed a new law, effective January 2021, providing new regulatory clarity on the status of cryptocurrencies in Russia (July 31st). The law forbids cryptocurrencies from being used to pay for goods and services, while also identifying them as “digital rights comprising monetary claims” that can be traded and held. The law further clarifies that banks may open cryptocurrency exchanges on the condition that they register with Russia’s central bank.

Technical Developments

Ethereum Classic has experienced two apparent 51% attacks in the past week (July 29th – August 6th). Analytics firm Bitquery reported that Ethereum Classic sustained a 51% attack from July 29th through August 1st, during which time an attacker reportedly stole 807,000 ETC (~$6MM equivalent). On August 6th, Bitfly reported another 51% attack, which led to the reorganization of at least 4,000 Ethereum Classic blocks. From the 27th of July through the 6th of August, the price of ETC in BTC has fallen 16%, from 0.00071954 to 0.000608.

Ethereum Classics developers advised that ETC service providers “significantly raise confirmation times on all deposits and incoming transactions.” Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin took the opportunity to recommend that Ethereum Classic switch to a proof-of-stake confirmation mechanism. ETC is still available for trading on SFOX, but withdrawals and deposits of ETC are currently disabled as a safety precaution.

The Details: Crypto Price, Volatility, and Correlation Data, July 1st – August 3rd, 2020

Price Performance: Breakout

The volume-weighted average price of Bitcoin (BTC) started July at $9202.79; BTC’s VWAP broke through the $10000 level on July 27th and has been above that threshold ever since, clocking in at $11219.71 on August 3rd.

For better visibility of ETC and RVN price movements, please consult the following graph:

While all assets tracked by SFOX’s report saw significant daily gains near the end of the past month, BSV and RVN stood out as outliers for the double-digit single-day gains: BSV gained 19.58% on July 6th, and RVN gained 10.86% on July 13th.

For greater graphical clarity, see this additional chart tracking only the daily returns of BTC, ETH, gold, and the S&P 500:

All the crypto assets available for trading on SFOX showed month-over-month gains as of August 3rd, along with the S&P 500 and gold. ETH stood out with the greatest gains (69.71%), consistent with its relative performance over the last three months. Perhaps surprisingly to some, BTC showed lower month-over month returns than ETH, BSV, LTC, BCH, and ETC (23.21%); RVN showed the lowest month-over-month returns in the report (14.71%).

For greater graphical clarity, see this additional chart tracking only the month-over-month changes in the prices of BTC, ETH, gold, and the S&P 500:

Volatility: Ramp-Up

While crypto volatility had generally been trending downward ahead of the recent rally, the rally itself appeared to reverse this trend. BTC’s 30-day historical volatility kicked off July at 27.15%; by July 25th, it had fallen to 15.56%; by August 3rd, it had risen to 33.34%.

By looking at the 30-day historical volatilities of ETH, BCH, LTC, BSV, ETC, and RVN as a percentage of BTC’s 30-day historical volatility, we can see that BTC’s volatility summarily trumped those of altcoins from July 26th, the point of BTC’s rally, onward.

Price Correlations: The DeFi Apex?

The noteworthy story in this month’s correlation data is that ETH saw an atypically low correlation with other cryptocurrencies, including BTC. Some market participants may view this as validation that ETH-specific market factors like the rise of decentralized finance as an Ethereum-based sector and the coming move to staking in Ethereum 2.0 are making ETH an asset on its own terms rather than something that merely follows BTC.

See the full SFOX crypto correlations matrix below:

All cryptocurrency prices are denominated in USD unless otherwise noted.

Note that data collection for RVN began on February 2nd of this year, which is why RVN is not yet featured in all data analyses. RVN is also denominated in USD for ease of analysis and comparison with other crypto assets, though most RVN trading currently happens in the RVN/BTC pair.

We use two different in-house volatility indices in creating these reports:

1. 30-day historical volatility (HV) indices are calculated from daily snapshots over the relevant 30-day period using the formula:

30-Day HV Index = σ(Ln(P1/P0), Ln(P2/P1), …, Ln(P30/P29)) * √(365)

2. Daily historical volatility (HV) indices are calculated from 1440 snapshots over the relevant 24-hour period using the formula:

Daily HV Index = σ(Ln(P1/P0), Ln(P2/P1), …, Ln(P1440/P1439))* √(1440)

S&P 500 performance data are collected from Yahoo! Finance using GSPC (S&P 500 Index) data. Gold performance data are collected from Yahoo! Finance using GC=F (June 2020 gold futures contract) data.

30-day asset correlations are calculated using the Pearson method, in accordance with the following formula:

In our calculations, x = 30-day returns for BTC/USD, y = 30-day returns for the other asset in consideration, and r = the correlation coefficient between BTC and the other asset in consideration.

The crypto asset data sources aggregated for crypto prices, correlations, and volatility indices presented and analyzed in this report are the following eight exchanges, the order-book data of which we collect and store in real time:

bitFlyer

Binance

Bitstamp

Bittrex

Coinbase

Gemini

itBit

Kraken

Our indices’ integration of data from multiple top liquidity providers offers a more holistic view of the crypto market’s minute-to-minute movement. There are two problems with looking to any single liquidity provider for marketwide data:

Different liquidity providers experience widely varying trade volumes. For example: according to CoinMarketCap, Binance saw over $20 billion USD in trading volume in November 2018, whereas Bitstamp saw $2 billion USD in trading volume in that same time — an order-of-magnitude difference. Therefore, treating any single liquidity provider’s data as representative of the overall market is myopic. Liquidity providers routinely experience interruptions in data collection. For instance, virtually every exchange undergoes regularly scheduled maintenance at one point or another, at which point their order books are unavailable and they therefore have no market data to collect or report. At best, this can prevent analysts from getting a full picture of market performance; at worst, it can make it virtually impossible to build metrics such as historical volatility indices.

Building volatility indices that collect real-time data from many distinct liquidity providers mitigates both of these problems: collecting and averaging data from different sources prevents any single source from having an outsized impact on our view of the market, and it also allows us to still have data for analysis even if one or two of those sources experience interruptions. We use five redundant data collection mechanisms for each exchange in order to ensure that our data collection will remain uninterrupted even in the event of multiple failures."
