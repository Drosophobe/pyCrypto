Bitcoin (BTC) price changes are volatile due to many reasons, such as its specially different perceived values by public and high profile losses. In this article, we focus on one of its major factor, BTC news articles’ influences. Due to the past momentum of BTC and a huge portion of BTC market among the cryptocurrency market, a massive group of BTC players have already existed. However, an analytically quantitative methodology to make decisions in this market is still lacking, so we endeavored to help with this situation based on machine learning algorithms here.

Utilizing various vanilla supervised machine learning algorithms and exploring semi-supervised algorithms, we built a model to predict whether a certain news article will cause an apparent BTC price increase or decrease to help BTC players to make a more reasonable decision on selling or buying BTC.

Our project is roughly split into three major parts, financial data processing, news articles processing, and final prediction models. Can’t wait to go through the whole process now!

Financial Data processing

We scraped BTC second-by-second datasets from 01/01/2018 to 04/o1/2018 on Kaggle, which consists of the following information after being converted to a day-based dataset.

According to the stock market’s rule of thumb, an obvious change of stock price is defined as price fluctuation more than 2 standard deviations of past 30 days’ rolling average price, but there is no generally acknowledged definition of distinct BTC price change. And due to the dramatically and constantly changing BTC price, it is hard to test which number of standard deviations the most distinct one. Therefore, we use the same 2 standard deviations as in the stock market for BTC. The code is as the follows,

Basic math equation of calculating 2 standard deviations

Based on the metric, we got and marked the dates with obvious BTC price change in our selected period. Then we divided the dates into three groups, first group with distinct price increases, which has namely positive markers (Date: 3/19/2018), and second with distinct price decreases and positive markers (Dates: 2/5/2019, 3/15/2019, 3/17/2019, 3/18/2019), and another trivial one with price changes within 2 standard deviations.

Now we move on to the second part, news articles’ data processing. The logic of these two parts’ connection will be elaborated at the third part.

News articles

We used news API (the following keys are available to use) to extract news articles within the same specified date range as in the first part.

Available News API keys

The contents extracted from news articles are shown in the following form,

News articles’ extracted contents

As the lead of news articles always contains the most important information, and there are many readers who only skim the introductory paragraph, so for the content column, we only extracted the lead of news articles.

We regard the top 100 most frequently appearing words (the lemmatization and stemming are done and stop words are deleted at first) in all the extracted article’s introductory paragraphs as our corpora, and we deem them most relevant to BTC trading and price, so if a news article does not mention any of these keywords in the first 300 words, we deem this article irrelevant to BTC and then exclude it from our to-be-explored articles. (The first 300 words is the main idea of a news article concluded by empirical analysis and we do not choose introductory paragraph is because sometimes the lead is fewer than 300 words and we want to cover more articles),

The following is part of the 100 words.

Words of top occurrences in news articles

Matched with the above three date groups, the news articles are also separated into three groups. Among the three, the two groups with distinct price changes are our focus.

Then we processed our features, until now, we have got the author and publisher of each article. To convert the textual data into numeric one, first, we ranked authors and publishers according to the number of articles they released among our selected articles, and then by seeing the distribution of the number of articles, we divided the authors and publishers into five groups numbered 1 to 5 to make each group roughly have the same population.

The reason why we did not simply categorize the authors and publishers is that only tree-based algorithms like Random Forest can recognize categoric numbers, while non-tree based algorithms such as SVM will take the categoric number as some meaningful numeric numbers, which will highly influence the model’s accuracy.

Sentiment Analysis

There is a pretty important property of news article, the prevailing emotions expressed in them. Plenty of organizations have worked on the sentiment analysis of news articles, such as Microsoft’s Azure, Google’s Cloud Natural Language API and python’s NLTK package as well.

We have explored Google’s API and Azure, it turned out that Google’s works the better in our model after both were compared with our own judgments of the emotions in articles. In many pieces of researches, Google’s API also has the highest accuracy among all the tools.

To use Google API or Azure, you have to get authentication, the detailed setup process to conduct sentiment analysis in Python can be referred to https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data

The results that Google API gave have 4 columns, we only use two of them, one is score, the other one is magnitude. Score corresponds to the overall negative, neutral or positive emotions, ranging from -1 to 1. -1 means completely negative mood, while 1 is a positive extreme, and 0 means neutral emotion. The other extents of overall emotions vary between -1 and 1. Score has been normalized, which means that the number of news article’s words will not influence this number. Magnitude measures the overall strength of both positive and negative emotions. Unlike score, magnitude is not normalized, so it is proportional to article’s length and it ranges from 0 to +inf. For example, if an author in an article expressed both strong positive and negative emotions which canceled off positive one, the overall emotion delivered in that article will be neutral. However, magnitude counts all the cumulative emotions, so the final number of score might be 0, but magnitude is more than 3 or whatever big number.

The following are some examples given by Google,

Examples of sentiment judgment

(Exhaustive documentation can be found in

https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/basics#interpreting_sentiment_analysis_values)

To avoid the problem that the number of words in news article will influence the number of magnitude, we also normalized it.

TF-IDF Exploration

In a group of news article, some important words may appear many times in a certain news article while with few occurrences in the other news articles. The repeated presences will intensify the visual effects while readers are reading through an article, and thus readers are more likely to respond to these articles. TF-IDF score just helps us measure the influences well. TF-IDF which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Data Frequency is the product of two parts.

The first part is Term Frequency, it calculates the frequency of every word in a document (in our study it is a news article) in a corpus with an equation,

n_i,j means the number of times a word i appears in a document j, the denominator is the total number of words in document j.

The second part is Inverse Data Frequency, its use is to calculate the weight of rare words across all our documents (all the news articles) as the follows,

N is the total number of documents, df_t is the number of documents which contain word t. Therefore, the words that rarely appear in all the documents but only in a small number of them will a high IDF score due to a low value of df_t.

Finally, we got TF-IDF score by multiplying the above two parts.

so if word i appears many times in a news article but seldom in other news article leading to a high TF-IDF score, we can conclude that this word is significant in this article. After deleting stop words, We deem words with high TF-IDF score as important words in the news, so we averaged the 5 highest IF-IDF score to measure the visual effects. The calculated result is basically shown like,

TF-IDF calculation result

Cheers! With all the food washed and condiments mixed, the only left task is to pour into the pot and boil. Let’s check out the prediction models now!

Prediction

Supervised Algorithms

We have totally 5 features in our model, which are publisher, author, sentiment score, sentiment magnitude score and TD-IDF score, the data is like

Prediction model’s five features

The predicted data are binary numbers. If the predicted value is 0, the news article is supposed to be not influential in the BTC market and will not cause distinct price change. Otherwise, this news article will give rise to obvious price change. And the results instantly released on our BTC app can be referred by BTC investors to decide whether to buy or sell, the prompt reactions of investors can help them save or earn a reasonable amount of money.

How precise the prediction is is tested by two metrics. First, we used the traditional metric, accuracy, to test it. Besides, we also drew ROC curve of those algorithms which have built-in probability calculation function and displayed AUC score of each ROC curve. The reason why we also explored ROC-AUC metric is that we desired to pay more attention to the positive result, 1. If the BTC players see 1 in most of that day’s news articles, they will gain the information that the BTC price will be highly probable to increase, and thus buy more BTC to speculate in it. However, if the price actually decreases rather than increases, the buyers will take a considerable cost to cover the loss. On the contrary, if the price is predicted to decrease, but in reality increase, the sellers’ loss will be relatively small compared with the buyers’ reaction. In summary, the positive is more valuable to look at due to its property of high cost. From both accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics, we can find the best-performing algorithm.

We used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Perceptron and XGBoost to predict. The accuracy results are listed below,

Comparison of tranning and test accuracy

It can be seen that Random Forest is the most impressive algorithm with both highest training and test accuracy among the 6 algorithms.

And ROC-AUC yielded the same conclusion with the largest AUC score out of all the other algorithms,

ROC-AUC of Random Forest

Semi-supervised Algorithms

In the real situation, it is hard to collect massive data as expected, so we came up with the idea to explore semi-supervised algorithms to leverage only part of the approachable data to generate more self-labeling data and then conduct the prediction.

The present semi-supervised learning area has already been developed into a well-established system of knowledge, so I am not going to tell the details of it here. Basically, there are three kinds of semi-supervised learning, active learning, pure transductive learning and transductive learning with plenty of models. Projects with different datasets’ characteristics and ultimate goals should be matched with the proper semi-supervised models. Because our model’s objective function is not convex, we chose to use Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM).

We utilized 100 labeled samples and 1014 unlabeled ones to predict 478 unlabeled test samples. Finally, TSVM got 67% accuracy. Compared to 60% by using supervised algorithm SVM, TSVM shows improvements, which is basically the main use of semi-supervised learning while constrained by a limited dataset.

Comparison of SVM and TSVM

We also made an effort to check out graph-based model, Label Propagation. The methodology of it can be simplified as the following picture,

Graph-based semi-supervised model

However, one of the key input datasets is the labeled data given by experts, which is aimed to constantly improve the labels but we are in a lack of, so in the future, we will dig deeper into this method and try to look for some useful output from it.

Future exploration and reflection

Although our model has rendered a satisfying result, there are still some potential problems needed to be considered. The one that has already popped up is associated with Neural Network which we want to explore in the future.

Within the constraints of the Paradigm NLP formulation(s), Neural Networks (NN’s) can extract information contained in the article at present time, but they cannot extract information associated with future events. That is to say, and as an example, if I am a citizen of Israel and I read that someone-that-matters was assassinated, then being an informed reader with a grasp of not only history but also of retaliatory capabilities, I can infer the consequences of such an act — say economic and/or military retaliation. On the other hand, a complete outsider would read the same article and only gather that someone was assassinated and that this person mattered enough to be written about. NN’s are like the latter.

So we have to figure out if there are ways to get around the gap between the sophisticated readers and the naive readers — but based on ML formulations/approaches.

And for future application, we plan to develop a chatbot to automate our prediction display. The prototype interface is

Prototype interface of Chatbot

It generally has three parts, a chat window for asking questions, real-time BTC price chart for reference and news articles with labels of author and publisher, as well as sentiment score, magnitude and TF-IDF score."

2018 was a crazy year for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as markets dropped significantly in value, but there were still plenty of sensational headlines to capture attention in a period when digital currency news coverage changed drastically. According to statistics from Cryptocompare and alternative research from other sources, media crypto narratives have evolved rapidly.

The Top 5 Crypto Blogs According to Algorithmically Ranked Data

Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies still made headlines in 2018 within the financial technology space. Last year, coverage changed markedly throughout the industry with a bunch of new blogs and individual reporters attempting to cover the space. For instance, the algorithmically ranked data site Detailed ranks 50 cryptocurrency-focused news outlets, with the rankings updated every 24 hours. Detailed utilizes far more advanced web crawling and ranking techniques than can be found from sorting through Alexa traffic and Google Pagerank.

The web portal Detailed uses software called the 8-bitbot, an extremely detailed web crawler that combs cryptocurrency blog ratings and measures the number of followers. According to the website’s algorithmic rankings, the top five digital asset news outlets comprise Coindesk, Cointelegraph, CCN, the Ethereum Blog, and news.Bitcoin.com. The lower bracket of news outlets had much fewer mentions throughout the last six weeks of link data.

Exposing Paid Content

Last year also saw sponsored coverage exposed including promotional ICO posts. Breaker Magazine’s Corin Faife reported in October that more than half of all crypto news publications tested took money to publish undisclosed promotional material. Out of 22 crypto news outlets, 12 said they would publish paid content without disclosing to readers that it was promotional. Two outlets explained they would do it “under certain conditions” and prices for the paid material were quoted between $240 to a high of $4,500 per published request. Faife’s report concludes that many of the news organizations are high traffic websites that rank near the top of Google’s news results. One news publication removed a staff member after Breaker Magazine’s evidence was published.

Trading and Market Headlines Increase

Another study published on Jan. 16 by the analytical data website Cryptocompare shows a significant amount of news coverage changes last year. Using the company’s API, the firm collected metadata from 64,605 articles from 25 news sites throughout 2018. One chart shows how the subjects “bitcoin” and “blockchain” dominated the leading categories of news coverage. Other topics such as trading, mining, ICO, sponsored, exchanges and wallets saw much slimmer coverage.

Cryptocompare Research executive Charlie Humberstone explains in the recent study that trading and market commentary increased in 2018. “As ever, the volatile cryptocurrency markets were a topic of great interest to readers and garnered a large share of news coverage — Despite falling prices, the number of articles about crypto trading and market commentary actually increased as the year progressed,” Humberstone’s research details.

Bitcoin-Related Articles Dominated 2018

Even though there have been enormous amounts of hype surrounding altcoins and tokens over the last two years, the subject of bitcoin has regained dominance. The author remarks that bitcoin-related articles reached a peak of 42 percent by the end of 2018 but blockchain-related material remained prevalent. Digital currency news will continue to trend in 2019 while the way it is portrayed and reported on will evolve further. The bear market has affected some publications, according to Humberstone’s research, as the number of crypto articles dropped considerably from its peak in May 2018.

The cryptocurrency markets have produced a slight retracement in response to bitcoin core (BTC) testing a long-term descending trendline dating back to December 2017’s record highs. The dip has seen bitcoin cash (BCH) slip back below $150, and BTC fail to hold above $4,000. As of this writing, ripple (XRP) has again overtaken ethereum (ETH) to rank as the largest altcoin by market cap.

Combined Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization Loses $11.5 Billion in One Day

The cryptocurrency markets have pulled back following BTC forming a third point of contact with a major descending trendline stemming from the record highs posted nearly 25 months ago.

At approximately 01:00 EDT, BTC fell by nearly 6% within an hour. The move reversed all gains generated by the spike above $4,000 that was posted on Jan. 6, sending uncertainty across the markets.

As of this writing, BTC has a market cap of nearly $66.81 billion and a market dominance of 52.5%. BTC is currently trading for $3,860 on Bitfinex and $3,775 on Bitstamp. The retracement saw the combined capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fall by more than $11.5 billion, dropping from nearly $138.9 billion to $127.1 billion currently.

BCH Loses 15% in Seven Hours

Of the leading markets, BCH was among the hardest hit, shedding 15% against the dollar in just seven hours.

As of this writing, BCH is priced just below $140, the lowest the market has traded since Dec. 20. When measuring against BTC, BCH has fallen by 10% in the last seven hours and is currently trading for 0.036 BTC.

BCH is currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency market with a capitalization of $2.44 billion. BCH has a market dominance of roughly 1.9%.

XRP and ETH Vie for Second Largest Market Cap

As of this writing, XRP is the second largest cryptocurrency market with a capitalization of $14.16. XRP currently comprises 11.05% of the total cryptocurrency capitalization.

Ripple was among the least heavily hit markets by today’s bloodshed, falling 9% in the last seven hours to trade for $0.35 and 3.7% in the last 12 hours against BTC to currently trade for roughly 90,500 satoshis.

XRP was able to dethrone ETH as the second largest crypto market after ETH fell by 12% in less than eight hours to currently trade for $134. When measuring against BTC, ETH fell by 6.5% to trade for nearly 0.035 BTC.

ETH is currently the third largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $14.01 billion and a market dominance of 10.95%.

The volume of the crypto market dropped from $15 billion to $13 billion as the Bitcoin price fell below the $3,600 mark. There was a buzz of concern among analysts regarding the declining volume of digital assets and concerned regarding the potential fall of cryptocurrencies without significant sell pressure from bears.

Generally, at least until digital currencies overcome the last phase of a 12-month long bear market and start a strong accumulation phase, traders and investors in the space of digital currency expect a year free of volatility. Most digital currencies are envisioned by the traders in a low price range.

What Do Experts Have To Say?

Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has driven a wave of panic among the investors. Mitch Blakeway, Head of Trading at Quantatex said, “Despite Bitcoin’s fairly limited use cases, and even though its technology may be less sophisticated when compared to some other projects, it will likely continue to remain the market leader in 2019. Bitcoin still has the reputation and the liquidity that make it preferable to other cryptos.”

Bitcoin had approached this low value earlier in December the last year as well and had had a sharp recovery soon after that. Now with its drop to $3,000 region, it may again initiate a sharp recovery with the aid of big buy walls on major cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges.

Considering the lack of momentum of cryptocurrencies and the inability of dominant digital assets in the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum to breakout of important resistance levels, cryptocurrency technical analyst DonAlt had suggested that 2019 may turn out to be a boring and a low volatile year.

“I’ve been relatively inactive this year – for one reason – there just hasn’t been too much to trade. I wouldn’t be surprised if 2019 plays out like this, boring, choppy and frustrating to trade. The worst thing you can do is force trades when your system doesn’t give you any,” the analyst said.

Will Bitcoin Recover?

Many crypto enthusiasts are positive about the market of cryptocurrency. Slowly many people are realising how cryptocurrencies work and how they are going to benefit them by involving in them and hence people will continue to invest in Bitcoin. The downfall of Bitcoin and others in the industry as well has happened several times before this. Bitcoin had fell to its lowest price in over a year in November last year, which pushed the prices of other major coins down as well. In just 12 hours, the overall cryptocurrency market cap had fallen from $210 billion to $183 billion, losing $27 billion in the process. In November last year.

Way Ahead

If Bitcoin continues to fall below $3,500 and possibly to its 12-month low at $3,122, cryptocurrencies with low market caps and daily volumes are expected to experience intensified downward price movements against both Bitcoin and the US dollar.

There has been speculation among analysts regarding the peaks of the crypto. It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will indeed be able to rise to $40,000 in the current calendar year or not.

The blockchain of Ethereum (ETH) is one of the most useful in the blockchain space, after Bitcoin. A recent analysis of the charts suggests a sharp drop in the price of ETH and the rate of its fall is much higher than the other assets. This downfall has had the investors surprised and is a matter of concern looking at where the digital asset is heading. Tron, a coin that its Chinese founder hopes will challenge the world’s major content providers, such as Facebook and YouTube has also begun to drop its value.

On the other hand, for the cryptocurrency giant Ripple, the bulls have been unable to push Ripple (XRP) above $0.33108. Currently, the bulls are attempting to scale the level again. If this latest recovery attempt fails, a cryptocurrency to drop to $0.27795 is expected.

This downfall could be because of the security loopholes in the finance ecosystem. These attributes have to be given importance for a constant recovery of the crypto market.

How The Crypto Sell Will Help Taxes

Right from Google’s ban on cryptocurrency related ads, the Bitcoin prices have run to an all month low. The volatile cryptocurrency fell by $500 within a six-hour space. If Bitcoin has been purchased and sold within the same year, the person will be taxed on short-term capital gains.

How Will This Affect India?

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are banned in India, but this drop in the crypto market might still affect the country since the second interdisciplinary committee is in favour of legalising it. With more strict rules, this news brings hopes for the cryptocurrencies to enter the Indian market right back. The committee had previously met twice, but there were still ongoing deliberations surrounding it.

“We have already had two meetings. There is a general consensus that cryptocurrency cannot be dismissed as completely illegal. It needs to be legalised with strong riders. Deliberations are on. We will have more clarity soon,” a senior official said. The committee has met twice on the issue and is likely to submit its report to the finance ministry by February 2019."
2019-01-10 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin stumbles below $4,000 in sudden overnight drop	['Kate Rooney']	"Bitcoin's struggles are continuing into 2019.

The world's largest cryptocurrency dropped 9 percent on Thursday morning to a low of $3,570.29, according to industry data site CoinDesk. The sudden and sharp drop brings bitcoin's one-year losses to more than 70 percent.

Other major cryptocurrencies struggled, too. Ether fell 15 percent while XRP dropped 9 percent, according to CoinDesk.

Analysts did not point to any particular catalyst for Thursday's cryptocurrency dip. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, said clients had been asking — but there doesn't seem to be any real reason for this drop, ""neither technical nor fundamental.""

""The one interesting thing about this movement is that it seems to be an exact reversal of the surge that happened on Sunday afternoon,"" Greenspan said. ""At this point, the gains made since the start of the year have now been reversed and we're back to a neutral 2019.""

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have failed to recover to their peaks reached around this time last year. The retail mania has certainly worn off as the entire market capitalization has dropped 85 percent in a year, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Investors had been awaiting more institutional adoption this year, and the launch of a series of bitcoin futures. Both the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE (parent company of the New York Stock Exchange) and the Nasdaq plan to launch bitcoin futures this year, despite the ongoing bear market.

So far, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates bitcoin, has approved two crypto futures products — one from the Chicago Board Options Exchange and another by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Still, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in November that he needs to see better custody solutions surveillance before he would feel ""comfortable"" allowing a crypto exchange traded fund, or ETF, to come to market.

2019-02-13 11:00:00+00:00	EOS Price Surge Relegates Litecoin From Market cap top Four	[]	"nulltx.com Reading time: ~3 m

Earlier today, all of the cryptocurrency charts looked rather bearish for a moment. That situation is slowly changing, as most of the top markets are green across the board once again. The EOS price is rising very strongly, and the currency reclaimed the #4 spot in the market cap rankings by surpassing Litecoin. A very impressive development, given all of the recent market turmoil.

Bullish EOS Momentum Gets Traders Excited

In the cryptocurrency world, there is hardly ever a boring day. Something will happen at one point or another, primarily because these markets seem to operate independently from one another more often than not. EOS Has been an interesting example in this regard, as it is currently going through a bit of an unexpected bull run. Even though Bitcoin is rising, that doesn’t always mean altcoins will follow suit.

Over the past few hours, the EOS price has risen by nearly 7% in both USD and BTC value. These are impressive developments, especially when considering how EOS quickly overtook Litecoin again in market cap. It would appear EOS is poised to hit $3 later today, although those round figures usually act as strong resistance.

It doesn’t happen all that often the crypto industry offers a feel-good story. It would appear that has happened where EOS is concerned. One user accidentally received 103,000 EOS, worth roughly $300,000. He effectively sent it back to the rightful owner, which is pretty impressive, all things considered. Not everyone would do the same if they received an erroneous payment of this magnitude.

There are amazing & honest people in the EOS community. This account https://t.co/LOGrhZx5Mb returned 103K EOS accidentally transferred to it by a token holder. We are happy to have played a role guiding the two holders but all kudos to australia123. @block_one_ #eosio pic.twitter.com/U5iRPnqv0k — EOS Authority (@EOSauthority) February 12, 2019

Secondly, it would appear there is still plenty of EOS-related development taking place behind the scenes. B1 is in the process of developing their first product to run on EOS, although not much is known about it at this time. The EOS repository also has one of the most active developer communities to date. From that point of view, things are looking good on the surface.

Not to mention B1 is currently developing their first product to run on #EOS on a private repository. Meanwhile, EOS is running well, fast, and is seeing multiple third parties developing actively on top of the EOSIO software. — Rick Schlesinger (@rschlesinger) February 12, 2019

When looking at the EOS chart itself, it quickly becomes apparent a crucial line will need to be crossed. Given the vast trading volume the altcoin generates, it seems breaking the resistance level should not pose too much of a problem. However, the quick gains can also lead to a brief drop shortly after. The coming hours will be crucial in this regard.

$EOS doing well with this trade so far. At a pretty critical resistance right now though. VPVR point of control, meaning lots of past trading at this price level. I think our volume is too low right now to break it. Either more volume or we pull back a bit. #EOS #crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/fJyG6ozxZH — The Crypto Corgi (@BCorgi12) February 12, 2019

For the neutral spectator, this EOS value increase may not necessarily make too much sense. However, it was a matter of time until Litecoin lost the #4 market cap spot, simply because the projects it overtook never lost much value over the weekend to begin with. Even so, there will be some interesting competition going on between the two, and one which speculators will thoroughly enjoy.

Monday’s events spelled the end of a peaceful week for traders, with Bitcoin’s expected average volatility expected at around 3.5 percent daily.

Analysts continue to await the end of the protracted bear market, which has characterized Bitcoin since December 2017. Price forecasts for 2019 put the largest cryptocurrency anywhere from plugging lows of $1300 to setting new all-time highs above $20,000.

“We’ve been in a bear market for a very long stretch, probably the longest in history for Bitcoin right now […] I think right now my personal view is that we are actually overshooting on the lower side now,” exchange Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told a conference last week.

January 26 marked the three-year anniversary of one of Bitcoin’s best-known ‘obituaries.’ Coming from ex-developer Mike Hearn, the 2016 blog post describes Bitcoin as “failed.” At the time, BTC/USD traded at $310.

“It has failed because the community has failed,” he concluded.

Since then, Bitcoin has chalked up a total of 342 such ‘obituaries,’ with 91 deaths in 2018 alone. This year, however, only three have appeared in January since the date of its tenth anniversary.

2018 was a wild ride for cryptocurrencies. Despite the many ups and downs experienced by Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrency vendors, the market has proven that it is going to stick around for the long haul.

Though there is still risk involved in cryptocurrency, investors are coming to better understand the challenges and opportunities associated with this exciting sector. As a result, more people are entering the crypto trading sphere than ever before.

If you’re still new to the crypto investing scene, however, the sheer number of investing options — and new terminology — can feel overwhelming. By taking steps to better understand what you’re getting into, you will make wiser investment decisions.

Here are some tips to get you started on the right track:

1) Know the relation between market cap and circulating supply

New cryptocurrency investors may be intimidated by the new vocabulary they need to learn and how these different terms affect pricing. For example, the “market cap” for a particular coin is used to determine the total value of coins on the market. This number is determined by multiplying the coin’s circulating supply by its current price.

The use of the circulating supply, rather than the total supply, is an important distinction. For a variety of reasons, some coins are not available on the public market. Because they aren’t available for trading, they are not counted toward price considerations or the market cap.

2) Keep up with current market conditions

You can read articles debating the pros and cons of various cryptocurrencies, but current market data will always be the most reliable source for identifying trends and making smarter trading decisions.

Fortunately, there are several websites dedicated to providing up-to-the-minute updates regarding changes in price, supply and market cap. Coincap, CoinMarketCap, and CryptoCompare are just a few examples of resources that help investors stay up to date on current prices. Data that is updated in real-time is paired with charts tracking changes over 24-hour and seven-day periods to give investors a better idea of current trends.

3) Follow the leaders

Even when you have real-time data available, making a trading decision based on a “top 100 cryptocurrencies” list can be intimidating.

However, when this data is paired with guidance from top investors, you can have greater confidence in your decisions and even learn a few extra pointers along the way.

Sites like eToro utilize what is known as a “social trading” program that allows top investors to share their knowledge and trading practices.

New investors can use these traders as a guiding reference or even fully match their investment strategies as they learn the ropes. Picking up good habits early on in your investing journey will keep you from making the impulsive decisions that can lead to disaster.

4) Diversification is vital for success

As with traditional investment opportunities, diversification is essential if you wish to come out a financial winner in cryptocurrencies. With a more diversified portfolio, you reduce your overall risk, especially if you invest in coins and tokens that service different sectors.

This also means you should continue to invest in non-crypto spheres. These practices maximize your potential return while alleviating the risk should a particular coin or stock go under.

You can keep your coins organized and protected with a cryptocurrency wallet. These digital wallets serve as a centralized hub for receiving and sending crypto transactions. Keeping your diversified investments locked in a secure wallet will make it easier to keep track of your investments.

5) Understand which factors influence pricing

What causes cryptocurrency prices to rise and fall? Though supply and demand certainly play a role, crypto investors should carefully consider the perceived utility of a cryptocurrency. If a coin is perceived as having several practical applications, it will be more highly sought-after, and therefore, increase in price.

As MyCryptopedia explains, mining difficulty is another major factor that affects pricing: “A higher mining difficulty means that it is harder to mine an additional unit of a coin. This can have an impact on a coin’s perceived value, and subsequently, its price, as increasing a coin’s supply will require more computing power to be used in the mining process.”

Savvy investors should also pay attention to news headlines regarding different coins and tokens. Positive or negative articles will often have a direct correlation on future pricing trends.

6) Research individual coins and tokens

Cryptocurrencies have frequently been called out as nothing more than a scam by skeptical individuals. While many crypto products have proven themselves to be worthwhile investments, other tokens and coins have indeed been scams, some of which have cost investors millions of dollars.

While this isn’t much of a risk with any of the major, better-known cryptocurrencies, anyone considering investing in a new coin or token should do thorough research before making a trade.

By understanding how a coin will operate within the market, you can determine whether or not it is a legitimate opportunity — and if it is legitimate, you can likely identify whether it will actually be a good investment.

In addition to researching market news, resources like All Crypto Whitepapers can greatly assist your investigative efforts. This site collects all documents highlighting cryptocurrencies’ technical details, marketing plans and more so you can better understand what they have to offer.

7) Prepare for volatility

No one can predict what the market will do with 100 percent accuracy — and this is perhaps truer of cryptocurrency than any other investment sector. Panicking over day to day changes in the market value won’t do you much good. You’re more likely to rush into an impulsive decision and make a trade you’ll later regret.

The stock market provides valuable lessons for handling this volatility, as global stock markets are no stranger to sudden rises and falls in pricing. As such, many traditional lessons and tips for handling volatility are just as applicable to crypto investors.

Many of these practices highlight the value of long-term investments by focusing on a future reward rather than daily price fluctuations. Even short-term investors need to exercise a bit of patience and look at the bigger picture. Understanding that volatility is part of crypto investing, but that you should still experience great growth in the long run, will help you make wiser decisions.

Cryptocurrency trading is expected to increase by 50 percent in 2019 alone.

Despite the seemingly never-ending claims that crypto is a “fad” or already dead, it is clear that this investment option is here to stay. By becoming an informed investor now, you can stay ahead of the curve and be better prepared for future market shifts."

He Has Over A Decade Of Experience Writing About Technology', 'Has Been Covering The Blockchain', 'Cryptocurrency Space Since He Has Also Interviewed A Few Prominent Experts Within The Cryptocurrency Space.']	"Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.

During the last 24 hours, the top cryptocurrency- Bitcoin falls around $3,640 prior to recovering slightly. Currently, it shows zero movements about the day and is trading at $3,665. It seems that the condition remains the same as it was yesterday. Considering, the ratio in crypto market from last Saturday, Bitcoin gets dump over $3,550 prior to recovering to reach the same level again.

On the other hand, Ethereum is not a big deal as it seems to drop back slowly. Currently, it shows above $120, however, this is for ETH to lose severe percent on the day. Moreover, the gap within Ethereum and Ripple XRP is widening over $700 million, meanwhile, the Ripple token is going flat.

Today, the cryptocurrencies in top ten remain all red operating with the Asian trading session in Crypto market . however, losses seem fractions of a percent. Most trending coin Tron is also dropping the most with around 4% on the day. Despite it saw a huge success of its first day of niTROn summit held in San Francisco. The rest of the coins are seen declining less than a percent on the day.

There are only four cryptocurrencies showing green signal in the top 20 ranking according to CoinMarketCap at the time of writing. They are Iota, NEO, Ethereum Classic and making showing a little progress today. However, Maker improves only by a percent or two. Also, the rest are seen all in red by a fraction making slight movement as compared to the levels yesterday.

On the other hand, TenX ranks the FOMO chart considering the top one hundred at the time with a surge over 50%.

2019-01-18 00:00:00+00:00	Is Crypto Volatility an Opportunity or Risk?	[]	"Although cryptocurrency markets appear to have calmed down, fluctuations are still the largest among major financial markets. The average daily movement in the last two months has been 4.1 percent.

Catalysts include regulations, system problems, stock market trends and an increase in participants and products. The market reacted the most to stock market trends, followed by system problems such as the hard fork.

Although cryptocurrency also fell as expected in mid-December when the U.S. stock market was hit by a panicked selling, there later emerged a reverse correlation where Bitcoin (BTC) was bought when U.S. equities or the U.S. dollar fell. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency market no longer reacted as much to news such as regulation reinforcement or any increase/decrease in market participants.

The current movement strongly resembles the first cryptocurrency boom and crash in 2013. At that time, prices fell 80 percent from their highs and then took a year and a half to revive. For the time being, the focus will be on monetary easing and the U.S. stock market trends, the start of BTC futures trading by the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Bakkt, approval of the cryptocurrency ETF in the U.S. and progress of various tokenizations.

One Year after the Boom, it Seems the Market Has Stopped Moving

One year from the boom at the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency market cap is $123 billion. That’s about 80 percent below its December 2017 peak. In particular, it seems that movements have completely stopped in the two months since the drop due to Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) hard fork (change in specifications) in mid-November (Figure 1).

However, this is because the previous range was simply to wide. Even today, cryptocurrency is still the most volatile asset, compared with other financial assets. The number of coin types has increased by more than 50 percent in one year. There are currently 2,111 types and the number continues to grow (CoinMarketCap).

The average daily fluctuation rate over the past two months is 4.1 percent, greatly exceeding even the Turkish Lira (Figure 2-1). Moreover, movement is not only in the downward direction. The maximum rate of increase was 12 percent, a similar figure to the decline of 14 percent (Figure 2-2). This rise was due to positive factors such as the release of blockchain-related products by Amazon.com (AMZN) and BCH’s hard-fork problem convergence. Moreover, in December, following the U.S. stock market selloff, there were days when cryptocurrency prices rose 5-10 percent.

Equity Swings Were the Biggest Factor Impacting the Crypto Market

Currently, what are the factors influencing the cryptocurrency market? The days of great cryptocurrency price movements were extracted, and based on the daily news flow, factors were classified as follows: regulations, system problems, stock-market trends, market participants and product increase/decrease. As seen in Figure 3, the price fluctuation range compared to the previous day for each factor was totaled (absolute value, namely, the scale of decline was also totaled as a positive number). The results show that the market responded most to the stock-market trends.

At the beginning of December, there were days when cryptocurrency declined along with stocks in a panicky risk-off mood. However, in the past one month, movements to buy cryptocurrency were conspicuous when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell (Figure 4).

Following stock market trends, the next kind of factor moving the cryptocurrency market was system problems. Especially around this time, the BCH issue mentioned earlier and large-scale updates of Ethereum (ETH) were major factors. However, the market hardly responded to small-scale challenges such as the recent 51 percent attack on Ethereum Classic (ETC), reported by media on January 7, and the hacking of the New Zealand exchange, reported on January 16.

Regulatory news had an additional impact. For instance, BTC rose 4.5 percent when the media reported that the FSA may consider a cryptocurrency ETF on January 7. This report later proved incorrect, pushing down prices by 5.6 percent.

There was a mixed reaction to new participants and products entering the market. Some investors reacted positively to news of a booming ETH-based blockchain game. But the market remained more or less unresponsive to negative news like the contraction of China’s BTC mining giant Bitmain. This was expected to a certain extent.

What are the price catalysts now?

With prices falling this far, it is not easy to become bullish. Still, one ray of hope is the crash and revival seen after the first cryptocurrency boom before the Mt. Gox incident in 2013. As shown in Figure 5, the current cryptocurrency movement resembles the decline after the first big rally. At that time, BTC revived dramatically after sliding 80 percent from its high, and enduring a 1-1/2 year slump.

For the time being, the focus will be on the financial policies and stock market movements in the U.S. Even if the U.S. Federal Reserve stops interest-rate hikes earlier. A weak U.S. stock market could also draw money back to cryptocurrencies.

In addition, the market could see more participants and attention when Bakkt’s BTC futures begin trading. The prospect of a cryptocurrency-related ETF is another catalyst to watch. We also need to keep an eye on the trend toward tokenization. It’s become popular to sell real estate and unlisted stock in small lots via tokens. If these markets become active, cryptocurrency investors will increase and practical uses will become more clear.

Depending on how these trends play out, the revival of the cryptocurrency market is not just a dream."
2019-01-24 00:00:00+00:00	Blockchain: How the Fourth Industrial Revolution can help accelerate progress towards development	[]	"Blockchain has been called a pillar of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, comparing it to technologies such as the steam engine and the internet that triggered previous industrial revolutions. It has the power to disrupt existing economic and business models and may prove particularly valuable in emerging market economies. According to experts, blockchain also holds great promise as a method of fighting corruption, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, where more smartphone penetration can facilitate the adoption of new technology.

But what is it? Simply put, a blockchain is a chain of digital blocks that contain information. Once the information has been created, it is very difficult to change. It includes information about the sender, the receiver, and the amount of currency. The data is trustworthy because it is bound in a strict framework of rules and cryptographic keys, and only people with the right key can access or modify the data. Blockchain also removes the need for an intermediary, such as a bank or a lawyer. In short, it facilitates transparency, which is the enemy of corruption.

Blockchain has been used for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but many other possible uses are emerging, such as energy markets, digital identity, supply chain, health care and financial services. But there is one especially important for Latin America and the Caribbean: fighting corruption.

The impact of corruption

Corruption has a disproportionate impact on the poor and most vulnerable, increasing costs and reducing access to services, including health, education and justice, according to the World Bank. Corruption also impedes investment, with consequent effects on growth and jobs. According to a Transparency International survey, more than half of Latin Americans said that their government is failing to address corruption, and one in three people who had used a public service in the last 12 months said they had to pay a bribe.

Studies have shown that the poor pay the highest percentage of their income in bribes. In Paraguay, the poor pay 12.6 percent of their income to bribes while high-income households pay 6.4 percent. The lack of anonymity and the traceability of blockchain makes corruption more difficult than with traditional money. For example, if a government decides to construct a road, it could track how each dollar is being spent, identify all the users of the funds, and ensure that only those authorized to spend money do so on originally intended expenses. Fraud and corruption investigations that normally take months could be performed instantaneously. This type of financial tracking could be a deterrent for bribes in the public sector, in turn increasing development impact.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, only half of adults have access to banking services, however 90% of unbanked adults have a mobile phone. As smartphone penetration continues to grow, the popularity of virtual currencies is also growing. In Brazil, some companies and retail stores are accepting virtual currencies as payment. Colombia is also growing its presence in the cryptocurrency market in Latin America, as is Peru.

Chile also has a very active cryptocurrency community, but banks have been rejecting services to crypto-related companies and users. Both Chile and Argentina have been hosting cryptocurrency events and meetings. In Chile, LaBitConf has attracted thousands of participants from all over the world interested in digital assets. In Argentina, Bitcoin continues to grow as well, and there are no major regulations threatening the industry. However, Bolivia and Ecuador are two of a few countries in the world in which Bitcoin is strictly banned.

The World Bank Group is working to ensure that economies in developing countries can harness these kinds of innovation to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. In August of 2018, the World Bank launched bond-i, a blockchain operated new debt instrument, the world’s first bond to be created, allocated, transferred and managed through its life cycle using blockchain.

In Colombia, where low-resource and at-risk youth lack access to quality education and are often disincentivized to stay in school to complete a formal curriculum, the World Bank is exploring the opportunity to support youth education through social gaming, where they can earn tokens by solving global challenges.

The World Bank is also working on using blockchain to bring more transparency to supply chains. For example, blockchain could encourage farmers and the intermediaries who stand between farms and mills to enter more data about produce as it moves through the chain.

This Fourth Industrial Revolution can help accelerate progress towards development by helping prevent fraud and corruption. Yet the technology is in its early stages of development and serious challenges and risks, both technical and regulatory, will need to be addressed before it achieves widespread adoption. But the road is wide open.

2019-02-27 00:00:00+00:00	How to Launch Your Own Blockchain Art Marketplace — Artnome	['Jason Bailey']	"At the time of this writing, Freeport is pre-alpha and has about a month to go before it will be ready for marketplace creation. I decided to include it anyway because it offers a really nice counterpart to the Pixura platform.

Freeport is the brainchild of Joe Looney, the developer behind Rare Pepe Wallet. Joe is creating Freeport as a completely open-source solution (MIT License), so if you are technical, you can use all the code to do whatever want with it. But Freeport is specifically designed with less technical people in mind. With just a little Bitcoin, from a single interface you will be able to:

Create your asset (CounterParty)

Upload your art (Imgur)

Attach it to the asset (CounterParty)

Search a directory (DigiRare.com)

Put orders up to sell through the DEX (decentralized exchanged)

Joe has brilliantly structured Freeport to use several existing best-in-class, off-the-shelf solutions, including Imgur, CounterParty, and DigiRare. These decisions were born out of necessity to simplify maintenance and upkeep (Joe is building Freeport for fun in his free time), but this strategy may turn out to be Freeport’s greatest strength. As Joe puts it:

The Bitcoin blockchain is good at creating scarce digital assets (via Counterparty) and then allowing the uncensorable transfer of them. It is not good for storing images. Even with IPFS, any projects utilizing it are generally running their IPFS node for storage. The only way to guarantee that images stored via IPFS are available is to maintain a node and host them yourself, and at that point what are you really even doing? With Freeport, as the developer I don’t need to run any additional software to host images because an image hosting service (Imgur initially) will be hosting them for me. My plan is to also include options to use other hosting services and eventually allow artists to specify custom image locations. Since I am building Freeport in my free time, I don’t want the responsibility of curating questionable content. One of the problems with something like IPFS or self-hosted storage is that you, the developer, maintain that responsibility. To eliminate that additional work, I’ve leveraged a hosted storage that has its own code of conduct. It also demonstrates that “decentralized storage” is a fun thing to have, but it’s not absolutely necessary. Immutability is achieved by including a hash of the image as well as the image location (Imgur URL) as part of the asset information stored on the Bitcoin blockchain via Counterparty. If Imgur were to become unavailable, the artist has the ability to update the image location, however the hash remains unchained. This means if the artist changes the contents of the image, it is obvious from the record that it’s not the original. Imgur is great at providing the means for everyone to see the image initially and the foreseeable future. However, over time, it becomes the responsibility of the issuer and asset holders to retain the image themselves.

Looney also takes advantage of CounterParty on the back end for token issuance and Bitcorns creator Dan Anderson’s excellent DigiRare site which is designed to provide a directory to view all art and collectibles on the Bitcoin blockchain.

While Freeport is still a few weeks off from launching, you can install the beta as a Chrome browser extension and be among the first to use it when it is ready for prime time.

To install Freeport.io:

Download the Chrome extension

Go to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser.

Make sure “Developer Mode” is selected and click on ""Load Unpacked""

Select the directory ""Chrome Extension""

Be sure to follow Looney on Twitter at @wasthatawolf for updates on the additional functionality in Freeport as it becomes available.

Summary

Hopefully you found this article/tutorial helpful and you are off to the races building your own marketplace and tokenizing your own art and collectibles. I don’t think you can really do wrong by going with either Pixura or Freeport. Hopefully I have outlined the differences between the two enough that you know which one is right for you. Here is a quick summary:

Availability Pixura is live and you can launch a marketplace today Freeport is in alpha and will be ready in roughly a month

Blockchain Pixura lives on the Ethereum blockchain Freeport lives on the Bitcoin blockchain

Support Pixura provides support to paying customers Freeport: Joe provides support when he can (this is his side project)

Fees Pixura charges $25 to launch a market, $1 to launch a collectible, and takes a 3% fee for all transactions on your marketplace Freeport is a community project with zero fees

Architecture Pixura utilizes the same proprietary code used on SuperRare Freeport leverages a combination of solutions (Bitcoin, CounterParty, DigiRare, Imgur) and is open source under the MIT license



Conclusion

It is a really exciting time for those of us that have been following the development of art and collectibles on the blockchain. You no longer need to understand the complexities of writing your own smart contracts to launch your own art digital collectibles marketplace, and that should be huge in driving mainstream adoption for creators.

However, I believe the next big problem is going to be growing the number of collectors. One of the great advantages of participating in a marketplace like SuperRare as an artist is they do all the marketing for you. I think some artists may realize that putting their art “on the blockchain” does not necessarily translate to more sales. You still need to find someone interested in buying/collecting your work. And the number of people who know how to buy art using cryptocurrency is even smaller than the number of people who know how to buy art with fiat (regular currency). An increase in the number and variety of digitally scarce objects we can collect could bring in new collectors to the market, but it could also flood the market and reduce demand.

I’m optimistic that an increase in “scarce digital goods” in the gaming market could help drive adoption and understanding for the blockchain art market as well. At least in the short term, I think we’ll see a spike as people explore these new tools and innovate in ways that nobody has thought of yet. And hopefully we’ll see a bit more of the weird blockchain 1.0 spirit come back to the community.

Check out these blogs, hubs, podcasts and newsletters to stay informed on Ethereum, blockchain, and decentralization.

If you spend much time scrolling around the crypto-sphere, it might seem like everyone’s an expert, a critic, a salesman — or most often an impenetrable amalgam of all three. It’s tough to cut through the noise and get to the matter when it comes to the latest developments in Ethereum protocol, Enterprise Ethereum, and news from the greater blockchain ecosystem.

Never fear — We’re here to help!

We asked around the ConsenSys mesh to get an idea of what our developers, entrepreneurs, and creatives read on a daily basis to stay up-to-speed on the ever-changing blockchain industry. Below are 11 of our favorite blogs, resource hubs, and podcasts — all of which focus on substance over speculation and are produced by those closest to the action.

Evan Van Ness’ weekly roundup of the Ethereum ecosystem — which has been running since 2016 — is the first stop for blockchain news for many industry insiders. The website and weekly newsletter’s lo-fi, no-nonsense approach is all-killer-no-filler, and feature development updates, business news, media coverage, and a calendar of blockchain events. Be sure to check out the recently released Year in Ethereum roundup of 2018!

A weekly newsletter put forth by MIT’s Technology Review, Chain Letter is a powerful apparition in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. Its focus on wider blockchain tech is delivered with a laser on the substantive issues of the week analyzed with an academic rigor. Often a quick read, Chain Letter is packed with info and surely a healthy part of any blockchain nerd’s informational diet.

While many crypto media outlets tend towards tabloid sensationalism and clickbait headlines, Decrypt features quality reporting on the blockchain space that’s broad in scope and often delivered with a sense of humor. The Daily Debrief newsletter delivers quick hits to your inbox, and Decrypt’s fantastic Litepaper hub features in-depth explainers on every Ethereum-related topic imaginable with a vibrant and user-friendly design.

5 years and almost 300 podcasts in, it’s clear that the Epicenter weekly podcast is one of the cornerstones of blockchain media. Regularly hosting many of the most influential and accomplished people in Ethereum and the larger blockchain ecosystem, Epicenter podcasts are quite literally a primary source for what’s happening now and in the future.

EthHub’s mission is to provide a single source for all essential Ethereum information, and does so with a four-pronged informational assault. The eponymous EthHub repository holds open documentation for BUIDLing and tech, while the excellent Into the Ether podcast features deep dive conversations with some of Ethereum’s most accomplished developers. The weekly ETHHub newsletter and blog are also useful sources for news and project updates.

Founded by evacuees from the legacy journalism establishment, Breaker Mag has quickly established itself as a leading voice in the emergent culture of blockchain. Never afraid to take a stance, Breaker invites talented journalists to undertake deep dives on challenging subjects that often shine an investigative light back on the blockchain industry.

If you prefer your Ethereum news delivered live and in person, Crypt0 — AKA Omar Bham — is one of the most informed, impartial, and enthusiastic voices in all of Crypto YouTube. While most vloggers are maximalists towards a particular tech or philosophy, Crypt0’s News provides often real-time reporting on what’s happening in the world of crypto and blockchain with a balanced view.

If markets are your mojo, Messari brings transparency to the crypto-economy. It’s the Swiss Army Knife of digital asset markets, with a bountiful crypto tracker, a suite of data tools, the Crypto Intelligence’ news aggregator, and the Agora Research Community, which is a great way to connect with people, projects, and organizations in the blockchain space looking to collaborate. For the market minded, Messari’s Unqualified Opinions daily newsletter is required reading.

A more academic affair, Blockchain Library houses a deep repository of open source digital resources, source lists, and data for researchers, developers, and those curious to use for projects and reports. If you’re looking for sources or references for a paper, or just want some deep research into particular subjects like economics, law, or tech development, Blockchain Library is a great stop.

No list of Ethereum info sources would be complete without the R/Ethereum subreddit. Frequented by many of the space’s leading developers, the sub is home to some of the most vibrant and clued in discourse in all of blockchain. It would also be remiss to ignore R/ETHTrader, which is the closest thing to a global trollbox commons we’ve got, and functions as a bellwether of trends and sentiment amongst followers of the Ethereum ecosystem."

He Works In The Domain', 'Manages New Developments At Coingape. Follow Him On Twitter At']	"While Bitcoin is down over 81 percent from its peak, crypto-enthusiasts still hold a firm belief in the leading cryptocurrency. Experts are calling out a bottom to be near and a good year ahead for the crypto market.

2019 Crypto Bull Run

Bitcoin is expected to go lower than its current position at $3,670. It is a possibility the leading cryptocurrency will finally hit the bottom this year. The Bitcoin bottom call is made by Dollar Vigilante, Jeff Berwick, who believes either crypto prices have already hit the bottom or near it. Despite this, he is not bearish on Bitcoin prices and expects it to remain in a lull throughout this year.

Despite the negative bitcoin price action, this hasn’t stopped the popularity of bitcoin trading through applications like the Bitcoin Trader.

Berwick has a strong belief in crypto and believes bitcoin has the potential to gain traction of revolutionary level as he explains,

Moreover, according to the Delphi Digital firm’s research, the selling pressure is about exhausted and it is likely, the market will hit bottom in Q1 of 2019. As for the next peak, it is expected around April 17, 2020, which is based on the previous cycles.

This price appreciation line up with the block reward halving as “miner’s selling propensity is reduced.” The research also notes, “this will be the last reward halving to have a very significant impact on price.”

According to the crypto friendly investor and venture capitalist, Fred Wilson who holds shares in Twitter and Kickstarter noted that we are actually nearing a bottom,

“We are in the process of finding the bottom on the large, liquid, and lasting crypto-tokens. But I think that process could take much of 2019 to play out. I expect we will see some bullish runs, followed by selling pressures taking us back to retest the lows. I think this bottoming out process will end sometime in 2019 and we will slowly enter a new bullish phase in crypto.”

This all might seem pessimistic but according to Wilson, he is just being “incredibly optimistic” as he further discusses the catalyst for the next bull run will be “the result of some of the many promises made in 2017 coming to fruition in 2019.”

Stablecoins, NFT/crypto assets/crypto gaming, and earn/spending opportunities will see meaningful progress and consumer adoption this year, according to Wilson. He further shares that there will be pressure and bad actors will remain persistent in the market in the form of scams, hacks, failed projects, and losing investments. But these bad actors are part and parcel of the promise this nascent technology has as “Permissionless innovation produces the greatest gains over time but also comes with the inevitable bad actors and actions.”"

In the Western world, many people look at cryptocurrencies as an investment, and obsess over their price movements. In Africa, however, cryptos are much more than an investment asset class: they are transforming lives, in the financial services sector and beyond.

One of the most transformative uses for cryptocurrency and blockchain tech has been by Wala, a Ugandan crypto startup. Wala recognized the great challenge that people in Sub-Sahara experience with traditional banking and decided to do something about it. The firm uses the $Dala cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem to facilitate the swift, cheap and efficient movement of funds.

And its reach has gone far beyond just facilitating transfers. The firm has joined hands with the Prince of the Buganda kingdom in Uganda. Together, they are building a blockchain-powered clean energy program that will bring electricity to 25 percent of Ugandan households. Crypto has met Wakanda, and the result is revolutionary.

Bus Drivers and Exorbitant Fees

By now, most people know just how expensive it is to send money across the borders in Africa. The World Bank rates charges in the continent as the highest in the world. Nevertheless, people from different countries venture into their neighboring countries in search of opportunities. If they do find work, they have to send money back home to their families.

That’s when the real effect of those exorbitant charges is felt.

Wala founder Tricia Martinez explains why sending money home is a gamble. In a blog post, Tricia tells the story of Obert, an Uber driver who plies his trade in Cape Town, South Africa but hails from Zimbabwe, a neighboring country.

Obert has to send money home to his family, but the infrastructure in place is either too expensive or inaccessible. He thus has to turn to other methods, and they are as risky as they can get. One method was through bus drivers. The drivers pick up the money from Obert, and a host of others, and deliver it to Zimbabwe at an agreed time and place.

This method is quite risky. For one, Obert has to rely on the trustworthiness of the drivers. Should the drivers run with the money, there’s little he can do. The drivers could also get robbed, losing Obert his hard-earned money. As if these challenges weren’t enough, the service isn’t cheap either. Obert has to part with 7 percent of the transaction amount.

A fast, reliable, cheap and efficient funds transfer channel couldn’t come fast enough for Obert.

The Uptake

Wala launched the Dala protocol and marketplace in April 2018, and the reception was incredible. In its first 30 days, the Wala Android app was downloaded 57,000 times. The app was only available in three countries – South Africa, Zimbabwe and Uganda – making the achievement even more noteworthy. In Uganda, only Facebook and WhatsApp were downloaded more times that month.

As Tricia revealed a month later, the app had 4,400 daily active users who completed 172,000 transactions. These transactions included purchasing of airtime, paying for water and electricity bills and even paying school fees.

As testament to the huge market share that micro-transactions have in Africa, the average transaction was a mere $0.27. The app completes such micro-transactions at zero fees, giving its users further freedom to transact as they wish.

Wala uses the $Dala crypto, an ERC-20 token, to power the Dala protocol. $Dala is a multi-chain crypto which relies on Stellar, to settle transactions, and on Ethereum, for the wallet. While the two companies are related, $Dala is an open protocol and can be used to power other networks.

Transforming Uganda

While Wala is based in Cape Town, South Africa, its biggest impact has been in the East African nation of Uganda. Wala has partnered with CleanPath Emerging Markets (CPEM) and together, they are launching a blockchain-powered gigawatt-scale solar program. The program has also received the support of the Ugandan government through its Ministry of Energy.

CPEM will run its partner and vendor contracts as well as its ledger on the Dala platform, allowing Ugandans who get connected to the grid to pay for their power bills using the $Dala tokens. CPEM workers will also be paid in $Dala.

Tricia explained why this was a natural next step:

“The numbers we’ve seen since the launch of $DALA have been staggering, and a large portion of our current users are Ugandan, so this partnership is a natural next step to allow users the opportunity to further benefit from using $DALA.”

There’s one person who is at the center of this mega move: Prince Kudra Kalema of the Buganda kingdom, who has taken it upon himself to take measures that elevate his people. In an interview with TechCrunch, he revealed that such developments can only be made possible by decentralized systems such as Dala.

Having identified clean and affordable energy as what his people needed the most, he set out to find the most low-cost option. Prince Kalema is the co-founder and managing director of CPEM. Linking up with Dala was only natural as the two share a vision of a better Africa, he explained.

“We began using the $DALA protocol because it became very clear that the financial structure in Uganda was not adequate. It was clear we needed something. There is no way the Uganda shilling is stable enough for the type of program we are doing. Wala was already invested in the same country and wasn’t just about the idea of a running a crypto coin in an emerging market, but was also about creating the best type of financial institutions for the country”

With over 80 percent of Ugandans being under 35 and well-educated, technological advancements such as cryptos can take root easily. Prince Kalema believes that cryptocurrencies could take root in Uganda even more easily than in the U.S.

With cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology and an ambitious leader – the future looks bright for Uganda.

He Believes In The Future Of Digital Currency', 'Enjoys Updating The Public With Breaking News On New Developments In The Cryptocurrency Space.', 'Contact', 'Adrian.Klent', 'At']	"Advertisement

The cryptocurrency market has taken a rather impressive turn since the last 24hrs when most tokens and coins were only making a little above 2% to 4% in gains, but as usual, the unpredictable structure of the market has moved to a more trading friendly position as more and more tokens continue to attain gains.

It is interesting to note that at press time, only 13 coins/tokens are raking in losses, all of which are between 0.10% to 7%. Not only is this current market pattern favorable enough to keep prices on a more stabilized state, but most of the top ten altcoins are also likely to go as far as making a breakout in trading price as trading volume continued to skyrocket.

ETHER

Beginning with Ether, ZyCrypto reported on the possibility of the token surpassing its long term rival XRP to retain the second spot as its market capitalization was heading towards a collision with that of the XRP. Interestingly, that is still the case at the moment of this writing.

Ether seems to have stabilized, and the only difference between now and the last 24hrs is that Ether has moved from $13.10 billion to $13.58 billion against Ripple’s XRP whose market cap of $13.64 as of yesterday has only moved slightly upwards to sit at $13.79 billion at the moment of this writing.

Not only is this good news for Ether traders, seeing that yesterday’s decline of 4% did not deter the token from going up by 10%, the next 24hrs will carry Ether traders on an exciting journey as the token has even gone ahead to break its nearest resistance level to now trade at $130 at press time.

Meanwhile, a few other altcoins like BCH and EOS have followed Ether’s path with gains of 8.74% and 9.76% respectively. This current increase in gains has further positioned both tokens for a highly possible breakout in trading price as both have gradually maintained stability since yesterday. Currently, BCH is trading at $135.98, while 1 EOS is worth $2.49."
2019-01-25 00:00:00+00:00	Crypto firms are getting a new credit fund amid market downturn	['Lea Nonninger']	"This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence ""Fintech Briefing"" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here.

Crypto bank Galaxy Digital, which was founded by Michael Novogratz, is raising at least $250 million for a credit fund to offer US dollar loans to crypto firms, according to Business Insider, citing people familiar with the matter.

BI Intelligence

The fund, which will be run out of Galaxy’s asset management arm, will offer loans to crypto companies and in turn ask for crypto assets, properties, or crypto mining machines as collateral. The first round of fundraising will close in March.

Galaxy already lends to crypto businesses using its own balance sheet, but demand for funding is increasing. Galaxy has already invested in crypto companies, including blockchain startup Symbiont, which secured a $20 million Series B funding round earlier this week.

However, demand from crypto companies to borrow money has increased, likely because the crypto markets are down: Since the beginning of 2018, the price of Bitcoin has fallen over 80%, per CoinDesk. And this market downturn has affected many crypto firms negatively: For example, the funds that startups have raised via initial coin offerings (ICOs) have now decreased significantly in value. As such, these companies now need to raise more money to make up for the losses.

This funding will help struggling crypto firms continue to operate, but the success of the loans remains to be seen. Other firms are lending to crypto companies: Salt Lending has issued $52 million in loans to crypto firms through the end of 2018, and BlockFi has seen its revenue grow tenfold since June 2018, per Business Insider. Having projects specifically dedicated to helping the crypto space will help those companies push through the market downturn.

However, their ability to repay those loans will largely depend on the value of cryptos, as well as investors' demand for cryptocurrencies. With the crypto space being a largely unpredictable market, and the potential of cryptos losing more of their value, Galaxy may see a large number of defaults."

The police also said this form of currency was not backed as legal tender by the government and central financial institutions.

""The general public is informed not to make any type of investment in cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies (vcs) such as bitcoin because there is a real and heightened risk associated with them,"" an advisory issued by the Inspector General (IG) of crime branch said.

""This can result in a sudden and prolonged crash, exposing investors; especially retail consumers who stand to lose their hardearned money,"" it said.

The IG said the public needed to be alert to avoid getting trapped in such fraudulent schemes.

Through the medium of this warning notice and advisory, the general public is cautioned against the risks of investing in virtual currencies as these are not backed as legal tender by the government and central financial institutions, he said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not given any license and authorisation to any entity and company to operate in such schemes or deal with bitcoin or any virtual currency, and such cryptocurrencies do not have any regulatory permission or protection in India, the advisory stated.

As there is no regulatory oversight on cryptocurrencies which use blockchain technology, all transactions are encrypted and there is high risk as this platform is used for carrying out subversive activities, smuggling, drug trafficking, human trafficking, terror funding and money laundering, the IG added.

Bitcoin, which recorded its highest ever value on December 17, 2017, at $19,783.06, experienced a volatile market in 2018, burning the hands of some traders especially in Africa, according to checks by Business Insider Sub-Saharan Africa.

About three weeks ago, the digital coin traded to its lowest in a year at $3,222.67. With this volatility in the market, African traders and analysts believe the currency may see a further drop in this new year.

The digital currency opens trading on the first business day on Wednesday, January 2, 2018, above$ 3,800.

BusinessInsider

In 2019, analysts and traders expect the digital currency to fall further owing to various market activities. Most of them believed this is the best time for newcomers to enter the market due to the low price level.

Business Insider SSA spoke with some digital currency analysts and traders at the first Luno meetup event in Lagos in December 2018.

Bear market to continue in 2019

Olaleye Awe, crypto-investor and trader within the Bitcoin System, said the decline in the price of Bitcoin is a normal thing in any every market and a good time to buy. There is always a time to buy and sell. Time to expect a big drop or big high. It is just a normal market cycle.

“To be honest, we are going to be in the bear market in 2019, I doubt if there is going to be an all-time high in 2019.”

Generally, the bear market takes longer time and its a price market reaction. “You can buy small now and buy at a gradual market price considering the price level.”

Awe said the price spike of 2018 is inorganic and 2019 will see the currency growing organically. He advised newcomers to watch the market before moving in.

He said the EFT application earlier shifted to February and the Bate – physically backed bitcoin feature could kicks-tart a new bull run in the year.

Opportunities for new institutions to play in the digital market

Majesty Ibianga, a Cryptocurrency analyst, said this drop is a buying opportunity for newcomers and he sees a future spike in the price due to the EFT and other international development.

“The drop is healthy to correct the market and opportunity for new traders and institutions to come in at this time while retailer investors need to hand in and hold on the digital currency.”

Ibianga opined that 2019 and 2020 will be a better for the cryptocurrency market than 2018 as the digital currency will get more global attention.

Healthy corrections in the cryptocurrency market

For Lucky Uwakwe, Co-founder of Cheetah Africa and COO, Blockchain Solutions, the drop in the Bitcoin price over the year is a way to make room for healthy corrections in the market.

Uwakwe said the correction confirms Bitcoin and other digital currencies are actually real assets just as every other one.

In 2019, he said he expected to see cryptocurrency on much more positive trends.

Written by: Patricio Ortiz

Contxto – Cryptocurrencies have been intermittently stalling through muddy waters since they lost almost 80 percent of total market capitalization in the 2017-2018 period. But for Latin Americans, things have been on a “crypto-high” so far in 2019.

As Crypto News recently described, “crypto-mania appears to be hitting top gear” throughout the region. From Altcoins to Stablecoins, to ICOs, STOs or DApps—conceptual evolutions and territorial expansion continue to glide upwards in the Latin American crypto ecosystem.

Perhaps on the down-low, cryptos have been spreading across Latin America without caring too much about things like the tough “bear market.” Regardless of throwing lawyers and institutions for a few curveballs, cryptocurrencies keep finding ways to enhance our lives. I’d say they’re here to stay.

Nonetheless, there have been prevalent issues involving governments adamant about regulating cryptocurrencies. These efforts have turned abusive in some cases. For example, authorities in Venezuela targeted crypto remittances with high inflation rights, bureaucratic procedures, and payment rules.

Latin America crypto frenzy

In recognition of these challenges, I’d still say that cryptocurrencies still have market longevity. Here are quick overviews of some—but not all—of Latin America’s prominent crypto exchanges available on the market. Together, they provide people with easy access to crypto coins, crypto payments, crypto trading platforms, and speedy methods to acquire virtual currencies.

Country: Mexico

Among the top-rated cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America is Bitso. The venture has seen considerable growth in both the number of users along with trading volumes in recent years. All in all, Bitso has proven to be Mexican’s first choice when it comes to getting crypto.

Co-founder Pablo González mentioned to El Economista that, “although the use of virtual assets is still not so common in Mexico, it is estimated that the market size reaches about 800,000 users who have already adopted these types of assets.”

Bitso is currently Mexico’s largest crypto-platform where investors can easily deposit and trade their Mexican Fiat (pesos) from a diversed portfolio. Other altcoins like the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and the True USD (TUSD) are also available.

Country: Colombia

In collaboration with Blockchain Global, this Medellin-based crypto exchange offers a trading platform and payment gateway through Daex Pay. They guarantee users quick, easy, and secure access to users in Colombia and other Latin American countries.

Update (Jan. 21, 2020): Perhaps access was too easy to access, since recently DaexS was forced to close down temporarily due to excess traffic. Find out more here.

Country: Mexico

Beginning in 2014, Volavit claims to be Mexico’s pioneering crypto group, with basically the same KYC and verification terms as practically every other player from this list.

Volabit offers a simple dashboard with market prices listed in Mexican pesos. At the moment, it offers four cryptocurrencies: BTC, LTC, BCH, XRP. Soon it expects to launch a more professional trading platform called VEXBI with more trade facilitation features and e-coin variety.

Country: Colombia

This creative and colorful Colombian platform offers ample access to different coins and trading services with deposits as well as withdrawals available. Unlike other competitors, Panda Exchange stands out for using the innovative PoS (point of sale) Xeller machine permitting customers to pay with cryptocurrency.

It was first deployed at La Tortata sweet shop in Bogota, Colombia.

Country: Argentina

Previously known as Bitpagos until 2017, this Argentinian startup launched in mid-2014 with US$1.9 million’s worth of funding. According to company representative Juan Mendez, Ripio changed its name to distinguish itself from other contenders.

“The decision came as the startup’s mission shifted more toward consumer-facing services. BitPagos is a brand that was too linked to merchants and B2B (business to business) payment processing. Over the last year and a half, we’ve shifted most of our efforts towards users [and] consumers and we needed a brand that suits our mission best.”

Country: Peru

This Peruvian-based crypto exchange fulfills everything that a regular crypto-enthusiast could desire. Most likely, the enterprise feels super accomplished following astonishing trading volumes over the last weeks.

Further, Bitinka announced an integration of its platform with cryptocurrency projects DAI (Stablecoin) and Maker, which is currently ranked at number 17 on the Coin Market Cap list. This probably explains the recent trade surge of investments on the platform.

Country: Argentina

Best known for its Alto Viaje endorsement, this public transport company from Argentina made headlines for making cryptocurrencies a viable payment option. Like others, Bitex offers a simple platform allowing common people to access the most reputable crypto assets such as BTC and ETH.

“We believe that this type of projects are of great importance since they bring access to technology as disruptive as bitcoin to the common people, demonstrating the true value and the real application it has in everyday life”, said Bitex CMO Manuel Beaudroit to Latam Noticias.



Country: Chile

Gaining momentum in Chile is CryptoMarket offering a user-friendly experience for clients. Users can intuitively navigate its simple dashboard to place orders or quickly transfer funds from one asset to another. In terms of portfolio, the company offers XLM and EOS currencies. Both of these monetary units are expected to rule the scene in the near future due to their high currency values.

Country: Brazil

Cryptocurrencies are a hot topic in Brazil following Mercado Bitcoin’s judicial victory against a national bank. According to reports, Banco Sicoob deliberately closed user accounts and broke various laws in the process. Mercado Bitcoin offers a range of cryptos like BTC, LTC, BCH, and BTG, all of which can be quickly and safely accessed with Brazilian reales. Not long ago, another Brazilian crypto-startup called Bitcoin Max fought and also won a legal battle against Santander bank.

Country: Brazil

Some say that Bitcoin-to-You Claims became Brazil’s first crypto exchange when it appeared on the market in 2010. Currently, it boasts a portfolio of 10 cryptos including BTC, LTC and other prominent “alt-coins” like ZCash and BNB (Binance coin). Both the Chicago Stock Exchange and JPMorgan Chase use the company’s platform, according to Bitcoin-to-You’s website.

Country: Chile

This Chilean company previously known as SurBTC has operations in Colombia, Argentina, and Peru. Since its 2015 founding, Buda’s mobile application has gained a lot of attention for its attractive interface allowing users to easily obtain funds in the local currency. The interactive Android/IOS application makes smartphone transactions a piece of cake.

Country: Uruguay

Easy access, friendly presentation, and simplicity—this site has it all. Cryptofacil entered the market’s radar after they partnered with the USA Bittrex exchange. Now, the firm wants to position itself as a leader in the Latin American and Caribbean cryptocurrency markets.

“We developed Cryptofacil to focus on basic customer requirements: a simple and easy to use cryptocurrency platform, with superior customer support, and value-added services in a safe and secure environment,” said Andres Szafran Cryptofacil founder.

Country: Belize

Lo and behold, this Belize-based crypto exchange site has the best GESR (General Exchange Security Rating) than any other from our list. Livecoin ranks just below Bitinka in terms of transactional volume. To boot, the company has a giant portfolio showcasing different crypto assets, not to mention a reliable platform available in hundreds of markets.

It also shouldn’t be surprising that a country like Belize is the ideal place to pursue financial ventures. With cryptos, it isn’t any different. Belize has really embraced this emerging industry, which has helped the country earn global recognition back in 2016.

We will prevail

Among other global regions, Latin American entrepreneurs are steadily making moves in the cryptocurrency market while enhancing their moneymaking capabilities. The use of this new technology in this part of the world has just begun. With that said, we can only imagine that more and more people will eventually become users.

Despite the setbacks, they continue impressing analysts from Fundstrat Global Advisors. The American financial advisory board believes cryptos actually have longterm potential. As expected, more crypto exchanges seem to be popping up every day, some of them even becoming the fastest profit-making unicorn in history.

Against all odds and mainstream media criticisms, cryptocurrencies still represent a new disruptive asset class. Ultimately, they are a promising financial resource for society with untapped potential. Since we couldn’t mention every single Latin American cryptocurrency on the list, at least we can show you all of the exchanges from ICO Rating:

2019-02-28 09:05:57+00:00	Tron (TRX)’s Justin Sun Says The Bear Market Is Over And Binance’s Changpeng Zhao Foresees Increased Crypto Adoption	[]	"The crypto market may be finally free from the claws of the bearish trend that has been lurking around since back in 2018.

The last year has been called by many a year of correction for the market, a year which separated the valuable projects from the useless ones.

2019 is expected to be a better year regarding both prices and crypto adoption all over the world.

Things seem to be moving in the right direction so far, and Tron (TRX)’s Justin Sun believes that the bear market is finally over.

Justin Sun and Binance CEO CZ share new thoughts on the market

In an interview with the Chinese news portal Huoxing24, Sun and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) shared some pretty interesting thoughts on the crypto market.

Sun was asked about the future of Bitcoin and the whole industry, and he replied that BTC has already hit bottom.

He suggested that the year-long bear market has finally come to an end.

On the other hand, he doesn’t think that we’ll be experiencing any breakthrough in 2019 and he predicted that BTC’s price would remain somewhere between $3,000 and $5,000.

Sun also said that “The opportunities for market breakthroughs this year include the explosion of the dapp ecosystem, the large-scale application of the lightning network, and the three major opportunities for BitTorrent’s 100 million users to enter the cryptocurrency market.”

CZ foresees increased adoption for crypto

CZ, on the other hand, said that he is not able to predict the future of BTC or if we’ve hit bottom or not.

He believes that we’re definitely heading towards increased crypto adoption.

Samsung is the latest colossal name to support mainstream adoption. With its new flagship phone Samsung Galaxy S10 which will come with Bitcoin and crypto support, the company is encouraging the crypto mainstream adoption in more ways."
2019-01-03 19:18:25+00:00	Stocks Finally Crack the Cryptocurrency Market	['Jordan French']	"It's been a long time coming, but 2019 will finally see the cryptocurrency market make its mark on traditional finance in a tangible way.

While some will immediately point to Bitcoin futures contracts as evidence that it's already happened -- such as those offered by the CME and CBOE -- these are a simple half-measure designed to let some accredited investors and hedge funds get exposure to crypto volatility.

The real crypto market has been cut out of this equation. Cash settled futures, which represent how Bitcoin is traded on these enormous centralized exchanges, put no pressure on supply or demand for the cryptocurrency itself because at no point during the trade is any real Bitcoin changing hands.

The Jan. 7 launch of a new Nasdaq-powered crypto DX.Exchange is the biggest signifier yet that the status quo is shifting. It's not that institutional finance suddenly cares about including the cryptocurrency community, but that it has realized that cryptocurrency can aid its long-term goals for inclusive, cost-effective and cross-border asset exchange. DX.Exchange will soon offer tokenized stocks on the blockchain in a way that brings these two disparate markets together harmoniously for the first time.

Two Sides of the Same Coin

Cryptocurrency and stocks have been circling each other for years. Take the ICO fundraising model, for instance, which mimics how an IPO issues shares representing equity ownership in a public company. However, tokenholders aren't the same as shareholders and often don't enjoy the same voting rights or accountability, and regulators have already cracked down on the practice.

Additionally, during the cryptocurrency bull market of 2017, many publicly-traded stocks incorporated blockchain into their operations and even their company names, trying to capture some of the mania pushing crypto prices higher.

These are both unsustainable ideas, but not surprising considering that a two-way bridge between the crypto and equity markets is one of the last remaining hurdles for blockchain. Attempts by either market to adopt traits of or circumvent the other are equally untenable. Also, not only has cryptocurrency been shunned by the derivative crypto assets traded today, the financial industry itself now feels isolated from the great things happening in crypto.

Seeing these trends play out, some of the biggest names in traditional finance such as Bloomberg, NASDAQ and MPS Marketplace Securities have put their heads together to offer a solution.

It's coalesced in NASDAQ partner DX.Exchange, which already offers peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies, but in conjunction with these venerable institutions will now be able to issue blockchain tokens that mirror the live share prices of publicly-traded companies. Not only this, but the tokens are physically-backed 1:1 by the shares they represent, so when you send Bitcoin to your DX wallet and exchange it for Facebook Token or Apple Token, for example, you've just diversified your crypto portfolio with real shares in actual companies.

How Does It Work?

An innovative stack of utility supports this simple idea and is maintained by several of the world's biggest financial firms. When a person with Bitcoin or Ethereum wishes to buy tokenized shares of stock, they can simply log in to DX.Exchange and place a buy order for the chosen shares. Simultaneously, MPS MarketPlace Securities purchases and holds the physical shares (not cash-settled futures), while issuing the appropriate number of ERC20 tokens representing the physical shares.

Following this step, tokens are handed to the buyer through DX.Exchange to fill the trade. MPS also stores these shares and adjusts its holdings based on live DX demand. The exchange of crypto-to-stocks is handled by NASDAQ's FIX (Financial Information Exchange) system, a sophisticated messaging protocol used to send and confirm transactions between parties while preventing manipulation.

A Beneficial Blending of Markets

The fact that tokens are physically backed by stocks means that demand from the crypto market for these assets will impact share prices, just as a (potentially) upcoming ETF settled in BTC would provide demand for Bitcoin and impact its price. It also means more liquidity and volume for the stock market, and the chance to trade stocks on a 24/7 basis rather than being shut out at the close.

For cryptocurrency investors and traders, it also represents an opportunity to diversify their crypto-heavy portfolios without transferring in and out of fiat, as well as store their stocks on ERC20 wallets like the Trezor or Ledger Nano S. They can also invest in stocks cross-market, meaning the ability to buy shares of companies in Tokyo as well as those in the U.S. without going through multiple difficult (and for some, impossible) permissions processes.

By far the most important concept is compliance, however. Besides working alongside NASDAQ and partnering with the Bloomberg Crypto Center, DX is also regulated by the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which opens DX to EU customers who demand a regulated and fully-compliant trading experience.

We're slowly entering into an era where the internet of value is being liberated, and strangely enough, it's at the behest of those who once saw blockchain as a harbinger of evolution. As financial institutions and blockchain ideas increasingly find common ground, retail investors will find new opportunities to enjoy the emerging age of democratized finance.

2019-01-31 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin is about to do something it has never done before — hint: it’s not good	['Aaron Hankin']	"For those bitcoin enthusiasts hoping to put 2018 behind them, 2019 hasn’t got off to the best of starts with the most famous digital currency on track to log yet another losing month.

Barring a minor miracle, January will mark the sixth consecutive losing month for bitcoin — something it has never managed before, according to Dow Jones Market Data, which dates back to July 2010.

The streak began on Aug.1 with bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.50% trading above $7,700. Since then it has tumbled more than 50% with the darkest days coming in November when it crashed through support at $6,000, falling to as low as $2,500 a coin.

So with January coming to an end, will February end the unpopular record?

Probably not, if you ask Travis Kling, founder and chief investment officer of Ikigai Asset Management. He believes there’s more pain to come, arguing the industry needs a shake-up before the tide can truly turn. “More exchanges gone. More projects shuttering. More SEC enforcements. More ‘crypto is dead.’ Only then do we move higher,” he tweeted.

Market analyst Jani Ziedins also has reservations about the future of the nascent technology.

“There are cases like the dot-com bubble where the revolution was legitimate, the investors just got excited a little too early. Will bitcoin do the same in 10 years? I have my doubts,” he said in an email to MarketWatch.

“First, the magical thing about bitcoin was that by design it has a fixed supply. That was supposed to prevent manipulation and inflation. Bitcoins would get more valuable as time went by and their popularity increased. And that would have worked in a bubble. But bitcoin didn’t operate in a bubble and its popularity attracted countless copycats that greatly diluted the cryptocurrency market,” he said.

On the plus side, the cryptocurrency has logged gains in February each of the last four years.

On Thursday, a single bitcoin was fetching around $3,450, down more than 80% from its all-time high near $20,000.
