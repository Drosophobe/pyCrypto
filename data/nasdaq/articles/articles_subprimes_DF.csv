Thanks to the Boston Globe, I've been made aware of a great money-saving option for those parents of the bride still conscious after totaling up the costs of unloading giving over to matrimony your bundle of joy.

The price of modern wedding cakes can easily hit $500 or more, depending on the architecture and square footage. When you see the newlyweds grind $100 or so of this treasure into one another's faces, you may ask yourself if this is a wise use of your money. Obviously, many have answered no, the inspiration behind the fake wedding cake.

This cake, made of plastic foam and other durable materials and iced to look like the real thing, includes a discrete hatch in the bottom layer. Behind this hatch is secreted a piece of real cake which the bride or groom can grab for the ritual mutual feeding. Once this is accomplished, the faux cake is wheeled away to be 'cut' (you choose whether or not to let the guests in on the charade). At this point, slices of an inexpensive sheet cake can be substituted, while the fake cake is put away for the next ceremony.

I'm not a big fan of wedding ceremony, so this makes perfect sense to me. The question is, however, will the bride's mother accept the substitution? We all know she has the final word."
2007-11-30 22:06:22+00:00	The Limit Order Effect	['The University Of Chicago Graduate School Of Business']	"How do you buy and sell stocks? New research breaks down how limit orders can actually cause you to lose money in the market.

The following is based on research conducted by Juhani Linnainmaa, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.

According to previous research, individual investors are very sensitive to market news and short-term

returns; they tend to sell when

share prices rise and buy when share prices fall. In addition, they trade against

earnings surprises, selling shares of companies that release better than expected earnings news. In all these trades, investors lose money. The fact that investors systematically lose money contradicts

theories of market efficiency.

In the study ""The Limit Order Effect,"" University of Chicago Graduate School of Business professor Juhani Linnainmaa analyzed how the use of

limit orders alters previous assumptions about investor behavior.

When individuals want to buy shares of stock, they can use

market orders or limit orders. A market order offers the benefit of immediate purchase, though the investor is likely to pay a higher price. If the investor wants to use a limit order, he or she will set a cap on the highest price they are willing to pay for a share and indicate when the limit order will expire. In order for limit orders to execute, the market price must fall to the limit order price.

""If you aren't willing to pay the current market price for a stock, you submit a limit order and wait until someone is willing to sell,"" explains Linnainmaa. ""Since prices are constantly changing, a limit order may get executed in five minutes, an hour, a day, a month, or not at all.""

As Linnainmaa explains, there may be individual investors who can afford to wait for a better price and opt to use limit orders. If a company announces unexpected news, other investors who monitor the market closely may submit market orders to take advantage of the now-stale limit orders (a limit order becomes stale when there is news about the company).

The stale limit orders then execute. It will look as if limit order traders reacted to the news by trading in the wrong direction and losing money, with many individuals simultaneously making the same mistake. This can lead to false inferences about investors' stock-picking skills and timing.

A study that does not account for limit order investors' passive reaction to news runs the risk of confusing the cause and effect of investor behavior. Linnainmaa calls this bias ""the limit order effect."" ""The limit order effect suggests that many findings about investor behavior, including poor performance, can be explained as side effects of using limit orders,"" says Linnainmaa.

Linnainmaa combined individual investors' trading records with limit order data to examine the importance of the limit order effect. He finds that stale limit orders significantly alter inferences about investor behavior. The limit order effect may be a simple, yet powerful, explanation for many findings about individual investors' behavior and performance.

""If investors use limit orders, they lose money when their limit orders get executed in response to news in the market,"" says Linnainmaa. ""In any trade that takes place, informed investors will win. However, uninformed investors don't lose because they misinterpret information or because their behavioral biases generate systematically bad trades; they lose because they are uninformed.""

However, Linnainmaa notes, there is an upside to using limit orders.

""It should be kept in mind that individuals may still be doing the right thing by using limit orders,"" says Linnainmaa.

""If you use a market order, your immediate

loss might be greater than what you would expect to lose to the informed investors if you submitted a limit order instead.""

The use of limit orders can lead to false conclusions about the performance of individual investors. It is the limit order trader who appears to possess poor stock-picking skills and seems to misinterpret new information.

Widespread Use of Limit Orders

To study the limit order effect, Linnainmaa used data from the

Helsinki Exchanges

(HEX) from September 1998 to October 2001. Investor trading records were taken from all publicly traded Finnish stocks from the Finnish Central Securities Depository registry. Limit order data was obtained from the supervisory files of the exchange. Using these two data sets, it was possible to determine whether an investor used a market order or a limit order in 60 percent of all transactions.

Linnainmaa's findings are not specific to the Finnish market. Data from the U.S. also indicate the widespread use of limit orders. Using data from a U.S.

discount broker, Linnainmaa finds that nearly three-quarters of the orders submitted by the individual investors in the United States are limit orders. The magnitude of these numbers suggests that limit orders are likely to alter inferences about investor behavior in the United States.

Investor Behavior

Linnainmaa finds that limit orders significantly contribute to irregularities in investor behavior. Traders with stale, unmonitored limit orders appear to be poor stock pickers and seem to misinterpret new information. In contrast, market order traders earn positive returns when reacting to new information.

Earnings announcements provide a trading opportunity for investors who closely monitor the market. If an investor reacts to new information before competitors, he or she can profit from all the limit orders between the current and post-announcement

valuations. An earnings announcement renders all pre-announcement limit orders stale. If individuals have limit orders pending when the earnings announcement arrives, only the orders going ""against"" the news will execute.

Linnainmaa used data on earnings announcements released during regular trading hours to determine whether stale limit orders contributed to misinterpretation of new information. He computed average trading

gains for all executed orders around each announcement and found that the use of limit orders entirely explains the tendency to trade against firms' earnings announcements.

Stale limit orders triggered after announcements performed very poorly and lost money. Individual investors who submitted market orders immediately after announcements, however, earned superior returns. These results contradict the perception that individuals always misinterpret new information. Investors who make active decisions and submit market orders are interpreting new information accurately.""A stale limit order does not reflect current market information,"" notes Linnainmaa. ""Ideally, investors should withdraw limit orders as soon as there are changes in the market, but they rarely do. The problem is that individual investors don't have the resources to constantly monitor the market, which places them at a disadvantage relative to institutional investors.""

Previous research also has suggested that individual investors consistently tilt their

portfolios toward future losers and away from future winners, which suggests poor stock-picking skills. The stocks individual investors sell outperform the stocks they purchase. Linnainmaa finds that the subsequent performance of a trade depends on whether the individual used a market order or a limit order.

Individuals displayed poor stock-picking skills only when others traded against their limit orders. Market order traders did not exhibit systematically poor timing. Hence, individual investors do not lose money because they actively sell stocks that go up in

value and sell stocks that subsequently fall. It is their passive behavior that generates the losses. Someone with better information can tell which limit order traders are

offering to sell the stock at too low a price -- or

bidding too much for it -- and takes advantage of these uninformed investors who find themselves on the wrong side of the market when that information is publicly revealed.

How does limit order use affect inferences about individual investors' behavior? To address this question, Linnainmaa studied several behavioral patterns. For example, the tendency for investors to sell stocks with capital gains rather than capital losses from their portfolios is referred to as ""the disposition effect.""

Linnainmaa finds that limit orders significantly contribute to inferences about the disposition effect with almost half of the estimated disposition effect explained by limit orders.

Linnainmaa also studied how past stock returns affect investors' buying and selling decisions. Previous research has suggested that investors follow ""

contrarian trading strategies."" Limit orders are always contrarian, since they execute only when the stock price moves against the order: a limit order to sell executes when the price goes up while a limit order to buy executes when the price declines.

Linnainmaa finds that limit orders account for all of the short-term contrarian behavior and one-quarter of long-term contrarian behavior. The lesson is that individual investors are not necessarily ""swimming against the current"" because their behavioral biases tell them to do so: their decision to trade against past returns is a consequence of their limit order use.

Support for Market Efficiency

""Finding that investors lose money because they are uninformed, and not because they systematically make bad decisions, is actually good news for those who believe in market efficiency,"" says Linnainmaa. ""Underperformance is a result of individual investors' passive strategies -- they lose money when new information arrives because they often can't withdraw their limit orders in time. In the long run, limit order traders lose because investors with more precise information trade against them. Individual investors don't have negative stock-picking skills, they lose because they are uninformed.""

Linnainmaa also urges a degree of caution for investors: ""When choosing whether to use a limit order, an investor needs to consider whether they think the order will execute because an impatient investor is willing to pay that price or if the limit order price is set so far below the market price that it can only execute if there is news. If I set the price too low, I can only lose: either the stock goes up and my order doesn't execute, or the order executes because my limit order gets stale and someone takes advantage of it. Either way, I would just regret the order, so it would be better to set a higher price.""

2007-11-04 23:18:23+00:00	UPDATE 1-Citigroup CEO resigns, $8-11 bln writedown seen	['Jonathan Stempel', 'Dan Wilchins']	"(Adds CEO resignation, write-down)

NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Charles Prince has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Citigroup Inc C.N, which plans to take an additional $8 billion to $11 billion of write-downs for credit and other losses, the Wall Street Journal said on Sunday.

Robert Rubin, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary, will become Citigroup’s chairman, while Sir Win Bischoff, the chairman of Citigroup’s European operations, will become interim chief executive, the newspaper said.

Citigroup did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prince’s departure ends a tumultuous four-year tenure marked by heavy management turnover, questions over strategy, and mounting losses from bad loans and mortgages.

The added write-down would come just three weeks after Citigroup announced a $6.5 billion write-down for loan losses, subprime mortgages and other debt.

It would also come five days after Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N ousted its own chief executive, Stanley O'Neal, following an $8.4 billion write-down.

Citigroup has said it wants to boost capital, and CIBC World Markets analyst Meredith Whitney estimated that more than $30 billion may be needed. The problems are spurring more calls for the bank to be broken up because it is too unwieldy.

“I just don’t think (Prince) was the right person to run Citigroup,” said Jim Huguet, co-chief executive of Great Companies LLC in Tampa, Florida, a Citigroup shareholder. “He was brought in to fix their legal problems because he’s a lawyer, but they need someone who is capable of really building the business, and I don’t think that’s Prince’s forte.”

Rubin, 69, joined Citigroup in 1999 after more than four years as Treasury secretary, and chairs the bank’s executive committee. He has long been a close adviser to Prince, focused on strategy rather than day-to-day operations. Before joining the Clinton administration, Rubin had spent 26 years at Goldman Sachs & Co, becoming co-chairman of the investment bank.

Bischoff assumed his present position in May 2000 after the acquisition of Schroders Plc’s investment banking business by Citigroup unit Salomon Smith Barney. He had been chairman of Schroders since May 1995.

THE DANCING ENDS

Prince, 57, has struggled to improve results at Citigroup, especially in U.S. consumer banking, its biggest business.

He has also been under enormous pressure to cut expenses, including from the New York-based bank’s largest individual investor, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.

While he appeared to have some success early this year, the write-down all but thwarted that goal for 2007.

Prince didn’t help his cause in July when he said Citigroup was “still dancing” to a private equity buyout boom that was about to flame out, suggesting to investors that he didn’t appreciate the risks in leveraged lending.

Citigroup also has exposure to mortgages through tens of billions of dollars of off-balance-sheet structured investment vehicles, and is in talks with rivals to set up a conduit to buy assets from troubled SIVs.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether Citigroup accounted properly for its own SIVs, the Wall Street Journal said.

Investors have pushed Citigroup shares down 32 percent this year. The stock is also down 17 percent since Prince in October 2003 took over as the hand-picked successor of Sanford “Sandy” Weill, his mentor since joining a Baltimore firm called Commercial Credit Co in 1986.

It’s not clear who might become Citigroup’s permanent chief executive. Upper management has undergone rapid turnover, leaving the bank without an obvious immediate successor.

Analysts have said John Thain, who runs NYSE Euronext NYX.NNYX.PA, might be a candidate. Internal candidates may include Vikram Pandit, who oversees investment banking and alternative investments, and Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden. Analysts have said neither may be ready yet.

Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N and Swiss bank UBS AG UBSN.VX also shook up top management in 2007 after credit losses.

REVOLVING LEADERSHIP DOOR

The first half of Prince’s tenure was marked by a cleanup of ethical and regulatory problems. Citigroup paid more than $5 billion to settle litigation, including over its work for Enron Corp and WorldCom Inc and the issuance of inflated stock research by analysts like the now-discredited Jack Grubman.

Prince bowed deeply at a October 2004 Tokyo news conference in apology for a scandal that caused the closure of Citigroup’s private bank in Japan. The U.S. Federal Reserve barred the bank from acquisitions for a year while it cleaned up its house.

When Prince refocused on Citigroup’s operations, he emphasized organic growth, especially outside the United States, saying Citigroup was too big to pursue the “transformational” acquisitions that marked Weill’s tenure.

He sold asset management and insurance units, and added branches and lending offices for the stagnating U.S. consumer banking unit. Acquisitions, apart from a pending purchase of Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp 8603.T, were small.

But revenue didn’t grow fast enough, while expenses grew too much. Prince in April set 17,000 job cuts companywide."
2007-12-10 00:00:00+00:00	Bull Monday for financials	[]	"Bull Monday for financials

Today’s tickers: XLF, NFI, CFC, CELG, NKE

XLF– Financial Select Sector SPDR – A near-2% gain in the underlying share of the financial sector ETF spurred bullish option traders to pull out the proverbial stops. With more than 360,000 contracts trading before noon, the XLF is the day’s most liquid option family by a long shot, and call buyers are putting pedal to metal with 3 times more calls in play than puts. Of interest here is massive buying interest in January 35 calls, which attracted a volume of more than 124,000 lots, with premiums up some 43% on the session. Calls at the 34 strike traded nearly 68,000 times, mostly to the middle of the market.

NFI - Options in Kansas City-based subprime mortgager Novastar Financial Group (NFI). Late last week the company disclosed that Wachovia had waived certain financial requirements from the group that might help Novastar forestall bankruptcy proceedings. Today its options are trading at more than 6 times the average rate, owing to what may be the closing of positions in December 5.0 puts against the buying of December 5.0 calls. While the current share price represents just a 2% sliver of its 52-week high of $117.28, the rush to call buying activity even at the very meager strike of 5.0 suggests some degree of confidence in the market that Novastar might just scrape by with a little help from its friends.

CFC –With nearly 60,000 contracts in play against a 5.8% advance for shares to $12.21, options in mortgager Countrywide rated among the most liquid option families in early market action according to our scanners. The reversal in share price activity is part of a larger bull wave in the financials today, as financial companies still grappling with exposure to mortgages and mortgage-backed derivatives announce new tactical measures to remain afloat in the housing recession and ensuing credit squeeze. Our data shows calls and puts moving at a comparable clip, with the gain in share prices adding girth to call-side premiums. The December 12.50 calls traded more than 19,000 times on premiums up some 40% to $0.65. Heavy put-side volume was observed in January 10.0 puts, which traded more than 11,000 times.

CELG – Celgene – Disappointing clinical results for pipeline cancer drugs continue to be a prime mover of volume and volatility in the option market today. Today’s big mover is Celgene, the developer of cancer and autoimmune disease drugs, whose shares were down 14.5% to $49.00 at the noon hour. Over the weekend, the company reported the results of clinical trials for its leukemia drug Revlimid at the annual convention of the American Society of Hematology. The data revealed a so-called “complete response rate” to Revlimid that was lower than many had anticipated, and compared unfavorably to a competing drug by Millennium Pharmaceutical. Options in Celgene today are moving at 7.4 times the average volume against a 14.5% decline in share price to $49.00. Of note here is fresh writing in the December 50 puts on a sum volume of more than 12,000 lots, which would suggest a high-risk, highly speculative bet on Celgene shares making a quick recovery. Fresh volume in the December calls at the same strike attracted buyers and sellers. Also notable is the 16.3% gain in implied volatility to 53.4% - 1.5 times the historic reading.

NKE – Iconic shoe and athletic wear Nike is due to announce Q2 2008 numbers next Wednesday after the bell. The past several weeks have put Nike at the center of a barrage of deal-making activity in the sports apparel sphere, first with its bid for jersey-maker Umbro, followed by later speculation that the company might make a play for Adidas. For now we’re surmising that it’s pre-earnings interest – and not the sentencing of its former endorser Michael Vick - that’s driving option action in Nike to more than four times the average volume, against a .61% gain for shares to $65.80. The prevailing theme appears to be one of a shift toward defensiveness, with positions in the January 70 calls selling off on a volume of 5,000 lots as similar volumes were involved in bear put spread activity in the January contract between strikes of 60 and 65. This brings the proportion of puts trading to twice that of calls – prior to today’s session, the proportion of open put to call positions was roughly equal. Implied volatility at 31.5% shows a very slight gap above the 30.7% historic reading.

2007-11-09 21:59:52+00:00	Screenshot Purports to Show Hackers with Root Access on MediaDefender Server in April	['Condé Nast', 'Kim Zetter', 'John Semley', 'Grace Browne', 'Maggie Chen', 'Scott Gilbertson', 'Lily Hay Newman', 'Matt Burgess', 'Jon Brodkin', 'Ars Technica']	"

Nearly two months ago a group of hackers released to BitTorrent a trove of e-mails, source code and other materials that they grabbed from a compromised server or servers belonging to anti-piracy company MediaDefender. Today I obtained a screenshot of a log purporting to show the hackers with root access on the MediaDefender server on April 10th of this year.

I can't verify the authenticity of the log, which could have been fabricated, but the log shows the hackers with root on a server referred to as ""PM"" at the following IP address: 65.120.42.146.

An internal MediaDefender e-mail that was among those seized by the hackers and released to BitTorrent in September shows MediaDefender employees discussing the hacked ""PM"" server and its IP address -- the IP address that appears in the log screenshot. That e-mail (shown below) is dated two months after the log showing MediaDefender's server compromised.

From: Norman Heath [mailto:XXXX@mac.com] Sent: Wednesday, June 06, 2007 7:02 PM To: it Cc: Gerald Rode; Jay Mairs; Ivan Kwok; Gilberto Vargas Subject: pm webserver The 65.120.42.146 pm webserver has been compromised. What I need Gerald to do is backup everything on this server. You have to SSH to it from another box in the office, as you can't get to it from the outside world. So back it up to the munger server or dcmaster or wherever. Use the 'scp' command to do this or another method. IT is creating another web server with CentOS 5 on it. When they are done they will give it an IP and email Gerald this IP. We need this new server to be the fully functional pm server by 9 am in the morning. At this time we will give the new server the 65.120.42.146 IP and all will be back to normal. We are going to swap servers basically. As a side note, please do not ever use the old passwords on anything. Every other hacker in the world has those passwords, because we used them for years on our windows servers. Ty

MediaDefender didn't respond to a call for comment today. The company also didn't respond to repeated calls in September seeking authentication of the e-mails. But after the e-mails were leaked to BitTorrent, MediaDefender sent a series of takedown notices to sites hosting the e-mails claiming them as trade secrets.

It's unclear when the hackers first breached MediaDefender's security, but a note the hackers posted with some of the purloined material indicates that they'd breached MediaDefender's security as early as January of this year.

2007-11-15 16:39:07+00:00	Should Aurelio and Arbeloa be first-choice Liverpool fullbacks?	[]	"We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission – at no extra cost to you. By using this website you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Fabio Aurelio, Alvaro Arbeloa, Steve Finnan and John Arne Riise. Four contrasting full backs who offer something a little bit different to the Liverpool team.

Having watched the Liverpool v Besiktas massacre, it was noted by the commentator that some of Liverpool’s most impressive wins have come when Aurelio and Arbeloa have played together; this was evidenced in the games against Arsenal last season, Reading and Besiktas this season.

I have felt for quite some time that both these players should be our first choice full backs on a permanent basis. I have never been a John Arne Riise fan and how he has lasted this long at LFC is beyond comprehension. A very limited player and to quote Paul Tomkins when he rightly says that Riise is….. “jack of all trades, master of none“. The upshot…. solid, dependable, the odd spectacular goal and thats about it. The downshot….no pace and ‘probably the most one left-footed player in the history of the game‘, to coin our sponsor’s phrase.

Our attacking play suffers when he plays at left-back because he doesn’t offer much by way of overlap and thus penetration. For example, witness Patrice Evra’s involvement in Man U’s second goal against Arsenal last weekend. When can you honestly say Riise has done something similar, let alone regularly, for Liverpool?

Whether this is down to tactics or not is a matter open for debate, but it seems almost certain that having watched him play for so long he does not take enough responsibility when going forward. Fabio had been extremely unlucky with injuries throughout his career and so far that trend has only just abated, but for how long who knows?

What is most impressive about Aurelio is not only his passing, (according to Rafa, Fabio is a better passer than Alonso) but his ability on the ball and his willingness to overlap (outside or inside) the winger in front of him, be it Kewell, Babel or Riise. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Riise. Furthermore, Aurelio nearly always makes himself available to receive the ball by making triangles. He also does not have Riise’s extremely annoying propensity to “hoof” the ball even when there is clearly time and space to do something a little more constructive, be it to carry the ball forward, play a one two with his winger as he advances up the field or simply pass the ball infield. If Fabio can stay fit and get a run of games than his critiques will see that he is without a shadow of a doubt our most accomplished left-back.

Concerning the right-back position, Steve Finnan has been fantastic for Liverpool over the last few years. However he is now 31 and his best years I feel are behind him. His form has been patchy this season and because Arbeloa has been a revelation since he joined us in January it may be time for ol’ Stevie Finnan to make way. Alvaro is by no means the finished article, but at 24 he can only improve and thus his peak years are crucially still ‘in front’ of him, whereas as aforementioned, Finnan’s are behind him.

In comparison to Krompkamp and Josemi, Arebloa is Javier Zanetti. Mobile, very comfortable on the ball, intelligent passer and hungry for success, Arbeloa has the necessary ingredients to be our mainstay right-back for years to come, all things being equal of course. Where he needs improvement is in his defending. Prone to the odd mistakes he does not have Finnan’s near 100% reliability, but it should come with time.

A versatile player he may be, but Alvaro is not a defensive midfielder in any shape or form. His failure to track Fabregas’s run in what turned out to be Arsenal’s equalising goal should not blotch his growing reputation amongst knowledgeable Liverpool fans. Asking him to play that position against the caliber of Arsenal was a mistake on Benitez’ part, and his part alone, even if it was for the last 15 minutes or so of the game.

In the same way Aurelio operates at left-back, Arbeloa usually makes himself available to receive the ball without being under pressure. The one twos and the triangles are also part and parcel of his game. Hugging the touchline in much the way Aurelio does, Arbeloa helps to stretch the opposition by giving the team extra width. Given his footballing education at R.Madrid Castilla its not surprising.

It will be interesting to see whether or not Benitez will employ Aurelio and Arbeloa as his two orthodox full backs despite the rotation. Only time will tell, but what are your thoughts and if you were the Liverpool manager, who would you play at left and right back?"
