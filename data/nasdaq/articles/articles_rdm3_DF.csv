Crypto markets have dropped a great deal in value over the last 24 hours as crypto assets across the board have lost anywhere between 7-15% in value during this time period. The overall market valuation of all 10,000+ crypto-assets in existence has slid just below the $2 trillion handle, losing over 9% in value during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Economy Slips by 9% During the Last 24 Hours

Bitcoin (BTC) prices were above the $48K zone on Sunday, September 19, but the following day, BTC prices are much lower as the crypto asset dropped to a low of $42,660 per unit on Monday. BTC has shed 8.9% in value and the digital asset’s market valuation is around $815 billion today. At the time of writing, a single BTC is swapping for just above $43K per coin.

The second-leading crypto asset, ethereum (ETH) has dropped 10.3% in value during the last day and each ether is exchanging hands for just above $3K per unit. ETH has an overall market valuation of around $355.4 billion on Monday.

The biggest loser out of the top ten crypto-asset market positions is XRP, shedding 13.8% during the course of the last day. Bitcoin’s (BTC) 8% loss is the least of all the percentage losses on Monday. Just before BTC’s slide below $45K, Etoro’s crypto analyst discussed the current market events.

“Bitcoin and ether both experienced a weekend slip after a week of climbing back to previous highs,” Simon Peters, Etoro’s crypto analyst wrote in a note to Bitcoin.com News on Monday morning. “BTC began the week below $45,000 after the flash crash of the week before. Having risen across the week to near $49,000 levels the price collapsed again on Sunday, falling away to now trade around $45,500.” Peters added:

Likewise, ETH began the week trading around $3,200 before rising to a high of $3,652 on Thursday. The token began a decline earlier than bitcoin though, falling away from Thursday and across the weekend to now trade below $3,200, a 13% decline.

Cosmos Remains Unscathed, Fears of Economic Turmoil Stemming from Evergrande Collapse and Default Risks Rise

Overall, the entire crypto market cap has lost over 9% in fiat value between Sunday and Monday. The top coins being traded include nine different stablecoins. Besides the stablecoin action today, the coin that took the least amount of fiat loss is cosmos (ATOM). Cosmos only lost 0.9% on Monday and is up over 9% for the last seven days. The biggest loser today is Algorand (ALGO) losing 16.6% during the last 24 hours.

Cryptocurrency markets have followed the drop across all global markets on Monday as a few warnings of economic turmoil have arisen. For instance, news outlets detail that the U.S. may default on financial obligations which could turn into another financial crisis.

The secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Janet Yellen, has warned of a debt ceiling fallout. Furthermore, global stock markets are in the red over China Evergrande shares dropping like a rock. Evergrande shares saw an 11-year low and speculators have claimed the Evergrande collapse could be like the next Lehman Brothers crisis.

On Sept. 13, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed legislation that would close a tax loophole for cryptocurrency investors by imposing ""wash sale"" rules on commodities, currencies and digital assets, according to a released outline. Currently, investors can sell cryptocurrency for a loss and claim a tax benefit. Then, investors can immediately buy back the asset if it rebounds. So-called ""wash sale"" rules would prevent investors from buying the same asset back right away. Subjecting cryptocurrency and other assets to this proposed change would raise $16.8 billion over a decade, according to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

2. Senators demand cryptocurrency regulation guidance from SEC

On Tuesday, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the Senate Banking Committee that the SEC is working overtime to create a set of rules for cryptocurrency markets to protect investors. ""Currently, we just don't have enough investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading, or lending,"" Gensler said in prepared remarks. ""Frankly, at this time, it's more like the Wild West or the old world of 'buyer beware' that existed before the securities laws were enacted."" Some lawmakers also pressed Gensler about whether certain crypto assets, like stablecoins, meet the definition of a security, which has been an ongoing subject of concern and confusion for regulators and the crypto community.

3. Ray Dalio says if bitcoin is really successful, regulators will ‘kill it’

On Wednesday, Ray Dalio told CNBC that he believes that regulators would ultimately take control of bitcoin if the cryptocurrency is successful. ""I think at the end of the day if it's really successful, they will kill it and they will try to kill it. And I think they will kill it because they have ways of killing it,"" Dalio told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the SALT conference. ""You have El Salvador taking it on and you have India and China getting rid of it. And you have the United States talking about how to regulate it and it could still be controlled,"" he said. Still, Dalio disclosed that he has ""a certain amount of money in bitcoin,"" but noted that the allocation is smaller than his gold exposure. ""It's an amazing accomplishment to have brought it from where that programming occurred to where it is through the test of time,"" he said.

2021-09-20 10:57:01+00:00	Cryptocurrency Update: Top 5 Cryptos that Surge up to 690% in 24 Hours. Know Details	[]	"More cryptocurrencies have been on the rise lately. The global crypto market cap at the time of this article stood at $1.99 trillion which points to a 7.60 per cent decline over the course of the last day, according to information on CoinMarketCap. However, contrary to this, the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours has aggregated to a total of $101.78 billion at the time of writing this article. This indicated a 20.13 per cent increase for the same. With that said, there are a few cryptocurrencies, other than the usual Bitcoin, who are which are worth mentioning as they have seen significant gains over the last 24 hours as per information on CoinMarketCap.

Keeping this in mind, here are the top five gainers that the cryptocurrency market has witnessed over the course of the last day.

Top 5 Cryptocurrency Gainers (According to data from CoinMarketCap)

1) Aqua Pig – $ 0.000000000014 – 689.25 per cent change over the last 24 hours

2) Gravitoken – $0.02383 – 263.75 per cent change over the last 24 hours

3) CONTRACOIN – $0.2553 – 237.84 per cent change over the last 24 hour

4) SafeBull – $0.00000001228 – 225.76 per cent change over the last 24 hours

5) InfinityCake – $0.0000007175 – 192.92 per cent change over the last 24 hours

On the other end of the cryptocurrency spectrum, we have the top ghost coins dominating the market. These include the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and so on. It should be noted that a majority of the top coins, including Bitcoin, have displayed a tendency to trade red, especially at the time of this article. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin, all top coins in the market, have been trading red over the past 24 hours. In most of the cases, they have also been trading red over the course of the past 7 days as per information on CoinMarketCap.

As per the data that was analysed, Bitcoin was trading at $45,093.11 which was 6.50 per cent down over the last 24 hours and 1.45 per cent up over the course of the week. The second most popular cryptocurrency, Ether was trading at $3,164.36 or an 8.09 per cent decline over the course of the last day. The coin was trading 1.58 per cent lower over the course of the last seven days. Cardano, Tether and Binance Coin took third, fourth and fifth place respectively.

Speaking on the performance of the top cryptocurrency, ZebPay Trade Desk said, “Bitcoin (BTC) has been fairly range-bound over the last couple of days, trading between $45,000 – $48,000. This seems to be a consolidating phase that the asset is operating in, and the bears are preventing the asset from crossing the $48,000 mark convincingly, making this a strong psychological resistance level for BTC.”

Apart from these, Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, the so-called ‘meme coins’, have garnered a lot of interest and attention over the past couple of months thanks to Tesla CEO and billionaire, Elon Musk. This all started when Musk took to Twitter to announce the arrival of his new Shiba Inu puppy that he named Floki. Soon after that both the Dogecoin and the SHIBA coin saw a dramatic jump in prices as the infamous ‘Musk’ effect took hold of the cryptocurrency market once again. This saw Dogecoin reach all the way to 9th place amongst the top crypto coins in the market. As of today it once again slipped down one space though and stood at a price of $0.2159 and was trading at 9.69 per cent down over the course of the past 24 hours.

NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency prices sank on Monday as concerns over the spillover risk to the global economy from Chinese property group Evergrande's (3333.HK) troubles spread across financial markets.

Bitcoin , the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, tumbled to $42,453.97, its lowest level since Aug. 7 before trimming some losses to trade down 7.4% at $43,745. It hit a near four-month high above $52,000 on Sept. 6.

Smaller rival ether , the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, fell more than 10% below $3,000 for the first time since early August. It was last down 7.6% at $3,071.

Market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market dropped 10% on Monday to under $1.94 trillion, from last Saturday's $2.17 trillion.

The loss in the value of cryptocurrencies comes at a time when institutional interest in the space has surged and some investment banks have ramped up their forecasts for cryptocurrencies in the coming months.

""It's red, red, red across the board today as the cryptocurrency markets follow the downturn being seen in traditional markets as China battles a highly-contagious property market crisis,"" said Tim Frost, chief executive officer at Yield App, a financial technology company that enables users to invest in decentralized finance.

""Bitcoin has lost support at the $44,000 mark and looks set to test its $39,000 floor. If it falls through here we can expect a significant correction to come,"" he added.

Bitcoin shorts in the futures markets have increased to 1,187 contracts , the largest since early August, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released Friday.

2021-09-29 19:25:30+00:00	Regulating the unregulated cryptocurrency market	['Christina Pazzanese', 'Harvard Staff Writer']	"Is cryptocurrency the future of global banking and trade, or a sketchy payment and investment vehicle favored by scammers and speculators, criminal organizations, and any individual or entity shut out of Western banking systems, like North Korea?

The jury is still out. One thing that is clear, however, is that the cryptocurrency market continues to grow as its popularity has become more mainstream since 2019. Even many once-skeptical institutional investors have come around after seeing some of the mind-boggling returns. In January 2019, one Bitcoin traded for $3,441; this week, it hit $43,136.

But that success may have a price. Calls to rein in the industry are at fever pitch. This month China, one of the world’s largest digital currency markets, outlawed all crypto-related transactions. It banned trading them in 2019. The U.S. Treasury said this week it will sanction a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time for facilitating ransomware payments. New tax and trading rules for the industry are included in legislation Congress is scheduled to vote on by week’s end. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also pushing for greater enforcement. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler called cryptocurrency an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse” and said investors don’t have enough regulatory protection from the swarms jumping into crypto finance, issuance, trading, and lending.

Q&A

Scott Duke Kominers

GAZETTE: There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, but no consensus on the precise number. The range is between 5,000 and 12,000, valued at about $2 trillion. What does the landscape look like today?

KOMINERS: Those numbers sound huge, but there are actually many, many more than that because lots of crypto products are not currencies and lots of cryptocurrencies are too small to be part of mainstream exchanges. Many crypto products are effectively just tokens. Sometimes these are representative of ownership in decentralized autonomous organizations, which are organizations that share governance rights and returns to a committee of participants by allocating them tokens — a bit like stock shares. There are project-specific tokens used in specific online games or among individual communities. There are NFTs, which are unique non-fungible tokens that have been used as representing ownership over things like digital artworks. Tons of these are being minted daily at this point. So, there is a very large landscape. The pure currency aspect of it is a huge market on its own, but a drop in the bucket of the total applications of crypto and blockchain technology today.

GAZETTE: What’s the appeal for investors? Is it just the eye-popping returns or is there more to it?

KOMINERS: Some people have gotten interested in cryptocurrency because of the investment returns, unquestionably. But there are also real, practical infrastructure and technology benefits. You’re starting to see countries willing to receive officially recognized crypto payments. And people have been considering whether crypto technology can be used to deliver government aid. This is because when it’s working, crypto is frictionless, and thus creates a much more efficient way of transferring and sharing value among people. And, as a result, there’s a real opportunity to use crypto for large-scale payments, as well as in things like small business payment processing. Also, there’s a big opportunity for enhancing financial inclusion, by providing secure payment networks and cross-border transfers in places that don’t otherwise have well-structured consumer financial systems. So, while some people are interested in this for the short- or medium-term investment opportunity, I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.

GAZETTE: The SEC chairman called this an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.” Is this industry operating in a rule-free, “Wild West” atmosphere, as he suggested?

KOMINERS: I haven’t read the full Gensler remarks, so I can’t comment explicitly on his overall take, but I can comment on some of the individual elements you mention. It’s clear that this space needs much more consumer protection, and we’re starting to see that. Right now, if a hacker gains access to your crypto wallet, they can drain it and you may have no recourse. But the newer waves of wallet technologies and crypto exchanges are thinking hard about all the things consumers expect out of banking products and equities trading accounts. They’re trying to create more security and protections at the consumer-interface level. And then, of course, you also need regulation to prevent financial crime and scams, just like we have in other parts of the financial-services industry.

GAZETTE: Some lawmakers have pointed to the GameStop stock trading frenzy in early 2021 as analogous to the crypto market, saying that most ordinary investors have gotten caught up in hype and don’t fully understand the risks they’re taking.

“I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.”

KOMINERS: First of all, it’s important to note that the GameStop run-up wasn’t in a new trading arena — it was Internet-hyped trading of a specific stock in the regular stock market. That said, the GameStop story is in some sense analogous to the meme trading of crypto products like Dogecoin — there’s consumer confusion around the idea that these assets could lose value. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the GameStop and Dogecoin run-ups and crashes. They were on a platform that made trading feel like a video game, and didn’t understand the real risks. And so in those ways, it’s analogous. Consumers and investors need to understand that these are high variance, speculative assets.

But when you get to the technology infrastructure pieces, GameStop and crypto can look very different. Cryptocurrency trading now looks a lot like equities trading — you have a brokerage account at an exchange, or potentially on a platform like Robinhood. But for many of the other crypto applications, the infrastructure is very, very new, and the platforms are very, very new, and they’re not heavily protected.

I think we’ll see more regulation around messaging and communication, but there are also more structural questions. For example, one of the regulatory conversations is around stablecoins — crypto assets that hold nominally fixed values because they’re designed to just be used for moving money from one place to another in a fixed denomination. They’re typically backed by reserves in a way similar to how banks back their loans with deposits. But there are questions about how to properly structure those reserves. If everyone simultaneously decided they wanted to divest, will stablecoins have the reserves to support that? I expect to see regulation around allowable assets and reserve design — just like we have with banks.

And finally, we’ll need regulation to ensure open competition among different crypto products and platforms.

GAZETTE: Besides fending off regulations, what are the industry’s other challenges?

KOMINERS: One basic challenge is around taxation of crypto income. This isn’t just about tax avoidance concerns — a lot of people would like to pay taxes on their crypto but have absolutely no idea how to do so. We don’t have clear crypto categories for taxation purposes, so it’s extremely complicated to figure out which parts are ordinary income versus capital gains, as well as when the associated income has accrued. Organizing the tax treatment of all these assets — and then, of course, ensuring tax payment — is essential.

Another challenge is environmental: A lot of the most popular crypto technologies at the moment require tremendous amounts of energy to run. And so, we’re going to start seeing government leadership and regulation driving a shift toward versions of this technology that are more environmentally sustainable.

Bitcoin and other early blockchains use a technology where you have to prove that you solved a very hard computational problem to record transactions securely. And solving those computational problems is taking up absurd amounts of energy. Newer blockchains use much less energy-intensive ways of validating transactions. And so, my guess and hope is that the way we’re going to get away from environmentally harmful cryptocurrency transactions is through continual improvements in the technology, alongside regulation and market forces pushing toward technologies that are much more efficient.

GAZETTE: If new regulations are on the way, what would be the best- or worst-case scenarios for the industry?

KOMINERS: I don’t think it’s a question of ‘no regulation’ versus ‘a lot.’ The real question is the extent to which regulators understand that crypto is a different type of product and tech infrastructure from anything they’ve regulated before. The worst case would be to just treat it like historical financial products or like historical tech platforms without thinking about the ways in which crypto differs, both in terms of its use cases and in terms of its underlying technology."
2021-09-18 23:00:13+00:00	Cryptocurrency: what is cryptocurrency, how it works, and why is crypto market down?	['The Staff Byline', 'Mostly Used For Collaborative Articles', 'Other Posts Covering Technology News', 'Features', 'Leaks', 'Informative Lists', 'Comparisons', 'How-Tos Etc.']	"Everyone wants a piece of the cryptocurrency market right now but what is it and how does it work?

Cryptocurrency is all the rage among people these days, especially the younger demographic. Everyone wants a piece of it, or at least dabble in the space to spur their curiosity. But, what is cryptocurrency? How does it work and how do you get to own it? These are some of the basics questions that we try to answer over here so that more people know more about it, and make a sound decision based on facts rather than any marketing gimmick. Here is everything from A to Z you need to know about cryptocurrency.

What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of virtual currency that operates in a decentralised ecosystem — this means it is not part of any country’s legalised set-up and that no government has control over cryptocurrencies as these are issued by private companies. Being a virtual currency, crypto can be sent or received from any part of the world as geography is no longer a limitation for money to move across borders.

Currently, there is a wide range of crypto available in the market in which a person can invest. The most popular ones are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin Ripple, and NEO, among others. You can transfer cryptos between two accounts without needing a bank’s authorisation. This model has become appealing to many people these days, who are willing to give cryptos a shot, no matter what the results are.

How cryptocurrency works

As we mentioned, cryptocurrency operates in a decentralised system, which is called a blockchain. Basically, this technology runs through multiple computers that take care of the entire transaction in a ledger format. It is impossible to alter or delete these transactions, which makes it appealing for its secured nature. It also works through two-factor authentication, which is always the preferred choice of transacting virtually, no matter what system you are using.

So, let’s say you want to invest in Bitcoin or Ripple, you need to follow the basics of any financial transaction.

The person must open a crypto trading account

For that, all you have to do is apply for an account, submit Know Your Customer (KYC) documents that verify your identity and credentials

Once your application is approved, you can start trading in all kinds of cryptocurrencies

There are various crypto exchanges platforms like Coinbase, Binance, WazirX, Zebpay, and CoinDCX, among others that you have in India. Like the stock market, cryptos rely on market speculation, rumours, or a piece of booming news to push up the value of certain crypto, or bring it down. Most financial experts talk about its volatile nature, especially because of its infant stature in the ecosystem. So people are warned about its possible drawbacks before deciding to invest in Bitcoin, Ripple, or any other crypto.

Why is the crypto market down?

As we mentioned, the crypto market operates heavily on the basis of speculations. So any possible pro-crypto news can spike its value and even the slightest shadow of doubt over its performance can bring it down. Recently, crypto enthusiasts saw the dark side of investing in digital currencies. The crypto market has seen a decline due to the following reasons in the past:"
2021-09-08 02:31:04+00:00	Why Bitcoin, ether, other crypto prices are crashing	[]	"Bitcoin prices plummeted from more than $52,000 per coin, over 17% to $42,000, before recovering about half of that loss after El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday. However, the rollout stumbled in its first hours and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

Tuesday’s selloff is the most significant break in the rebound that had lifted Bitcoin almost 75% since late July. Overall cryptocurrency market value fell about $300 billion in the past 24 hours, according to tracker CoinGecko.

The world's largest cryptocurrency staged a small recovery as Bitcoin prices today were at around $46,757, down 11%. Meanwhile, other digital coins followed the lead with ether fell over 11% to $3,471 whereas dogecoin and cardano prices plunged 15% and 12% to $0.26 and $2.5 respectively. Stellar, XRP, Uniswap also crashed in the range of 15-20% over the last 24 hours.

“Social media platforms were very cautious over the weekend that a plunge could occur following El Salvador’s big day,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., wrote in a note, as reported by Bloomberg. Some investors likely bought in anticipation of the nation implementing its Bitcoin law Sept. 7 and then moved to “sell the fact,"" he said.

According to experts, bitcoin was still in the bull market as long the price stayed above the $43,000 level.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings and a long-time cryptocurrency bull, told Bloomberg the market for digital coins was running strong over the last eight weeks and became overbought. Interest from individual investors spiked on the back of large institutions jumping on board the crypto wagon, he said.

David Gerard, author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,"" told the Associated Press that Tuesday’s Bitcoin volatility likely had little to nothing to do with El Salvador. “My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

“Bitcoin basically doesn’t respond to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard said. “That sort of price pattern, where it crashes hugely in minutes then goes back up again, is usually one of the big guys burning the margin traders."" Because Bitcoin is so thinly traded, it could also have been a big holder making a large sale to have cash, thus sending the market for a ride, Gerard said.

2021-09-27 07:31:00+00:00	Bitcoin prices, crypto markets shrug off China’s latest bans on crypto	['Michelle Lim', 'Danny Park', 'Author Profile', 'Michelle Is A Journalist At Forkast. Prior To Joining The Team', 'She Wrote For Cnn', 'Served With The Singapore Foreign Service. She Holds A Master Of Journalism The University Of Hong Kong', 'A Bachelor Of Business Administration The National University Of Singapore.', 'Danny Is A Journalist At Forkast.News. Originally South Korea', 'Danny Has Produced Content For Media Companies In Korea', 'Hong Kong']	"Crypto markets were up Monday morning in Asia, a quick recovery following China’s announcements on Friday banning cryptocurrency trading and mining and yesterday’s news that Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global would cease account registration for new users in mainland China and close down the accounts for existing mainland Chinese users by Dec. 31.

Bitcoin – the largest cryptocurrency by market value — dropped to US$40,936 on Friday following China’s announcements but has since rebounded 7%, now trading above US$44,000, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum, too, dropped from US$3,100 to US$2,747 on Friday, but is currently trading back above US$3,100.

News of China’s latest bans was followed immediately by a dip in the total cryptocurrency market — from approximately US$1.99 trillion in market capitalization on Sept. 24 to US$1.86 on Sept. 26, according to CoinMarketCap. The number has since climbed back to US$1.96 trillion.

“It’s a bit like the story of the guy who cries wolf, you know, too many times and then people stop caring. And so I think that’s what we’re seeing with the markets right now,” Justin d’Anethan, head of exchange sales at crypto exchange EQONEX told Forkast.News.

Positive news over the weekend — coming on top of market-reassuring news earlier in the week that China’s Evergrande Group had stepped back from falling off a potential debt cliff — also warded off bearish sentiments, Justin d’Anethan said. For instance, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele on Sunday tweeted that 2.1 million Salvadorans were actively using the Bitcoin Chivo wallet.

“There’s a lot of fundamentals that are still very good,” d’Anethan added. “And then the China story is kind of heard that, before been there, done that.”

Although the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index currently stands at “Fear,” crypto market experts told Forkast.News that they remain long-term bullish on cryptocurrencies despite China’s latest ban — the most expansive and detailed yet for the world’s most populous nation — on cryptocurrency trading.

“For China specifically, there’s going to be a lot less transactions,” d’Anethan said. But, he added: “Enthusiasm for crypto globally is big enough and growing enough that it’s going to kind of balance that out.”

Tony Sycamore, City Index’s senior market analyst for APAC, told Forkast.News that “China’s role disrupting crypto markets has about run its course.”

“While the announcement provided a setback to our bullish view, it’s not a surprise. Providing Bitcoin holds above last week’s US$39,573 low, the technical outlook remains positive,” Sycamore said. “A break and close above last week’s US$45,159 high and above the 200-day moving average at US$45,575 would further indicate a retest and break of the US$52,956 high is underway.”

The technical outlook remains positive for Ethereum, provided it holds above last week’s US$2,650 low, Sycamore added. “A break and close above resistance coming from last week’s highs at US$3,175 would be a strong indication the correction from the US$4,025 high is complete and the uptrend has resumed.”

With China’s ban directly targeting the operations of Chinese cryptocurrency exchange heavyweights such as Huobi and OKEx, prices of their tokens have plunged. Prices of the Huobi token have dropped by more than 40% over the past seven days, according to Coinmarketcap. OKEX’s OKB is down over 20% in the same period.

Tether (USDT), a stablecoin that is frequently used to facilitate trading or used by traders as a hedge against volatility in cryptocurrency prices, also saw increased volumes. Trading volumes of USDT were up over 20% in the past 24-hours according to Coinmarketcap.

But decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, in particular those of decentralized exchanges — such as Uniswap and Sushi, which facilitate cryptocurrency transactions without an intermediary — have surged. Uniswap’s UNI and Sushiswap’s SUSHI are up over 30% and 20% respectively as of publishing time, according to Coinmarketcap.

“DeFi will surely benefit from the recent regulatory headwinds from both China and the U.S. with its decentralized nature,” Rachel Lin, co-founder of decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures, told Forkast.News. “We are seeing users migrating to DeFi even when some CeFi platforms are still accessible due to concerns of counterparty risk. As more retail traders move to DEXs, liquidity will continue to improve and professional investors will start building more positions, thus creating a positive feedback loop and driving greater adoption.”

Other crypto market watchers said the most recent price volatility provided some investors with the opportunity to build up their positions.

“We saw some aggressive dip buying flows on the desk from our institutional and high net worth clients, which shows long-term optimism,” Annabelle Huang, partner at Amber Group, told Forkast.News."
2021-09-13 14:08:16+00:00	Fake News of Walmart Adopting Litecoin Causes Crypto Markets to Pump and Dump Billions in Minutes	['Anthonia Isichei', 'More Posts This Author', 'About The Author', 'Anthonia Is A Fintech Writer Who Has Been Involved In The Crypto Space Since Covering Developments Across Regulations', 'Adoption', 'Several Other Aspects Of The Industry. When Not Neck-Deep In The Crypto News Cycle', 'Anthonia Spends Her Free Time Globetrotting', 'Playing Video Games.']	"The entire cryptocurrency market pumped when news that the US-based e-commerce giant Walmart, has inked a partnership deal with Litecoin to enable its customers to make payment with LTC broke out. Unfortunately, the news appeared to be fake, and the market dumped subsequently.

According to the fake press release on Monday (September 13, 2021), Walmart shoppers would have soon been able to start making payments with LTC across all eCommerce stores.

The story was quickly picked up by major news outlets, including Reuters and CNBC, which, ironically, had this in the body before editing it out:

“It was not immediately clear if the news release was actually authentic.”

Interestingly enough, the sites that picked up the story failed to notice that the impostor credited the press release to Walmart-corpCom, which isn’t related to Walmart Inc. in any way.

This triggered a marketwide reaction, and most cryptocurrencies pumped tremendously in a matter of minutes. Bitcoin touched $47K, and Litecoin – the hero in the fake story touched $240.

In aggregate, the entire market added a whopping $80 billion in a matter of minutes.

Moments later, though, speculations ran rampant that the story is fake,, and it didn’t take long for LTC to plunge.

The price plunged to $175, and it currently trades around that level. This had the entire market lose about $100 billion in the minutes after.

It didn’t take long for CNBC and other media outlets to confirm that the story was fake.

A Walmart spokesperson confirmed that the press release wasn’t authentic."
2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin sinks below $43,000 as Evergrande fears sweep markets	['Vildana Hajric', 'Eddie Van Der Walt']	"Bitcoin got caught up in broader market fears about possible contagion should Chinese property developer Evergrande see a messy debt default.

Cryptocurrency prices slumped as a broad selloff sparked by worries about contagion from China Evergrande Group swept through global markets.

Bitcoin was down 8.1% to trade around $43,743 as of 5:11 p.m. in New York. It had dropped as much as as 10.7% earlier, which pushed it below $43,000 and to its lowest level since the beginning of August. Ether briefly dropped below $3,000. Popular DeFi tokens some of the biggest declines: Cardano fell more than 10% over the last 24 hours, as did Dogecoin, while Polkadot lost roughly 16%, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

The losses mirrored the action in the broader market as investors weighed the risks coming from Evergrande’s debt woes and this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. The S&P 500 fell 1.7% in its worst session since May, while European equities tumbled the most in more than two months.

“Some have attributed the sudden dip to the currently ongoing Evergrande situation in China which has already caused turmoil in traditional markets,” wrote Jonas Luethy, a sales trader at GlobalBlock, the U.K.-based digital asset broker. “Analysts have suggested a choppy week is ahead, with a potential pullback to as low as $41,000.”

The swiftness of the plunge was likely accelerated as more than 272,000 traders had their accounts liquidated over the past 24 hours, equal to around $1.3 billion worth of crypto, according to data from Bybt, a crypto futures trading and information platform.

“This is part of a well-established pattern where it sells off as traders cash in their riskier assets to cover margin calls and/or sit on the sidelines until markets calm down and they feel more comfortable going back into riskier positions,” said Leah Wald, CEO at Valkyrie Investments.

Chartists say Bitcoin could test its 100-day moving average, which currently sits around $40,655. Should it fall to that level, it could find support at $40,000. Still, other signals show it could be in for a reprieve: the coin fell below the lower limit on the Trading Envelope indicator, suggesting it dropped too far, too fast. And its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 39 shows it’s creeping toward oversold levels.

Although Bitcoin doesn’t always trade in tandem with financial markets — a characteristic that made it a tempting proposition from a portfolio-diversification point of view — its correlation on a 30-day basis to futures on the Nasdaq 100 has been consistently positive since February last year. A reading of 0.5 — which it’s close to now — means they’re moving in the same direction quite often these days.

Investors say that while a link with tech stocks make sense — both types of investments may be thought of as appealing to the same tech-savvy investor pool — strong correlations are also showing up for small-cap stocks and the S&P 500. That’s probably because as Bitcoin becomes more integrated in global financial markets, it should respond more to the changes in risk appetite that drives global sentiment.

Meanwhile, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele said the country had “bought the dip,” in Bitcoin, adding 150 tokens to raise its total holdings to 700 — about $32 million based on current pricing. The nation recently adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in a controversial move that met with technical glitches and protests.

“Not everyone is selling,” said Valkyrie’s Wald.

We just bought the dip. 150 new coins! El Salvador now holds 700 coins.#Bitcoin🇸🇻 — Nayib Bukele 🇸🇻 (@nayibbukele) September 20, 2021

El Salvador’s enthusiastic adoption of Bitcoin is one of the reasons why prices have been trending higher and recently hit a four-month high. Still, the market has a way to go before recovering losses since a selloff in May.

“On a day like today, where you have the perfect storm, I think people just go to, ‘What can I sell quickest? What do I have access to at 2 in the morning?,’” said Scott Bauer, chief executive officer at Prosper Trading Academy. “If they’re holding crypto, which is obviously an around-the-clock market, maybe that’s the first place they look,” he said, adding that the news out of China is a negative for the crypto space."
2021-09-07 00:00:00+00:00	Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are Falling Today	['Bram Berkowitz']	"What happened

The price of most cryptocurrencies fell on Tuesday morning after some hit new highs on Monday night. The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) had dropped roughly 11% as of noon EDT, while the prices of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) had fallen roughly 12% and 18%, respectively.

The fall in prices seemed to be attributed to market volatility commonly associated with the cryptocurrencies, and as El Salvador looks to implement a law today that will see Bitcoin accepted as legal tender.

So what

Just before falling this morning, Bitcoin hit its highest price level since May at $52,000. Ethereum had traded close to $4,000 on Monday night, while Dogecoin at one point hit over $0.31 per token.

The price drops come on the day that the Latin American country El Salvador is set to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, making it the first country to do so. What this means is that citizens in the country can choose to use Bitcoin as payment and businesses must accept it in exchange for goods and services. In addition, citizens will be able to pay taxes in Bitcoin, Bitcoin exchanges will not be subject to capital gains taxes, and the price of Bitcoin will be tied to the dollar exchange rate.

In preparation for the new law, which is set to go in effect at 3 p.m. EDT today, the El Salvador government has purchased roughly $20 million in Bitcoin and installed 200 Bitcoin ATMs across the country. Government-run Bitcoin wallets will be loaded with $30 worth of Bitcoin for citizens who register. Reuters reported this morning that the El Salvador government ""had to unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand,"" as citizens register for the wallets.

Despite the issues, Leah Wald, CEO at the cryptocurrency and alternative asset management firm Valkryie Investments, said she was not surprised by the market's reaction today, as the news surrounding El Salvador has already been priced in.

""When this move was first announced, it didn't have nearly as big of an impact on price as some may have expected it might, possibly because El Salvador's population is less than New York City's, but also because the announcement was light on details and people were on the fence about how this was going to be implemented,"" Wald told CNBC. ""Transaction fees, processing times, and other hurdles also make this feel more like a beta test rather than a solution to many of the problems plaguing the country's poor.""

Wald added that if other Latin American countries begin accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, that could result in a ""parabolic"" move higher in crypto prices. Many experts believe Latin America could be ripe for adopting cryptocurrencies to help improve money transmission and for central banks that already deal with volatile currencies.

Now what

While the situation in El Salvador will be interesting to watch, I do not see anything that would change my view on certain cryptocurrencies.

I still feel quite bullish on Bitcoin and Ethereum. I am less bullish on Dogecoin, but can acknowledge that the cryptocurrency will likely move in tandem with the broader crypto market, and that it could move higher as stakeholders continue to update the network.

2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00	Why Cryptocurrencies Dropped Today	['Rich Smith']	"What happened

The week is drawing to a close, and cryptocurrencies are once again trading lower. Here's how prices look for the three biggest names in cryptocurrency as of 9:50 a.m.:

Bitcoin BTC 1.05% )

Dogecoin DOGE 1.83% )

And Ethereum ETH 3.48% )

So what

Once again, it seems government regulation is to blame. Coindesk's lead article this morning discusses a new report from the European Securities and Markets Authority (the European counterpart to the SEC) in which the ESMA criticizes the ""soaring"" environmental costs of mining cryptocurrencies, as well as the dangers posed by ""highly volatile"" cryptocurrency prices, and the ""prolonged period of risk to institutional and retail investors"" that result from this.

According to Coindesk, the European Union is working on a slew of ""all-encompassing cryptocurrency regulations, new anti-money laundering (AML) rules and tax reporting requirements for virtual asset service providers and investors."" While the legislation reserves its ""harsh[est] restrictions"" for stablecoins (which are pegged to the value of another currency such as the U.S. dollar), Coindesk says that the legislation, once passed, will be ""sweeping"" in scope and regulate cryptocurrency markets across all 27 member states of the EU.

Now what

Nor is regulation coming just to the EU. In a separate note today, Cointelegraph.com reports that ""Russia is moving to regulate cryptocurrency mining."" But in what I believe may be a continuing theme in crypto in the weeks and months ahead, this isn't entirely bad news.

Cryptocurrency mining ""is a type of entrepreneurial activity,"" says Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets Chairman Anatoly Aksakov, and ""it is obviously necessary to include it into the state register, to regulate it as a type of entrepreneurship under an appropriate code, and impose relevant taxation."" In so doing, Aksakov echoed the sentiment expressed by Russia's neighbor to the west, where Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov was quoted yesterday expressing the hope that Ukraine's regulation of cryptocurrencies will cause ""entrepreneurs [to] pay taxes to the budget, but will be protected by the state.""

And this, in a nutshell, is how I see cryptocurrency regulation playing out over time. Governments will regulate the cryptocurrency industry, yes. They'll tax it too. But as they do so, they'll become dependent on the tax revenue that cryptocurrency generates, and therefore work to institutionalize cryptocurrency so as to not lose that revenue stream.

While cryptocurrency investors may not love the idea of government regulation, ultimately I think this trend will work to their good."
2021-09-07 19:55:00+00:00	Crypto Market Crashes, Bitcoin Falls to $42,800	[]	"A crash in the cryptocurrency market! Just yesterday we analyzed Bitcoin’s bullish breakout above the long-term $51,200 area, and today the largest cryptocurrency fell to a low of $42,800.

Other cryptocurrencies are losing even more. Most of them lost around 30% of their value today. The only altcoin from the TOP 10 that is not worried about the declines and continues to soar is Solana.

Bitcoin loses 19%

Bitcoin (BTC) fell 19% today from the peak at $53,000 to the low at $42,800. The price fell sharply between 15:00 and 17:00 CET, after BTC began to close consecutive hourly candles below the long-term $51,200 area. Moreover, this level coincides with the 0.618 Fib retracement of the entire downward movement in May.

The cascading drops ended in the area of long-term support of $42,800, which is the horizontal support level at the 0.382 Fib retracement (green rectangle). Thus, if this level is lost in the following days, the next support is in the area of $37,500, at the 0.236 Fib retracement level.

The sharp capitulation was followed by a significant upward rebound of 10%. Bitcoin quickly returned to the 0.5 Fib retracement area and is trading at $46,800 at the press time.

Sponsored Sponsored

The decline took place on relatively high volume, which could signal the beginning of a bearish impulse. If this happens, the drops could continue until the price validates again the $42,800 area as support.

The chance of this scenario is reinforced by the loss of important support at the 0.618 Fib retracement. Two days ago there was a false – as it turned out today – breakout when BTC clearly broke above the $51,200 level. Typically, this is a very bearish signal that strengthens the intensity of a downward movement.

Altcoins bleed harder

Almost all of the major altcoins saw drastic declines today, usually larger than Bitcoin. For example, counting through the entire length of the candle including wicks, Ethereum (ETH) lost 24% today and recorded a bottom at $3 009, Cardano (ADA) 30% with a bottom at $2, Chainlink (LINK) 33% and $23.79, and Dogecoin (DOGE) 31% and $0.21.

Sponsored Sponsored

Data from CoinGecko shows that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by more than 14% today. In the morning, the value of the market oscillated around $2.48 trillion, only to fall to the vicinity of $2.14 trillion for the time being.

The only top altcoin that seems unconcerned about the market tumble is Solana (SOL). Solana opened the day at $164, recorded a brief bottom at $128 to trade at $173 at the press time.

The coming hours and days will show the significance and consequences of today’s crash. It remains to be seen whether this is just a temporary correction and a bearish trap for too many long leveraged positions, or the beginning of a more significant change in trend."
2021-09-07 15:35:04+00:00	Bitcoin Crashes 10% in Hours as Crypto Market Sheds $300 Billion	['Decrypt', 'Andrew Hayward']	"In brief The cryptocurrency market is widely correcting today, with a nearly 10% drop in market cap over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin has shed all of its gains over the last week, while Ethereum and Solana are still in the green over the past seven days as of this writing.

Prices across the cryptocurrency market tumbled early Tuesday, with Bitcoin and the wider market seeing a nearly 10% drop over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The combined value of the crypto market has dropped from above $2.4 trillion to $2.1 trillion, with Bitcoin itself now falling below a $1 trillion market cap.

Today’s correction followed a full week of steady gains, with a 16% increase in overall market cap from August 30 to September 6. During that time, Ethereum (ETH) inched closer to its all-time high marker, Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $50,000 mark again, and Solana (SOL) continually set new peak prices as its recent surge continued.

Solana is still up 38% on the week, as of this writing, while Ethereum is up about 2%. However, all of Bitcoin’s gains over the last week have been erased.

The sudden shift in market sentiment could be attributed, among other reasons, to a case of “buy the rumor, sell the news” related to El Salvador’s anticipated adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, which happened today. Bitcoin’s price continued to climb over the weekend in anticipation of the action, reaching levels not seen since May’s market-wide crash.

However, now that the day has come, Bitcoin is tanking—and taking most of the market with it. Bitcoin is now down 11% over the last 24 hours at a current price of $46,303.

Ethereum, meanwhile, has shed 16% of its value over the last 24 hours, dropping to a current price of $3,311. It was brushing up against the $4,000 level in recent days, including earlier this morning.

Cardano (ADA), the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is down 20% over the last 24 hours. That steeper decline has apparently been driven by questions regarding the platform’s ability to handle smart contracts, or the bits of code that perform set instructions and power decentralized apps such as peer-to-peer lending and trading services. ADA currently sits at a price of $2.27.

However, other coins in the top 10 have seen steeper declines over the last day. Binance Coin (BNB) is down 23% to $385, Dogecoin is down 23% to $0.24, and Polkadot is down 25% to just under $26.

It’s nearly all red in the market today, but it remains to be seen how long this correction will last—and how deep it will cut."
2021-09-04 09:24:51+00:00	Crypto market grows 47% in 30 days adding $0.7 trillion of inflows	['Jordan Major']	"After a turbulent couple of months, the cryptocurrency market has surged by 47% in the previous 30 days, adding $0.73 trillion in value.

Indeed, the crypto market value is now worth $2.28 trillion, up 2.27% in one day. Quantitatively, the crypto market volume has risen by 4.81% to $134.82 billion in the previous 24 hours. As a result of the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), the total volume in DeFi is presently $14.96 billion, or 11.1% of the entire 24-hour volume in the crypto market.

Moreover, analyzing the cryptocurrency market during the last month reveals the market was worth $1.55 trillion on August 4 and is now worth $2.28 trillion on September 4, representing a stunning $730 billion influx in only 30 days which is a 47% increase, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

Ethereum driving the market

​​According to the Chainalysis CEO Michael Gronager, the driving force behind the rise in the market is Ethereum which has recently upgraded its network; in turn, he stated:

“We’ve seen the trend of DeFi that’s been growing and growing, and that’s been pumping the interest in Ethereum, and Ethereum is then dragging along a lot of the other cryptocurrencies with it.”

In agreement with Gronager is Michael van de Poppe; he feels Ethereum is the most dominant cryptocurrency on the market right now.

#Ethereum is the leader of the pack. When that one goes up, #Bitcoin, and the rest follows.



That's currently the case. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 3, 2021

Larger platform modifications to the Ethereum network stabilized and improved the network in different ways, therefore facilitating increased trust in Ethereum in general.

As of August 5th, the “London” hard fork of Ethereum (the technology behind the ether cryptocurrency) was updated. The upgrade to the digital ledger – and the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency – alters the computation of transaction fees for the better.

In order to reduce the quantity of ether in circulation and perhaps increase its price, each transaction fee is burnt or removed from circulation.

Currently, Ethereum is trading at $3,947, up 3.37% in the last 24 hours and up 21.79% in the last week.

Solana hits all-time high

A lot of money in the last 30 days has flocked into Solana (SOL) in the past year, interest in the term “Solana” has increased by 354.54%, according to Google Trends (YTD). The surge in searches coincides with the price of tokens, which reached an all-time high of $149 on September 4. Beyond Google Trends, our prior report indicated that the token’s popularity and volume were at an all-time high.

A number of causes are driving Solana’s value, with the move into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) emerging as the probable top driver. In the wake of the Degenerate Apes NFT collection release, interest in the asset has grown. For producers and token holders in the asset ecosystem, the publication became a focal point of interest.

A substantial number of well-performing projects are also being attracted to the network, which currently competes with Ethereum. In addition to supporting the NFT endeavor, the ecosystem also supports the expanding decentralized finance industry.

Investors may be searching for alternatives to Ethereum’s network, despite its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency. A notable example is that Ethereum is now undergoing improvements. Consequently, the network has recently experienced congestion and high transaction costs; as a result, investors and developers are looking for alternatives.

Currently, Solana is trading at $147.15, up 2.18% in the last 24 hours and up 67.93% in the last week.

Bitcoin breaks past $50,000

Finally, the flagship digital asset has once again achieved $50,000 as it looks to set all-time highs. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is changing hands at $50,121, up 1.54% on the day and 2.21% in the last week.

For many crypto trading experts, $51,000 is now the level to break above for further bullish momentum crypto trader Josh Rager considers that there is not much resistance up to the mid $50,000s.

In fact, Bitcoin began a bull run earlier this year, but it reversed in May due to increasing crackdowns from countries such as China.

However, there has been an uptick in interest since Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced at the B-Word conference that Tesla would likely accept Bitcoin payments again in the future. A few months ago, Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin due to concerns about its environmental impact.

Since the B-Word conference, Bitcoin has been on an upward trend, with many trading experts predicting that it could exceed $100,000 before the conclusion of the bull run as more institutions and nations accept the digital asset."

The cryptocurrency market is attempting a modest recovery today after subsequent days of selling. The prices of both BTC and ETH have gained 2.3% — driving the global cryptocurrency market capitalization up 2.6%. Meanwhile, TRX is leading major altcoins with an 11.4% gain.

Dominating industry headlines yesterday and today is the publication of fake news from a series of mainstream media and cryptocurrency-focused news outlets. The news — which was published by CoinDesk, Decrypt, Blockworks, CNBC, Reuters, Zerohedge and Bloomberg — claimed that retail giant Walmart had partnered with Litecoin after a now-deleted fake press release was published by GlobeNewswire.

Following the publication of the fake news, the price of LTC surged from roughly $175 to upward of $230 across global cryptocurrency exchanges before almost entirely retracing.

NFT Snapshot: Fragments of an Infinite Field latest AB hit

The nonfungible token space was smitten yesterday with the latest Art Blocks Curated release, “Fragments of an Infinite Field” by artist Monica Rizzolli. The Dutch auction made 1,623 ETH — around $5.38 million at the time of the sale — in less than an hour.

Though Art Blocks Curated releases are almost universally popular, Rizzolli’s has garnered significant buzz — with many in the NFT space praising the artistic merits of the generative works.

BTC technical analysis: Trying to recover

The price of BTC is attempting a recovery but may run into trouble at the bottom of a wide resistance zone and the top of the four-hour ribbon of exponential moving averages. Reentry into the wide resistance zone would be welcomed by those bullish on the foremost cryptocurrency, while failure to do so could spark a new wave of sellers.

ETH technical analysis: Putting in lower highs

The price of ETH continues to put in lower highs against BTC, suggesting that further declines may be in store for the trading pair. Adding pressure is the four-hour EMA ribbon, which is currently above ETHBTC and adds further bearish bias on lower time frames.

Link copied to

Bitcoin fell four per cent in less than half an hour this afternoon, as risk assets around the world drop on fears over fallout from the looming default of Chinese property developer Evergrande.

BTC fell from US$47,200 to as low as US$45,200 from 12.26pm AEST to 13.05pm, mirroring a plunge in Australian and Asian equities and US futures.

At 4.16pm AEDT, Bitcoin was trading at US$45,773, down 4.7 per cent from 24 hours ago.

“This is a risk-off move,” City Index analyst Tony Sycamore told Ausbiz TV this afternoon. “We’ve got the third leg of a correction playing out currently.”

Looking at it through an Elliot Wave framework, Sycamore predicted that BTC could drop as low as US$40,000, “give or take one thousand”, before heading higher.

“I still like Bitcoin in the bigger picture, so this for me would be a corrective pullback within an uptrend,” he said.

It’s a “phenomenal” buying opportunity for bulls, Sycamore said, although adding that people who are already long crypto might not be as happy. He was predicting another four or five per cent drop.

Perth-based ThinkMarkets analyst Carl Capolingua tweeted that uncertainty over Evergrande and losses from Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were leaking into crypto markets.

He also saw BTC’s long-term uptrend intact, but the short-term momentum has been lost, he wrote. He recommended staying out of the market until BTC had climbed to US$48,818 or dropped to US$42,582.

But Bitcoin chartist Mick Krypto saw some reason for optimism.

97 of top 100 coins down

Overall the crypto market was down 5.7 per cent to US$2.1 trillion, with Ethereum dropping 6.8 per cent to a nine-day low of US$3,191.

Seventeen of the top 100 coins were down by double-digits, while just three had gained ground.

The biggest loser was Algorand, the No. 19 coin, which was down 14.6 per cent to US$1.81.

THORChain, Hedera Hashgraph, Icon and Waves were close behind, all falling 12 to 14 per cent.

On the flip side, Cosmos (ATOM) was the biggest gainer, rising 5.5 per cent to US$41.32.

Osmosis, a decentralised exchange built on Cosmos that’s a recent addition to the top 100, gained 4.3 per cent to US$7.16.

Both coins had hit all-time highs a little after lunchtime (Sydney time), at US$44.42 and US$7.61, respectively.

Currently the No. 16 coin on Coingecko, Cosmos is an interconnected “internet of blockchains” – an ecosystem of sovereign blockchain apps connected by the Cosmos Hub.

Compound Dai had also edged slightly higher.

2021-09-08 11:32:53+00:00	Blockster, the Future of Social Networking in the Crypto Market	[]	"As, back in 2017, Facebook and Google – the world’s biggest advertising platforms – announced a blanket ban on crypto advertising, major crypto companies were left with little to no ways of reaching their target audience. In order to connect with their communities, these companies took to Medium, Twitter, and Reddit. Even though most of them still rely on these platforms, the data there is scattered, which makes it challenging to efficiently navigate it.

From the crypto enthusiasts’ point of view, up until recently, there’s been a lack of a single, reliable source of information. One had to rely on platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to track the performance of their favorite projects, go to Reddit to discuss them, get the latest industry updates on Medium and Twitter, or watch influencers reviews on YouTube. So we were left with a disintegrated social landscape for an emerging market, which made it difficult for traders and creators to communicate, assess the information, or monetize their content – and this is exactly where Blockster comes in to fill the gap.

A Thriving Community For the Rising Market

According to the project’s whitepaper, the word ‘blockster’ stands for a crypto-centric or a business using the Blockster platform to connect, create, earn and learn. It perfectly sums up the platform’s mission: to connect all the blocksters of the world: crypto enthusiasts, content creators, entrepreneurs, and investors, so they can get the latest industry news, share their ideas and content, collaborate, keep a track of all their crypto investments in a single techy and trendy space.

Blockster is a multi-purpose platform built to connect and empower the ever-growing crypto industry. It has its own social network, discussion groups, industry-grade crypto tracking sub-platform and many more features to be added soon. At the time of this writing, the platform already has a waitlist of over 414,000 eager users and over 150 partners, including such prominent projects as Chainlink, Enjin, Zilliqa, and NEWSBTC.

With new partners joining literally every day, Blockster plans to incorporate all major crypto projects in the upcoming months. As this happens, it will imminently become a one-stop-shop for all things crypto; the go-to platform for anyone who wants to learn, invest or earn money within the space.

Embracing the Latest Trends

Sharing the same vibe with the young and fluid crypto space, Blockster is evolving together with it, as it keeps adding new features which are most in-demand across the community. In Q4 2021, it plans to roll out a digital wallet, a mobile app, and release a self-serve advertising system.

BXR, At The Heart of the Ecosystem

The vibrant Blockster ecosystem is powered by the BXR token that is uniquely positioned to increase in value with time. As the Blockster community grows, it is bound to become a stable cryptocurrency backed by millions of loyal users.

BXR will be the only currency used to pay for advertising on Blockster. The platform plans to start testing the advertisement platform at the end of this year and accept payment for ads starting Q1 2022. By the end of the first quarter, Blockster expects to have over 450 partners placing their ads on the platform.

Through ads, the platform will offer an excellent growth point for businesses, providing them with a space to get more exposure and connect directly with their target audience. Blockster in turn will redistribute 20% of all of its ad revenue to its community of stakers. Every month, 5% of BXR collected as ad revenue also is burned, ensuring the appreciation of its value.

Blockster is the networking platform for cryptocurrency professionals, investors, traders and enthusiasts. Essentially, it is a marketing tool for crypto-centric businesses and individuals. Not only does the platform allow users to network and market themselves within the platform, but it also provides the latest industry news, coin tracking for the entire cryptocurrency market, as well as, a real-time messaging application for P2P and group chatting.

Blockster Holdings is a parent company of Blockster. The initial seed investors, based in the UK and UAE, invested $1.9 million in 2020, valuing the company at $25 million."
2021-09-22 03:52:22+00:00	Why September is seen as a bad month for cryptocurrencies	[]	"Cryptocurrencies are experiencing their second sell-off in September. With China’s Evergrande crisis sparking fears of a massive global asset sell-off, Bitcoin saw a 24-hour low of $40,267 before regaining slightly to close out at slightly over $43,000 for 1 BTC. But Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to see a dip for the second time in the month. Ether, XRP and Cardano are all down over both a week-long period and over the month.

This is not the first time that cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, have been in the red in the month of September. The September bearish market for crypto has been observed over the past four years.

Also read:

Something about September?

However, the phenomenon is not isolated to cryptocurrency assets. The stock market has historically performed the worst in the month of September. The US stock market indices, which track the performance of the stock market by tracking the price of share prices of some of the biggest companies in the US, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500, and the NASDAQ, have performed the worst in the month of September. The effect is well-recorded enough where it has been termed the September Effect.

While many have theorised about what causes the September Effect, there is no consensus on what causes the effect. It has been observed that the effect has been dissipating over the past few years, and in some years stock markets have managed to even grow during September contrary to beliefs of a constant bear market.

Most believe that the September Effect is a prime example of market psychology, where enough investors believe in the idea of the bear market in the month and thus sell off their stocks. This sell-off results in a dip in prices which further reinforces the idea of the September effect.

The Bitcoin case

Similarly, in the case of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, there is no particular reason as to why September has been a ‘bad’ month. For September 2021 in particular, the cryptocurrency market has been in a volatile state since the start of the year, and even slight changes in global situations have produced significant effects on crypto prices.

In September, the potential fallout of Evergrande in China, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador and South Korea’s shuttering of crypto exchanges have had major effects on the price of the prime cryptocurrency. These effects have had a more tangible influence on Bitcoin prices than the mythical September Effect.

While many investors and crypto enthusiasts swear by the effect, the likely explanation from the previous five years of poor performance in the month is just a random chance that many individuals try to fit into a false pattern."
2021-09-22 04:10:54+00:00	Cryptocurrency news: Bitcoin falls below $40,000, all about Ether	[]	"The concerns around cryptocurrency saw Bitcoin on Wednesday dropping briefly below $40,000 for the first time since August in volatile trading. This is the third consecutive day of fall for the virtual currency.

Rivals including Ether and Litecoin also slumped.

“Bitcoin needs to retake the 200-day moving average at $46,000 and consolidate before a collective sigh can be released,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo told news agency Reuters.

The fall was a result of a discussion on cryptocurrencies on Tuesday where US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said past instances of banks and other firms offering private forms of money have failed.

Gensler reiterated that US securities rules give his agency great authority over digital tokens. He also said there are some “gaps” in oversight of digital tokens that Congress could help close, such as regulating crypto exchanges.

Bitcoin is still getting the bulk of inflows at $15.3 million, data from digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Monday. It further showed that inflows were seen across the board.

Digital currency inflows for 2021 were a still a robust $5.96 billion.

There are many cryptocurrencies, blockchain platforms and exchanges which have gained prominence in recent years. These are: Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL). After bitcoin, the most popular one is Etherium.

According to Mint, Ethereum is is not a blockchain, or a cryptocurrency. It is actually a protocol (a set of rules or procedures). The original Ethereum split into two blockchains - Ethereum and Ethereum Classic - after the 2016 Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) hack.

Ether (ETH) is the world's second-largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin. Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.

The most popular Ethereum tokens are Stablecoins, which mirror the value of fiat currencies like the US dollars, governance tokens, which represent voting power in decentralised organizations and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent a collectible piece of digital art."
2021-09-22 15:45:00+00:00	The Crypto Market is Down — Why Are Prices Falling?	[]	"Denis Goncharenko

Bitcoin price had fallen as high as 10.7 percent earlier this week, pushing it to below $43,000, and then to its lowest point since August's beginning. Ether was briefly below $3,000. The most well-known DeFi tokens have seen some of the most notable decreases: Cardano fell more than 10% in the last 24 hours, and so did Dogecoin and Polkadot dropped around 16%, as per CoinMarketCap.com.

The losses were mirrored by the volatility on the global market as investors assessed the potential risks posed by Evergrande's debt problems and next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7 percent during its most tense session since May, and European equity markets fell the most in the past two months.

Some have attributed the recent decline to the ongoing Evergrande crisis in China that has already caused chaos in the market sectors that are accustomed to it. Analysts have indicated that a turbulent week ahead, including an eventual pullback that could be the low of $41,000.

The rapidity of the crash was likely to be accelerated by the fact that nearly 272,000 investors saw their accounts wiped out in the last 24 hours, which is about $1.3 billion in crypto, as per data from Bybt the crypto futures exchange and platform for information.

The occurrence has hit brokerage companies, as well, many of which had to provide a comprehensive explanation to their clients of what happened and why it has happened. Almost all of the service providers listed on BitcoinCapital have seen active trading of the most popular cryptos during the past few hours. Even though the picture seems worrying, experts still hold hopes.

Analysts from Chartists believe Bitcoin could be able to test its 100-day moving mean, which is currently around $40,655. If it falls to that point the coin could find support at $40,000. But other signals suggest that it's likely to get an opportunity to rebound: the currency dropped below the lower limit of the Trading Envelope indicator, suggesting that it fell too much, too quickly. The one-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 39 indicates that it is moving towards oversold levels.

Investors think that although the connection between tech stocks and Bitcoin is logical because both kinds of investments are considered attractive to the same investor group that is tech-savvy, strong correlations are also being observed for small-cap stocks as well as those in the S&P 500. It's likely because Bitcoin is more integrated into the global financial market and is more able to respond to changes in risk appetite which determines the global mood.

The president of El Salvador Nayib Bukele claimed that the nation has ""bought the dip"" with Bitcoin by adding 150 tokens, which brought its total assets to 700, which is around $32 million, based on the current price. El Salvador is currently implementing Bitcoin as a legal tender, a move that was met with technical issues and protests.

""Not all investors are selling,"" said Valkyrie's Wald.

El Salvador's enthusiastic embrace of Bitcoin is among the main reasons that prices have been rising and recently hit the four-month mark. But, the market has a long way to go before it can recover losses after the selloff that occurred in May."

A massive spike in volatility in the cryptocurrency market sunk the values of popular virtual coins including Bitcoin and Ether. The virtual coin market was painted in red on Wednesday after cryptocurrency prices plunged a day ago due to delays in trading.

The delay was observed after El Salvador ran into snags after becoming the first country to officially adopt Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, as legal tender.

Shares of blockchain-related firms also fell after trading was impacted by outages. However, the major reason behind the fall in cryptocurrency valuations was the El Salvador government’s move to temporarily unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.

Bitcoin was trading at $45,474.51, down over 13.48 per cent compared to its value 24 hours at 12:00 pm. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation fell sharply to $855 billion and the trading volume over the past 24 hours rose to 3.19 billion. The jump in trading volume was primarily due to a heavy sell-off.

Ether mirrored Bitcoin and slipped after gaining momentum over the past few weeks. It was trading at $3,352.38, down 14.45 per cent. Ether’s market capitalisation fell below $400 as a result. Like Bitcoin, Ether’s trading volume rose due to higher sell-off.

All other altcoins encountered huge losses due to the trading delays. This was the first substantial fall in the value of altcoins after an impressive rally.

Commenting on the crash, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “It was a massively volatile 24 hours for the cryptocurrency investors. Bitcoin fell from $52,900 to just over $43,000 in a very short span. This event caused a massive liquidation as more than 329,000 investors and traders got liquidated.”

“The largest altcoin, Ether, quickly replicated Bitcoin's move. However, there was some recovery later in the session. Some Bitcoin whales seem to have bought the dip as the price recovered a bit immediately following the drop,” he added.

“President of El Salvador tweeted that they added 150 Bitcoins during the dip.”

BITCOIN OVERVIEW

BTC ended the month of July with a distinct spike in price that many bulls were hoping for after two months of sideways market. This 8-consecutive-days price surge marked the general uptrend for the month of August, some minor corrections of up to 10% happening along the way. End of month BTC is coming close to support levels at USD $47.5K after having tested the psychological resistance level of US $50K on Aug 23rd, a price level which had not been seen since mid-May.

Testing the uptrend’s support levels represents profit taking happening in the market after a 70% surge since July 20th.

During the August uptrend BTC Open Interest grew at a faster pace than the price of the underlying. This signifies opening of new OI positions on the long end given that the funding rate is in the positive territory. At the same time, looking at relatively low and stable funding rate environment and futures spot basis, it seems the market does not yet have the strength to bounce back to meet the resistance levels at $56K. The current return to sideways drift might lead to a further consolidation period extending into the beginning of September.

Macroeconomic uncertainty with growing tapering concern had an impact on the cryptocurrency markets and will likely extend into the next month ahead of the Fed’s meeting on September 21/22.

ETHEREUM OVERVIEW

London fork finally introduced the long-awaited EIP-1559 upgrade to Ethereum on August 5. EIP-1559 will ensure that a portion of Ethereum’s gas fees will be burnt, with the rest going to miners, thus creating a case for the asset’s scarcity. Given the growing institutional and retail adoption of Ethereum, London upgrade was an important milestone to ensure the cryptocurrency’s future success. This upgrade was priced in in the ETH upwards trend lasting from July 21st through to mid-August.

The price had a steady run breaking 100d MA at $2,550 to shot upwards and peak at $3,378 on August 23rd. In one month between July 20 and August 23 ETH appreciated by more than 96% rallying all the way from $1,720 up to $3,378. ETH is currently in a consolidation period following the overall crypto market, gathering foundation for its next move.

EIP-1559 Detailed

London upgrade finally introduced the long-awaited EIP-1559 upgrade to Ethereum. EIP-1559 will ensure that a portion of Ethereum’s gas fees will be burnt, with the rest going to miners. This upgrade was priced in in the upwards trend lasting from July 21 through to mid-August.

Which impact will EIP-1559 have on the Ethereum network for users?

1. It promises to provide a predictable fee-payment experience creating less cases of massive fee overpayment on the network.

2. The new base-fee burning mechanism will enforce the reduction in ETH issuance decreasing the crypto’s inflation rate.

Ethereum’s fee market today is based on first price auction where fees can fluctuate drastically depending on competing transactions pricing. To solve these issues, EIP-1559 introduces a predictable base-fee mechanism. Coindesk Research report explains this upgrade as follows:

“The base fee is the minimum gas price required for users to send a transaction or complete an operation on Ethereum under EIP 1559. It fluctuates in accordance to how much space is being utilized per block on Ethereum. Ideally, each block on Ethereum would contain a maximum of 15 million gas. However, in times of network congestion, EIP 1559 would allow block sizes to increase up to twice this amount.

These adjustments over the long term are designed to ensure gas usage on Ethereum trends towards an average of roughly 15 million gas per block.”

Since the implementation of the London Hard Fork, Ethereum network has already burned over 150 thousand ETH worth around US $500 million.

THE CASE FOR CARDANO

In the month of August, ADA increased in price by over 110%, rallying from around $1.3 in the beginning of the month to $2.8 by the month’s end. In dollar terms, Cardano has seen the strongest growth in the crypto space, gaining more than US $45 billion in market cap over the course of one month.

So what is Cardano and why is it so special? Launched in 2017, Cardano is the second largest blockchain supporting Smart Contracts functionality, providing a platform for crypto projects and decentralized applications. At the moment of writing, Smart Contracts have not been deployed on Cardano’s blockchain yet, however seem to be imminent according to the developers’ updates. The time schedule is September following the completion of Alonzo hard fork. (Read More)

Source: youtube.com | IOHK

With the launch of Smart Contracts, Cardano expects to become superior to Ethereum: while the latter is only transitioning to the Proof of Stake protocol, Cardano is already successfully running it. In fact, Cardano is currently the world’s largest proof of stake blockchain by market cap.

One of Cardano’s most obvious advantages is the project’s high degree of decentralization. Cardano’s 3,000 stake pool operators are responsible for 100% of block production. The higher the number of block producers on the network, the higher degree of security they provide making the 51% attack highly unlikely.

The distribution of ADA in circulation is yet another evidence of the project’s preference for decentralization, with only 16% of crypto assets belonging to the team & founders and 84% sitting in the hands of investors.

In the month of August, ADA appreciated by over 110%, rallying from around $1.3 in the beginning of the month to $2.8 by the month’s end.

SOLANA’S RALLY

Solana is the next competitor for dominance in the Smart Contracts space, growing SOL at mind-blowing 224% in the month of August. This price increase added roughly US $24 billion in the crypto’s market capitalization.

Solana is also a relatively new web-scale blockchain designed to provide fast, secure and scalable apps and marketplaces. The focus is the transaction speed, which Solana solves with the Proof of History mechanism. It assigns a time-stamp for each transaction to achieve scalability and high throughput.

Solana is ahead of its closest competitors like Polkadot or Cardano, since the project had already deployed the Smart Contracts functionality and has multiple projects running live on its network. We have seen the benefits of having leading projects in its ecosystem during the August SOL rally following the news of Degenerate Apes — Solana’s NFT project — going viral (Read More), and Audius partnering with TikTok (Read More).

Volatility and Correlations

GOVERNMENTS & REGULATION: US

August has been rich with the US regulators tacking the safety and control in the crypto markets.

On August 3rd SEC chairman Gary Gensler spoke openly about cryptocurrency regulation at the Aspen Security Forum. Gensler highlighted the SEC’s authority in overseeing the crypto market and the need for further rules with regards to crypto exchanges, lending platforms, DeFi and stablecoins. A hot topic for the upcoming future is determining whether a crypto asset is a security and thus must be registered with SEC. (Read More)

A bright note of Gensler’s crypto discussion was his hint to review bitcoin ETF proposals to include bitcoin futures traded on CME. And while hopes for an SEC-regulated bitcoin ETF remain a dream, a bitcoin futures ETF is close to becoming a reality. After this announcement, asset managers rushed to rewrite and file proposals for bitcoin Futures ETFs, including Valkyrie, VanEck, Galaxy Digital, Invesco, ProShares and other. (Read More)

Infrastructure Bill

In the beginning of the month, market’s concern was around the Senate’s Infrastructure Bill narrowing a cryptocurrency tax reporting provision that would raise $28 billion over 10 years.

The Bill has a rather broad and unclear definition of a ‘broker’: it could encompass any entity facilitating crypto transactions (including miners, hardware and software developers) and would make financial reporting and disclosures mandatory for these ‘crypto brokers’. Two amendments were proposed to narrow the scope of provision exempting miners, validators and entities that do not provide custody and trading services. Interesting point is that one of these amendments tried to exempt only proof-of-work validators, which could be interpreted as implicit backing of Bitcoin as opposed to Ethereum. (Read More)

In the end the Senate failed to amend crypto wording in the Bill leaving the new cryptocurrency tax requirements quite controversial. As usual in a bull market, the news was taken with a positive attitude of ‘we lost the battle but not the war’. Market participants claim that Washington expanding tax regulation to crypto is a sign of long-term regulatory acceptance and even support. (Read More)

Seasoned traders are sure that BTC and other cryptos will still win.

Many crypto believers share their thoughts via Twitter.

As the crypto market has gone bearish on us today, basic traders and investors are once again — to no one’s surprise, showing skepticism. Every time the market shows the slightest dip, the community panics in fear of their investments falling.

Of course, the viewpoint is totally different when it comes to seasoned traders, long-time hodlers, and firm crypto believers. A Twitter post from the reputed crypto investor — Lark Davis, leads to an interesting thread.

Fed news, China fears, and upcoming infrastructure bill are all weighing heavy on the market. #crypto #bitcoin — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) September 20, 2021

From this, we can see that most seasoned traders are wary of the current trials the crypto market is facing. Still, they are sure of the power and capabilities of cryptos.

In particular, Lark Davis highlights some issues that plague the crypto industry. For instance, he talks about the upcoming infrastructure bill, China’s continued efforts to hinder crypto adoption, and other government efforts to limit crypto activities.

Many replies to the tweet speculate the cause for another dip. Some say this is because investors are dumping cryptos to take profits. However, this cannot be the case for many big cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC). Most Bitcoin holders have been and will continue to hold their assets.

Meanwhile, other related tweets include a steady and strong drive by other believers who continue to invest and hold crypto assets. For one, Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador tweets that they bought 150 more BTC. Now, the country holds 700 Bitcoins.

This is a testament to the president’s faith in Bitcoin. He continues to buy BTC even after citizens marched out to protest its adoption as a legal tender. Bukele says Bitcoin will make remittance payments faster and cheaper, others say it will power corruption.

Another interesting tweet states that banks have been powering corruption for years but no one seems to care about that. Lark Davis chimes in again saying, “the government is obsessed with keeping people poor”.

Finally, Michael Saylor — CEO of MicroStrategy, tweets saying Bitcoin will win. In fact, he says that all forms of technology will be the ones that will come out on top. Specifically, he says the only losers will be antiquated technology and fiat credit. Lastly, he tweets that the most certain time for Bitcoin is when tomorrow is uncertain.

2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00		['Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht Finma']	"The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA has approved the first crypto fund according to Swiss law. The fund, which is restricted to qualified investors, invests primarily in so-called cryptoassets.

For the first time, FINMA has approved a Swiss fund that invests primarily in cryptoassets, that is to say in assets based on the blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The fund concerned goes by the name of the “Crypto Market Index Fund”, an investment fund according to Swiss law belonging to the category ""other funds for alternative investments"" with particular risks. Distribution of this fund is restricted to qualified investors.

Consideration of the particular risks

In order to facilitate serious innovation, FINMA applies the existing provisions of financial market laws in a consistently technology-neutral way, i.e. in keeping with the “same risks, same rules” principle. In doing so, it makes sure that new technologies are not being used to circumvent the existing rules and that the protective goals of financial market legislation are preserved. Since cryptoassets involve particular risks, FINMA also tied the approval to specific requirements in the present case. For instance, the fund may only invest in established cryptoassets with a sufficiently large trading volume. Furthermore, the investments must be made through established counterparties and platforms that are based in a member country of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and are subject to corresponding anti-money laundering regulations. Finally, there are specific requirements with regard to risk management and reporting for the institutions involved in the management and custody.

2021-09-28 11:05:29+00:00	Europe becomes the world’s largest crypto market as UK adoption surges	['Lily Russell-Jones']	"Europe becomes the world’s largest crypto market as UK adoption surges

Europe has become the world’s largest crypto market for the first time (Photo illustration by Edward Smith/Getty Images)

EUROPE has been crowned the world’s largest crypto market with investment in decentralised finance (DeFi) driving a surge in transaction volumes.

European countries received more than $1tn (£734.4bn) worth of cryptocurrency in the space of a year, which represents 25 per cent of global activity, according to a new study by Chainalysis.

The UK was the leading European country for crypto activity between June 2020 and July 2021, with $170bn worth of digital assets received.

Kim Grauer, the Director of Research at Chainalysis dubbed the UK an emerging “global professional cryptocurrency hub”.

“The region in general – Central, Northern, & Western Europe – has the biggest cryptocurrency economy of any region that we study, surpassing East Asia following China’s regulatory crackdowns earlier this year,” Grauer said.

Surging crypto trade volumes are being driven by interest in DeFi, crypto projects and applications which offer decentralised versions of the financial services traditionally offered by banks.

Share of crypto market transaction volume by region (credit: Chainalysis)

Analysis of 34 European countries showed that, in each of the nations, investment in Ether and wrapped Ether – tokens used to access a vast ecosystem of DeFi projects – attracted more capital than any other market segment.

DeFi accounted for the majority of capital invested by large institutional, retail and professional investors across the continent. Gauer confirmed that the UK’s breakaway crypto transaction volumes were “in large part driven by DeFi activity among large, institutional traders”.

In the UK, the flagship cryptocurrency – Bitcoin – accounted for 28 per cent of crypto transactions while the challenger currency Ethereum made up around 40 per cent. DeFi projects accounted for the majority of UK crypto activity with 49 per cent of revenues arising from DeFi protocols.

The comments chime with data showing that DeFi adoption is highest amongst institutional investors and professional traders who have the funds to experiment with riskier projects.

The Chainalysis report found that large institutional cryptocurrency transaction value helped to drive the growth of the European market, jumping from $1.4bn in July 2020 to $46.3bn in June 2021 as banks and financial institutions increased their crypto exposure.

It comes as data released yesterday revealed that more than six in ten institutional investors and wealth managers from the US, UK, France, Germany, and the UAE currently don’t have any exposure to cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and expect to invest for the first time within the next year.

2021-09-27 00:00:00+00:00	Global Cryptocurrency Market (2021 to 2026) - Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecasts	['Research']	"Dublin, Sept. 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Cryptocurrency Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2021-2026"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global cryptocurrency market reached a value of US$ 364.5 Billion in 2020. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 60.8% during 2021-2026. Keeping in mind the uncertainties of COVID-19, the analyst is continuously tracking and evaluating the direct as well as the indirect influence of the pandemic. These insights are included in the report as a major market contributor.



Cryptocurrency refers to digital or virtual money secured by cryptography to monitor transactions and prevent counterfeit. It does not have a physical representation and is distributed over a vast network of computers connected to a virtual environment. It operates through decentralized networks that are based on the blockchain technology. The transfers are secured through public or private keys and are connected directly to the user's digital wallet. In contrast to the traditionally used currency, it is not issued by a centralized authority and has minimal interference or manipulation from the government. It also offers various advantages, such as enhanced portability, divisibility, inflation resistance and transparency.



Increasing digitization across industries represents one of the key factors driving the growth of the market. In line with this, easy accessibility to and rising penetration of high-speed internet connectivity in daily activities is also creating a positive outlook for the market. Furthermore, legalization and approval of purchase, sale or trade of virtual currencies in various developed countries are also driving the market growth. With the immense transparency of distributed ledger technology or blockchain, there is minimal risk of fraudulent or unwanted transactions due to human or machine error or data manipulation. This enables all the parties to monitor any changes that are being made during the transaction in real-time, thereby offering enhanced data security and immutability of the transactions. Additionally, convenient access to online trading platforms that can be used through smartphones is contributing to the market growth. Other factors, including growing market capitalization or market cap of the industry, along with the advent of bitcoin cash and bitcoin lite, are anticipated to drive the market further.

Bitcoin has suffered a massive price crash amid difficulties with El Salvador’s rollout of a new law making the cryptocurrency legal tender.

The price fell from above $52,500 to below $44,000 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.

It has since recovered slightly and is trading back above $46,000, at the time of writing.

Several other leading cryptocurrencies also suffered heavy losses, including ethereum (ether), cardano (ada) and binance coin.

“Horrible chart damage being done in BTC and the rest of the crypto market, tweeted crypto analyst and author Glen Goodman.

“Bitcoin just bounced cleanly off the previous resistance line. Is this a retest of that line or the start of something much worse?”

(CoinMarketCap)

The price correction has wiped hundreds of billions from the overall market, which was worth more than $2.35 trillion at the start of the day.

Leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase experienced issues as people rushed to their portfolios to either cash out or buy the dip.

The company said it was “aware transactions are currently delayed or cancelled at elevated rates and our apps may be experiencing errors”."
2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00	Stocks and futures rebound, crypto flat as the markets head for a down week	[]	"This is the web version of Bull Sheet, a no-nonsense daily newsletter on what’s happening in the markets. Sign up to get it delivered free to your inbox.

Happy Friday, everyone.

Taper with no tantrum. That’s what we’re getting a glimpse of this morning after the European Central Bank yesterday beat the Fed in the race to cut back on stimulus spending, and—what’s this?—stocks are jumping.

To be fair, you’d need to get out the really strong bifocals to spot where exactly the Europeans are cutting back on asset purchases. And, Christine Lagarde herself told the markets, “The lady’s not tapering.” There’s a Maragaret Thatcher reference somewhere in that comment. Perhaps fans of “The Crown” spotted it before I did.

To recap: Asian and European stocks are gaining this morning, as are U.S. futures. Crypto is flat.

Let’s see what else is moving markets as we close out the trading week.

Asia

Asia is bouncing back, with the Hang Seng up 1.6% in afternoon trading as tech stocks gain.

Europe

On Thursday, European stocks rebounded after the ECB said it would—surprise!—begin to slow down its bond-buying spree by year-end, but only by a smidge. Sovereign bond yields and bank stocks jumped on the news. But don’t celebrate, bond fans. Inflation is expected to rise in the near-term.

U.S.

U.S. futures are bouncing back this morning. Even still, it’s a near certainty the three major averages will finish the week in the red.

By the numbers

52.57

September is living up to its reputation as a tough month for stocks. The S&P 500 is on a four-day losing streak, its longest slide in over a month. That sell-off puts the benchmark in negative territory for September. Concerns over tapering, valuations, global growth and rising Delta numbers are weighing on investors. That’s the bad news. The less-bad news? The S&P is a mere 1.2%—or, 52.57 points—off its all-time high. If you’re looking for catalysts, please note: the start of Q3 earnings season is a good month away. In the meantime, there’s not a heck of a lot on the calendar to excite investors. As such, expect them to obsess over Delta numbers.

8 out of 10

As I say above, we’re about 1% off the S&P record close of 4545.85, which happened last week. That’s important to keep in mind amid this week’s lackluster performance. Just as the August rally was more a melt-up than a 🚀, the September swoon seems like a drip-drip-drip decline. But should this sell-off continue, don’t be surprised if you start to hear the R-word—recession—uttered. As Brad McMillan, CIO for Commonwealth Financial Network, noted yesterday, “recessions are strongly associated with market drawdowns. In fact, 8 of 10 bear markets have occurred during recessions.” He points out that the last one happened in February, citing National Bureau of Economic Research data. That recession was super-brief. It also occurred during one of the worst market sell-offs of 2021. As such, Commonwealth Financial Network has a “yellow light” rating on the U.S. economy at the moment.

Zero

We covered yesterday the bearish call by BofA’s Savita Subramanian. A reminder: BofA now has a 4,250 year-end handle on the S&P, which is roughly 5% below yesterday’s close. She doubled down on that outlook yesterday, telling Bloomberg TV, “The S&P 500 has essentially turned into a 36-year, zero-coupon bond… If you look at the duration of the market today, it’s basically longer duration than it’s ever been. This is what scares me.” She went on to say that any normal shock—inflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rates going up; take your pick—will make the market reaction more volatile than ever. She’s not alone in ringing the alarm. Deutsche Bank, too, is warning of a “hard” equity valuation correction.

Have a good weekend. But first, there’s more news below.

2021-09-22 00:00:00+00:00	This Under-the-Radar Altcoin Is Up 34% This Week Despite the Crypto Market Correction	[]	"As the overall cryptocurrency market moves through a turbulent week, one under-the-radar altcoin is defying the downtrend in a major way.

Decentralized reserve currency protocol Olympus (OHM) has surged by 34% over the past seven days.

A possible catalyst for the price jump is the recent announcement of a new product called Olympus Pro.

While discussing hurdles the blockchain industry traditionally faces acquiring funding and its environmental impact, the team behind the project explains,

“Bonds are a mechanism by which the protocol itself can trade its native token in exchange for assets. Instead of renting liquidity from third parties, it purchases them outright.

Once the bond is created, the protocol owns those assets and, like liquidity mining, has distributed new supply.”

Olympus claims to have raised over $150 million in assets since launching the bonds program six months ago.

The new Olympus Pro X bond marketplace seeks to reduce emissions while helping all players within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

In 11 days we made $10m $DAI through bonds. OlympusDAO Treasury now holds $40m $DAI pic.twitter.com/FiSsA4GFuw — OlympusDAO (@OlympusDAO) September 22, 2021

According to the company’s community manager WartuII,

“OlympusDAO 7-day protocol revenue exceeded the combined revenue of OpenSea, dYdX and PancakeSwap.”

OHM is valued at $625.86 at time of writing, a 34% increase from $465.77 a week ago, according to CoinGecko.

Olympus has also attracted the attention of high-profile investor Mark Cuban.

Over the summer, Cuban invested in Olympus, and as of today has 338 staked tokens (SOHM) with a value of $214,327, according to the portfolio tracker Zerion.

Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd (HKG: 03333) is under a massive debt crisis. Debt-laden property developer Evergrande has put global markets on a high alert as all markets are interconnected. However, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday confirmed that Europe had restricted direct exposure to the debt trouble that the Chinese company is reeling under at present.

European Central Bank is monitoring developments as they unfold

In conversation with CNBC’s Annette Weisbach in Frankfurt, Germany, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday said:

Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.

“We are looking at it. We are monitoring and I had a briefing earlier on today because I think that all financial markets are interconnected. I have very vivid memories of [the] latest stock market developments in China that had a bearing across the world. But in Europe and in the euro area, in particular, direct exposure would be limited.”

When questioned if the ECB was ready for the anticipated global impact that could occur due to the collapse of Evergrande, Lagarde stated that she could not speak for the U.S. and added that the direct exposure Europe has is limited.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that Evergrande’s debt problems are to do with China. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Powell informed that he does not witness a parallel with the U.S. corporate sector.

Shares of Evergrande in Hong Kong fell around 7% on Friday

Local officials are cautioned to brace for the potential demise of Evergrande, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Meanwhile, shares of Evergrande in the Hong Kong market plunged around 7% on Friday.

We discussed the next “big thing” and how to get our hands on it before the big name, big chains take hold. We bring up the dreaded ‘C’ word and ask how the coronavirus opened up opportunities and the waves that have come as a result of the year behind closed doors.

In the fast-paced, technological world we live in, there is always something new, something trending and the next “big thing” happening; we are constantly chasing what is considered cool in society, to keep up with our community’s wants and needs, making it important to “live in the future” to keep up with the evolving trends.

“The large companies fail to see the trends” Colin C. Campbell

The NFT market is exploding!

The new digital world is creating more and more opportunities for anyone to jump into business and have a go at being a startup. The NFT is a lot more flexible than ever and it’s an exciting new world to create, develop and follow trends.

The NFT market is the best place for startups because, usually, the big name, big chain companies fail to see the trends.

Change in laws

Isn’t it amazing when trends open up because of a change in the law? It’s a smart way to jump on the ship before everyone else does. “Part of that is a change in human behavior,” said Jeff. Consumers are now wanting to do more and at a faster speed. The human attention span is diminishing but this is ideal for any company chasing trends.

The virtual world

Covid-19 became the year of working online and the WFH lifestyle, but what did this do for startup companies and trends?

You can be as productive from your virtual spaces! You can work from anywhere!

Cut the commute, cut the awkward office from 9 to 5, and create a better work-life balance.

We can communicate more efficiently; we’ve all become comfortable with Zoom and other audio and video-based apps. We are becoming more involved with AI and its advances.

We started off with Alexa and Siri, but now, AI is finding its way into all areas of business and human life, getting better and smarter, and it’s not stopping any time soon!

Health & AI

There is a potential trend in AI and healthcare, a massive industry that could change the future of the health industry.

As we’ve learnt and experienced with Covid-19, there is a need to keep up with diseases and healthcare treatments, and predicting diseases has never been more important. The topic of health will always be a huge market and a market that will always stay trending because human health is of the utmost importance and a number one priority to not only consumers but to all humankind.

Better energy

Solar, renewable energies, and electric cars are being pushed by government funding, it is a huge industry and a great wave to ride right now!

Laura Shin:

Today’s guest is Fereshteh Forough, founder and CEO of Code to Inspire, a coding school for girls in Afghanistan. Welcome, Ferestheh.

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah. Thank you so much, Laura, for having me.

Laura Shin:

So regular listeners to the show will remember that Fereshteh was mentioned in an interview I did with Steve Erlich of Forbes. People were interested in hearing more about her and more about real-world use cases for crypto. So Fereshteh, thank you so much for joining us, especially because world news in recent months has had a direct impact on you and your family. But before we get into those recent events, why don’t we start with your personal story as a refugee and how you became a computer science professor?

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. I was born as a refugee in Iran during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. My parents are originally from Herat, it’s a city in the west of Afghanistan, very mountainous and beautiful. It’s one of the main cities that the heart of the ancient silk road was passing through the city. So, unfortunately, my parents, the same as a lot of other people in Afghanistan had to leave the country and find a safe haven for their children. I was born in a very small town close to Iran and Afghanistan border. I grew up in a big family, eight children. I’m the fifth one. So you can imagine, I’m not the oldest and I’m not the youngest. So I kind of grew up independent and I think that’s really shaped my character. Certainly being born as a refugee, growing up as a refugee, there are a lot of issues you are facing. Not only the discriminations that you’re facing with because you’re just different. And unfortunately, sometimes people look at you as an unwanted guest and they think that you’re here to steal the opportunities from them. That makes it very difficult for you to blend into the community. Then the financial aspects of it. Being a refugee, you will be denied access to certain basic and fundamental rights in the country that you’re in, such as opening bank accounts or accessing education in the school. And that was one of the big issues that we were facing with my family. And I remember that my mom learned how to stitch and make dresses. By selling them, she could bring money to the family and she could invest in our education.

So I guess from a very early age, I learned to be an entrepreneur and how you can start great things with empty hands. And that’s what I learned from my mom. I know the value of education and how it is important. We moved to Afghanistan one year after the fall of the Taliban — when the US invaded Afghanistan in 2002 to Herat and I applied for university entrance and by chance, and randomly, I got into computer science. That was certainly not my favorite field of study. And my family really encouraged me to continue because they said it’s the future. It’s something that we think can help you a lot. And I continued studying computer science. I got my bachelor’s from Herat University, and then I received a scholarship. I went to Germany and I got my master’s in computer science from the Technical University of Berlin. Went back and taught as a computer science professor for about three years at Herat University.

So certainly I guess my life story as a refugee being denied accessing education, and as a woman studying computer science, and teaching computer science in Herat and Afghanistan, the discrimination, the backlashes I faced, the verbal and sexual harassment in the working and educational space. It made me think about how I can change the situation for women, especially in the technology sector. And that’s how it led me to establish Code to Inspire aspire as the first coding school for girls in Afghanistan, January 2015.

Laura Shin:

And tell us what Code to Inspire does.

Fereshteh Forough:

With Code to Inspire, there are three important pillars of the work. First, we provide a single-gender school, only for women and girls, so that the family feels comfortable sending their daughters to our school. Second, we offer a school for free because a lot of the girls come from a challenging financial background.

And the third, which is the most important pillar of the work, is we offer certain technical skills that can be translated either into job opportunities within the community in Afghanistan, or we can outsource projects to them. So the students can work remotely, or they can be entrepreneurs and create their own company and startups and hire more women. Since 2015, we’ve educated more than 350 students in our coding classes, such as game design, web development, mobile, and also a blockchain cryptocurrency and graphic design class. With our graduates, the data that we have, well pre-Taliban, unfortunately, since a month ago, 70% of our students found jobs within the community and they’re getting paid some of the above-average income salary, which is $150 per month in Afghanistan. We outsourced more than 40 projects worth more than $30,000 to our students. A group of our graduates, about 10% of them, they created their own startups, raised funds and hired more women. And our school gained pre-Taliban was a physical location in Herat, with full time for our students and the classes were being taught in person.

Laura Shin:

And so give us a sense of kind of what girls education and opportunities are in Afghanistan aside from this school. Like, if they don’t have this kind of opportunity, then what does that look like for them?

Fereshteh Forough:

There are certainly a lot of challenges and issues, not only right now, which is a whole different story with the Taliban taking over Afghanistan, but even in the past — infrastructure is a big issue. If you talk about big cities, still there’s a lack of buildings, staff, and teachers and resources for students, especially female schools. That lack of equipments like having laptops, internet connections, and the commute would be a big issue for the girls to leave their house, especially the ones who live far away from the school. If you leave the big cities, in surrounding areas and especially in villages, you won’t have facility for that. You may have access to primary or maybe secondary education, but you don’t have high school just because, again, the population is financially underserved. There’s not a lot of resources for them, such as schools, buildings. The families won’t feel comfortable sending their daughters to travel a long way to go to the next big city to get the education.

So the lack of resources and infrastructure really is a big issue to access equal education, especially for girls and women. And then beside that, of course, the cultural, the patriarchal society. The extremists make it very difficult for the girls to access education. Sometimes families become under the influence of the extremists and won’t let their daughter to continue education. Forced marriages, early marriages, are one of the important factors that the girl is dropped from school because once they get married, the fiance or the husband, won’t let them to continue education. And of course they gain financial issues. Not a lot of family can invest in extracurricular activities. They prefer to invest on the boys’ education because they think that the boy is going to be the future breadwinner, not the girl. So they prefer to send the boy to the school, not the girl. So these are some of the main important factors of why girls education would be very difficult, not only in cities, but also in areas outside of the city for Afghanistan.

Laura Shin:

Can you maybe give some examples of kind of what risks girls face when they do try to seek out an education?

Fereshteh Forough:

Definitely the backlash and the threats they face from either their family members or the community. A lot of times maybe the male members of the family relatives would be against the education. And if they raise their voice, they make those threats. It can be threats such as like, they hit them — violence against women. They lock them at home. Or the extreme way of like extremist burning the schools for girls. We do have incidents of extremists on the Taliban burning girl’s schools, and that makes the family feel so scared and uncomfortable to risk the lives of the girl’s to send them to school. Even like trying to do the commute from one location to another location, they may be abducted by unknown people. So these are like serious concerns that make it very difficult sometimes for families to, even if they want to send their daughters to school, won’t feel comfortable to do that.

Laura Shin:

Since founding Code to Inspire, what impact have you seen it have?

Fereshteh Forough:

There are a lot of inspiring stories of the girls who came to the school and graduated. I can say a majority of the girls who joined our coding school didn’t have access to internet connections. They didn’t have laptops, even basic phones. So they were totally living in an offline world. And with the infrastructure and equipments, we provided it for them, that was certainly life-changing. Not only looking at the educational aspects of it, but all of the financial aspects of it. These are the girls who came to school, they were so shy. They really didn’t believe in themselves. They didn’t have self-esteem. We encouraged them to build their own life around what they’re learning and be outspoken and raise their voice. No one would question them, and we see that like their self self-esteem boosted, they now have social media accounts and write about their activities.

I’ll give you one example of one of our graduates. She came to the school when she was in 10th grade and then we interviewed her and asked her why she wanted to join this coding school. And she said, I want to make money. And we were like, that’s great. There’s nothing wrong with making money. And she came from a very financial challenging background. She even couldn’t pay for the commute, but she was so motivated that we sponsored her commute, gave her a laptop to take home. And once she graduated, she was one of the top graduates. And one day she texted me and she said, you can’t believe what I say that I convinced the company that they’re all men that I can make a website for you and take your business online. And they agreed and they going to pay me $200. I was like, wow, you’re so bad-ass at such a young age to convince the companies and men to give you an opportunity. And now you are bringing money to the family, which makes you to have a voice in the family and be a part of the decision making process in the family. And we have tons of stories like that.

Laura Shin:

I was going to ask you: do you feel that the experience that the girls have, that it changes attitudes either in their family or in their communities? Or does the existence of the school in general, has that had an impact and changing attitudes?

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. When we have started a program and we were kind of like posting on our social media about our activities, a lot of people, especially men, very educated in computer science, were like, oh, that’s useless what they’re learning. They are gonna get married. They’re going to like go to the house, clean the kitchen, make babies and stuff like that. And it was so offensive because they couldn’t see that there is a path to financial freedom with what we are trying to do. And after a year or so, when we have graduates and we helped them with jobs and giving them opportunities, they brought the money to the family and some of them actually made double or triple than the men in the family. And the family couldn’t believe that the girl of the family is capable of doing something that the boy of the family is not. And they called us, they start calling us the father, the brother, the husbands came to check the school. And they said, we can’t believe. We see that she is behind the computer. She’s doing something, but we have no idea, but she’s bringing money to the family. And they started calling the relatives and other people and encourage their daughter to join in a school. And we received calls from others. So it became very organic, once people realized that there’s a value on investing in education and the gauze being able to bring money to the family.

Laura Shin:

That’s, that’s great. When you were talking earlier, it’s such a contrast if I think about growing up here in the US. There’s no question that you sent a girl to school. What you’re saying is just very eyeopening for somebody who grew up here. But one other thing I found fascinating was I have seen a video about Code to Inspire where the girls were making video games and the protagonist or the player in the game, they made it as an Afghan girl. And then the video showed that there were Afghan boys playing this game. And I just wondered how do you think things like that have also changed perceptions of girls in Afghanistan?

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. So like beside education, we also want to change the perspective of community towards girls’ education and empowerment. And we’ve been creating different games and apps that are geared towards certain problems in the community. And one of them was the Afghan Hero Girl game that you are referring to. I remember we had a brainstorming session with our students in-game class, and we were kind of like, okay, what would be the next game? And then they’re like, they’re kind of tired of seeing all these like superheroes in the game are mainly men. And then they’re just like targeting certain geographical population. There is a very few female superhero and also like from Afghanistan or from a Muslim country.

So then we’re like, okay, what about we create our own superhero? And then they created the app of Afghan Hero Girl, wearing traditional outfit and going through different stages. It was certainly an eye-opening experience for us too. We couldn’t believe that the game would have such a good feedback. I mean, we have a lot of thousands of downloads, hundreds of comments, and they’re all men giving us comments that, oh, what if you put the arrow here or what if you add this function? So like, it’s great to see that they’re engaged. When the little girls were playing that game, they’re all like, oh, I want to be a superhero like Heron. And I want to like I have that power. I think that’s very, very empowering and important in such a young age when they see a role model in a superhero that they can be that person.

Laura Shin:

So at a certain point Code to Inspire began adopting crypto. How did you guys start using it and why?

Fereshteh Forough:

With cryptocurrency, that’s interesting. I got to know about it late 2013, maybe early 2014. And that was again, because of work that I was doing with Afghanistan. Sending payments, and it was certainly a big issue.The bank system requiring a lot of paper works and it takes a lot of time and all the KYC. And of course it’s Afghanistan. So people are kind of like giving you more hard time when you deal with Afghanistan, especially I guess, for financial issues. Western Union also, we tried, but it was very costly with the fees that we were having to pay. And those fees for a lot. $10 to $15 would be covering a family for a couple of days to have food on your table. And then PayPal is not operating in Afghanistan. So that was also like not an option for us.

And a lot of the people who were sending money, the girls, were underage, so they didn’t have a bank account. So these issues were very time consuming. Dealing with a lot of paperwork. And it was frustrating at some point. And that’s how I learned about cryptocurrency and at that time, of course, Bitcoin, and how fascinating is the technology. It’s very fast without any third party and so secure, it can just like send directly money to the girls and they can have it. And since then, I got to know more about the technology itself and then how we can help the girls. And we started sending crypto to Afghanistan. And then with Code to Inspire, particularly, we started teaching blockchain technologies, smart contracts, solidity, decentralized apps to our students.

And actually, as of this week, five of our students are part of the ConsenSys Academy, which is very exciting. So hopefully they will finish the course and it will be a great experience for them. And then with the organization itself, we do accept crypto as a donation since 2015. I can say probably we are one of the very early organization who accepted crypto as a donation, but also keep holding it. So that hopefully down the road we can use it for more powerful and like help more population in Afghanistan. And then also sending. Since January, we used to send on and off, but since this January, we only are sending crypto to Afghanistan for our monthly operation. Also, for the care package cash assistance that we are helping our students who are losing jobs and their family. So it’s amazing. It’s unbelievable how this technology can help in such a critical moment where the banks are closed, the Western Union has limited services, and nothing is working in Afghanistan. We are probably, again, one of the very only organizations and people who are using it in such a larger scale.

Laura Shin:

Wow. So I have so many questions about this. But initially when you started describing how you first began using crypto, was that to make payments to the girls for gigs that they did? Or was it to fund your operations, like accepting donations? What was that initial purpose for using the crypto at that time?

Fereshteh Forough:

A combination of both, but mainly for the girls who were using worked for the remote work and we wanted to like send them quicker to that.

Laura Shin:

Oh, I see. And so then once you received that money, and I’m sure this has changed over time, but how are you turning that into Afghanis, which is the local currency?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah, that’s a great question. It was so difficult at the beginning because. At the beginning to kind of had to like act as an exchange ourselves because no one knew about it. So if you send crypto to the girls and they wanted to cash out, they would come to us and we would give them cash. But then we found a financial district in Herat that people do money exchange exchange. They change Afghanis to dollars to euro and vice versa.

And then since kind of like in November last year, we were like, okay, it’s just too complicated and we’re done with all this like third-party and paperwork and everything is just like too much. And let’s see how we can work it out. And then we start investigating and then we found some people in the financial districts of Herat that they said, yes, we can exchange crypto for you.

And then we started at a small scale, just building trust through the relationship with them and see how it works. And it worked so great for us that now that one person is actually about three or four people. So now there are more people who do that. So what we do, we send crypto from our wallet to our team wallet in Afghanistan. And then they go to the exchange and they convert it to mainly US dollar. And then we distribute the cash among the team to pay for rent utility, and also again recently for the cash assistance for our students.

Laura Shin:

Oh, so they’re actually turning it into US dollars. And then I guess later on the, when they need the money, then they put it into Afghanis or something?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. Then they can go to any money exchange there and convert their dollar to Afghani if they want.

Laura Shin:

And for those individual sellers that you’re trading with, are they associated with any of that kind of you know Craigslist style sellers, like Local Bitcoins or Paxful? Or are they just kind of like independent people that offer this service?

Fereshteh Forough:

They’re independent people that they offer the services.

Laura Shin:

Oh, interesting. Other than Code to Inspire, how popular is crypto in Afghanistan or what other people are using it for?

Fereshteh Forough:

To be honest with you, I think since last winter, crypto got more momentum in Afghanistan and we did have a lot of people who reached out to me, either from colleagues or other non-profits who reached out, and they said, oh, like, we see that, like you do a lot of crypto, can you give us a little bit of like how it works? We’re interested to explore that because again, the financial difficulties we’re facing. And we connect some of them to this money exchange person that we know and trust.

Even recently, a couple of weeks ago, again, because of the humanitarian crisis that’s happening in Afghanistan with everything and the bank closed and the Western Union, more nonprofits are reaching out to me, humanitarian aid is reaching out to me and ask how we are handling it. And I’m kind of like putting them in touch with the people that we know. And hopefully that actually would be a way that it opens the door for cryptocurrency to be adopted more.

Laura Shin:

Huh. This is just so interesting. And so for the community around your school, like the girls and their families, and people just who know generally about Code to Inspire, what would you say that their perception is of cryptocurrency now, because of all this?

Fereshteh Forough:

So first of all, it was very unknown to them. They were like, what is this? I can’t touch it. It’s like over the internet. They were like, is it a scam? Do you want to scam us? People had a lot of different thoughts about this. I hear them because like they used to do this old system of only keeping cash under their pillows. That’s how they kind of like saved their money. So when you go and tell them it’s money over the internet, they’re confused. Especially when they don’t have basic digital literacy, then that would be more difficult to talk to them about this. But then once we started sending to our own team, as an example and how they used it for their own, we could pay for our rent.

And then we start sending the cash assistance to our students. And now the family’s getting it. Now, when people, at the end of the day, they see the cash, they understand what’s the work flow of it. But also like how it is important, the privacy aspect of it, how you can control your money. Because in geographical locations like Afghanistan, it’s always been under conflict, war. The political system changes a lot and each of them come and they have their own agenda. It is really difficult to trust in the centralized system, the banks and the governments, because you don’t know what kind of revelations they bring. And then for example, even right now, a lot of people who left Afghanistan, who got evacuation, majority of them left their bank account behind, and they don’t know if they can access that bank out anytime soon. God knows how much money they had in it, but they had a decent amount of number. to be able to carry your finance with yourself outside of the conflict zone. That’s a very big lesson that a lot of people are learning. And I think crypto will change that and help the people to realize that it’s important to be as much as independent, especially if you’re living in a conflict zone.

Laura Shin:

This is so interesting that you’re seeing all this because I feel like there’s, for the longest time in the crypto industry, there’s been an idealistic notion that crypto will help the unbanked. At least here in the US, it doesn’t seem to have happened to a great extent. So I’m glad to hear that people seem to be benefiting from that in Afghanistan.

I just want to get a sense: do you still feel that it’s not very widespread and it’s just kind of like a small number of people in the know, or do you feel like it’s kind of like something that people are hearing about quickly?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah. It’s not really widespread, but I guess like within the international community and people who are sending aid to Afghanistan, that’s something that they are investigating and are open to explore because they all of a sudden have faced a blockage of like sending aids to Afghanistan. And they also don’t want to send the money to the banks with this situation. So they’re exploring ways that firsthand send the money to the people who are in need. And that’s the only way. So that’s great to see that now the international community and the aids are looking at crypto as a way for how and secure to send funds instead of relying and sending money to the banks and to the governments.

Laura Shin:

All right. So in a moment, we’re going to talk a little bit more about the effect of the withdrawal from Afghanistan of US troops has had there, but first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

Back to my conversation with Fereshteh. So you’ve kind of been alluding to the impact that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has had there. But for now, for all that you described about Code to Inspire, what is the situation now? Is the school functioning, what has happened to the girls and their families, et cetera?

Fereshteh Forough:

Well, the situation on the ground is certainly very devastating. Not only because a humanitarian crisis is happening right now — banks are closed. There is no job economy. It’s falling apart. And you know, a lot of people are dealing with hunger and even they don’t have money to cover basics necessities. And that’s what we are also like dealing with our students and their families who about 80 of them reach out to me, and they said they have even not having a bread at home. And it’s very difficult because the majority of them lost jobs, and especially women. But despite the humanitarian crisis, of course, education, which is a fundamental human right. And everyone should have access to education, no matter of their gender identity or any differences. It’s getting a lot of backlashes in Afghanistan — since the fall of Afghanistan did, sorry.

Since Afghanistan fallen to the Taliban on August 15, I can say that that was the first day that Herat, my city, after two weeks of resistance, was captured by the Taliban. And for me watching the videos of Taliban walking through the city was very heartbreaking, tragic. I remember that day. And for the next couple of days, I cried a lot because I couldn’t believe that just things are on unfolding so quickly like that. And all the work that we’ve on and everyone else has done this past 20 years may be taken from us. And then unfortunately within one week, so quickly, the entire Afghanistan has got into all the influence of Taliban. And when people say Taliban 2.0, they changed, I don’t think they changed, because if they’ve been changed, the situation right now wouldn’t be devastating, right?

First of all, we closed the school because we didn’t want to. We closed the school before, even two weeks before, when the attacks happened around the city, because of the safety of our students. The school is still closed because we don’t know what going to happen if we open the school in person, even though we are a single gender school. The Taliban shouldn’t have an issue with that.

Regarding the education. The Taliban allow the girls to go to school only from first to sixth grade. And then four days ago, they announced the first day back to school and with their announcement, they only said the boys can go to school from first to 12th grade. So they let the boys from seventh grade to 12th grade and other private institutes, religious school go to school.

But not women. No girls from 7th to 12th grade are allowed to go to school still as of now. And also the universities, they had conversation with the board of universities, but they only had conversation with the male board and the professors and not women. And they kind of like make an excuse that they say, oh, we’re thinking about separation of the classes, but the high school of the girls in Afghanistan are already separated. You know, the schools are separated, the building is separated. So why they don’t let the girls go to school? Well, university, yes, there used to be mixed classes, but not the high school. And that’s why you can’t trust them because they’re not clear and they are, of course, preventing girls go to school.

And the same as the university and also work. We had like students who used to work in offices that they used to work and now they’re not going there because they’re not allowed to go. And they don’t know if they can return to the offices and work. So it is a strain that all these millions of girls who had hopes, who had dreams, and every day they go to school. Now they’re home and they don’t know what’s going to happen to them. And their future is not clear.

Laura Shin:

I saw you tweeted that girls there are texting you messages like I am afraid for my life, I haven’t eaten these past days, and slept in different houses overnights for my safety. And I wondered, so this was from a few weeks ago, and I wondered, has that changed at all? Is the comfort level a little bit higher now? Or are the girls still living in a state of fear?

Fereshteh Forough:

Not really. Definitely the girls are still living in a state of fear and trauma. I still received messages from girls that they’re like, I lost hope. I wanted to do this and that, but I don’t think… if there would be a possibility for me to have education outside of Afghanistan, will you help me? So I received a lot of emails and texts, not only from our students, but from people that I haven’t met and they asked for help. And it’s so heartbreaking to see that a functioning government. And I don’t all deny that there was corruption in the previous government. There were still people who were against women’s education, work, and employment. It wasn’t a perfect government, but at least it was functioning. My school was open, and I could help the girls to get an education and a lot of girls around Afghanistan could go to school. But with this government, it seems everything is closed only for women.

And they just like totally ignoring half of the community and the society. The girls are going through a lot of trauma. I mean, like we weren’t able even to continue any of our classes virtually because they just can’t concentrate. Some of them left the city with their family. They are in other cities. Some of them left the country. Some of them their house got shot by the Taliban or because of the explosion, the house got destructed. So just, I can’t imagine you’re dealing with all that, you still have the motivation to continue and will have hope for your future.

Laura Shin:

And so are you just kind of in an indefinite holding pattern with Code to Inspire? Or is there any sign that would kind of make you feel comfortable opening it again? And, also, when you talked about how you can’t do virtual classes, I didn’t know how widespread the internet would be in homes. I didn’t know, is this something where they could kind of take these classes in their own homes or do the coding work in their own homes?

Fereshteh Forough:

There’s two possibilities here, right? I mean, maybe I would be able to keep the school open under certain rules and circumstances. And, sure, why not? Because that space was the safest space for the girls and they had access to a lot of resources. And if that space can be open and of course they would be safe. Why not? I’ll keep the school open, and that will be great. But for whatever reason, if we wouldn’t be able to keep the school open, of course, virtual is what we’re going to pursue and do that. But within the next month or so we hopefully have a better understanding of what’s the agenda and how we can move forward. But absolutely I will continue my work ritual. I make sure the girl has a laptop and an internet connection at home. We put all the content we have online and we help them to continue to classes the same as before, but virtual, in a safe space at their home, and then help them to find jobs remotely, which right now we still have about like three clients that about eight of our students are still working and do their projects online, which kept them hopeful. And I think that’s one thing, then we will continue no matter what.

Laura Shin:

Yeah, I did see that back in 2018, Code to Inspire, did start a partnership with Bounties Network to allow girls to collect bounties in ETH for fixing vulnerabilities in code. Is that something you’re still doing. If not, like, are there other ways that the crypto community or that blockchain technology generally can help in this situation?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah, that was actually a very exciting project that we worked with. We had, some of our students get engaged to some small projects. It was great. Right now we are not that much involved, but it was certainly a great eye-opening experience where I was students to work in such platforms and then get to know about crypto.

And as of now, yes, I mean, we are trying to find people who want to help us with their skill and expertise, and if they can help us to create a very strong, private, secure, online platform, educational for our students, and then people who have experienced teaching coding and help us with different sets of programming languages, to create videos so we can share with our students or want to be a mentor and help our students with their codings. With the companies, definitely if they want to offer internships for our students, part-time, full-time projects and work. I mean, these are the opportunities that we would be able, by giving a laptop, and buying internet package for our students, helped them to get motivated and continue what they do from the safety of their house.

Laura Shin:

And there was also been a lot of talk and, and work, on things like decentralized identity solutions or decentralized mesh networks for offering internet. Is that something that would be helpful in this situation at all?

Fereshteh Forough:

To be honest with you, I don’t know what would be the Taliban agenda regarding the internet censorship. I don’t know if they are going to censor or are they going to track people or what would be their agenda on that. Because, for example, before their attack to Herat city, they actually bombed an internet tower and an electricity tower. And that actually was a huge damage to the entire Western region. The whole city in the Western region were all offline for a couple of weeks. Of course, with the work we do and if it should be virtual, then that would be a big issue. So I think it’s just like, again, depends on like how they interact with the infrastructure, if they’re going to bring any damage, any censorship, tracking people. And these are like the factors and variables that we really want to take into consideration and make it as private, encrypted, and safe for the girls even to have an online identity.

Laura Shin:

Okay. But so far it sounds like the financial part of crypto is what has been most useful for your school.

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes.

Laura Shin:

In that regard, one question I had is, I’m assuming and correct me if I’m wrong, that perhaps the cryptocurrencies that most people donate are bitcoin and ether and they’re also the most liquid. But at the moment, or really for kind of a while now, they’ve both been experiencing somewhat high fees on the base layer chain. Does that affect you at all? Like I noticed today, the date we’re recording, the average transaction fee on bitcoin is about $2.50 cents. And for ether today, it’s like a little under $4, but a few days ago is highest $7. So I didn’t know if that has affected you at all, or if it’s not something that if it’s something that the sellers don’t really count.

Fereshteh Forough:

We really haven’t faced issues with that. And again, with the person who exchange crypto for us, they don’t charge us like a crazy amount. We want to make them happy and keep them happy to do business with us. So we pay a very small fee to them. But so far now we haven’t been much influenced by that. And again, the fact that we are using this technology, in this situation, it was like the best tool that’s just enabled us and helped us. So we are very happy with the way that we are managing our finance and sending money to Afghanistan.

Laura Shin:

So from your perspective as somebody who does use crypto a lot in a very crucial way, are there any kind of like requests you would make to developers in the industry for tools? Or for certain types of technology that you feel would be useful? Or just anything you feel that entrepreneurs in the space could think about?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. I still think that, as you said, when we talk about crypto and we say the notion of it was to help the unbanked and under served communities, I think is still probably a lot of the solutions that come out. It’s for more privileged people who do have access to banks, who do have credit cards, or some sort of financial freedom and living in a more relaxed community. So any solutions, especially for people who live in constant conflict and war and displacement — either to keep their identity private, to keep their documents private, and that can carry with themselves any part of the world. I think that’s something that’s very important. How you can keep your documents somewhere very private that you can access, but also like you can use it because down the road, when you’re a refugee, you leave everything behind. Even carrying certain documents would be very dangerous for you because then they can identify who you are. And that would be a big issue. So that’s something if there are solutions around, would be helpful.

And also in case of finance. Solutions, if exchanges or any apps or any solution, that can help people not only rely on the local exchange, but like create a more faster and easier way for them to access the crypto market, will also would be able to cash it out. I mean, right now, if you want to create accounts on different exchanges to KYC, which is understandable, but it would be very difficult for a lot of people in Afghanistan, just because a lot of them don’t have proper documents on identification. And that’s one step that won’t let them to even create an account, let alone to use that exchange in everything.

Laura Shin:

Yeah. Well, that’s what I was talking about when I was mentioning blockchain based identities. I don’t know of any that are kind of in widespread use. Is that something that you’ve looked into at all?

Fereshteh Forough:

No, to be honest with you, I don’t have any knowledge around it.

Laura Shin:

I don’t feel like I’ve heard kind of a lot of concrete work in that area. That is something that I think could address these issues that you’re discussing. So as we’ve been discussing throughout this interview, there’s clearly a lot of sexism and discrimination that you have faced in Afghanistan as a woman. But this is an issue in a lot of parts in the world and here in the US, and just in general, you could say in the western world, like Europe and the US, there aren’t as many women in crypto or involved in blockchain technology as there are men. And I just wondered from your experience as a woman in tech, in Afghanistan, do you have any advice for bringing more women into crypto? Or advice to women in the field who feel that they’re facing sexism and discrimination?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. It’s an interesting question because I can say I have a thick skin now and don’t get bothered. I went through a lot. Generally speaking, I’m a risk-taker person. I’m not really bothered by all these issues.

But what I think from being different, just a refugee hiding my true identity in Iran as a refugee and then a woman in technology and Afghanistan being very outspoken, social, which cost me a lot. I think being indifferent, even as like a woman in a group that they’re all men, it’s beautiful because you bring a different perspective to everyone else’s perspective who is similar. So you have actually way stronger voice than the rest of the group.

You think you are outnumbered, but actually, your voice is stronger because it’s your opinion and the value you bring to the table is much more different and might be things that they’ve never imagined. So I think even if you walk in a room — it doesn’t matter if it’s like a tech meeting, crypto space, any space, that you walk in and you are one of the very few women, or the only woman, you should be so proud that you are in that group, because those people actually give an opportunity to see a different perspective. So for me, I think you have to just go for it. And those single number of women in those meetings are actually opening the doors for other women to walk in. So it is an opportunity for us to take it and change the environment. And of course it’s not an easy path. I’m sure a lot of women face a lot of sexism, terrible sexual harassment, and any other backlashes. But I think it’s that I can be the one who can open the door for the rest. Then sure, I’ll take it. And I’ll like lead that path.

Laura Shin:

Earlier in the episode, you said that you had a lot of inspiring stories like that one that you told about the girl. And I wondered if you wanted to share one more.

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. We had one other student that she was working with a client here and working on the graphic design. And she was also coming from a challenging financial background, but she was a brilliant student, very great graphic designer. I really liked her work and we picked her for doing the work for them. And she worked so well that the client were like, oh my God, you are so happy with her. And they used to pay her like $10 per hour. And then they said, now you’re going to pay you $30 per hour. And with that money, she used to use the laptop that we were given her to do the work because she didn’t have a laptop. She not only makes a lot of good money that she bought a laptop for herself, but also like paid for the education for the brothers and also helped the family. And that was like when she had texted to me and she said, I couldn’t believe the day when I walk into this school, I could make this money and I can buy a laptop for myself and now do the work and help my family. It’s just like unreal. And like, that was the whole world to me to see that like her life changed like that.

Laura Shin:

That’s so great. I love it. So for listeners who were interested in helping Code to Inspire what can they do? Where can they go?

Fereshteh Forough:

Well, we are a non-profit registered. So we are a tax-deductible organization, both for you know, fiat currency and cryptocurrency. So if they’re interested to support us, sponsor students, especially with the cash assistance that we’re dealing with now or purchasing equipment, they can check out website codetoinspire.org and they can donate to our cause. Besides that, we are looking for people who are interested in what we do right now and care about the future of African girls and their education. We would like to have their expertise, as I said, in the case of building a virtual system. If they’ve been teaching, coding, used their materials and curriculum. If they are looking to hire our graduates and students, we are happy to have a conversation. So many possibilities, any opportunities that they think, would certainly change lives and would be really appreciated. So we are very open to have conversations with them.

Laura Shin:

Great. And where can people learn more about you, such as like a Twitter handle?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. my Twitter account is @f_forough. That’s my Twitter handle.

Laura Shin:

Well, thank you so much for coming on Unchained.

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. Thanks for having me. I appreciate that you gave your platform in such a difficult time for Afghanistan to shed some light and just raise more awareness in this about what’s the current situation in the future for women above mechanist.

Laura Shin:

Yeah. And I really wish you and all your students, the best of luck navigating this time. And I really hope everything works out the best for all of you.

Laura Shin:

Thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about Fereshteh and Code to Inspire, check out the show notes for this episode. Unchained is produced by me, Laura Shin, without from Anthony Yoon, Daniel Nuss and Mark Murdock. Thanks for listening."
2021-09-24 00:00:00+00:00	Column: How you pay for electricity is changing. Here’s what you need to know	['David Lazarus Is A Former Business Columnist For The Los Angeles Times Who Focused On Consumer Affairs. He Appears Daily On Ktla-Tv Channel His Award-Winning Work Has Appeared In Newspapers Across The Country', 'Resulted In A Variety Of Laws Protecting Consumers.']	"More than 2 million Southern California Edison residential customers are about to be switched to new rate plans.

Approximately half this number will see their monthly bills go down, the utility says. A million or so may see their bills rise by a few bucks.



For the record: An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that Edison customers cannot change back to their previous rate plan after the first year. They can make once-a-year changes.

And roughly 100,000 Edison customers could see their electricity bills climb by hundreds of dollars a year unless they opt out or significantly change their behavior.

Californians are now facing one of the most sweeping changes to how they pay for energy. Ensuring ratepayers are well-informed about the stakes — and the decisions they have to make — is crucial. Edison could be doing a better job.

A spokesperson for the utility challenged that characterization. We’ll get back to that.

Advertisement

I learned about the Edison rate change from a Palm Springs resident named Lynn Pettit, who sent me a copy of the letter she received from the utility informing her about the transition, which in her case takes effect in December.

“Is it a scam?” she asked.

“I thought at first that the letter seemed reasonable,” Pettit, 85, told me. “Then I read the rest of it and I thought, ‘What?'""

OK, this next bit is a little wonky, so hang in there.

It won’t come as a news flash to anyone that California’s power grid is straining to keep up with demand as climate change affects electricity usage, especially during increasingly sizzling summers.

Crazy-hot temps mean millions of air conditioners running simultaneously. Blackouts are a perennial possibility.

To help fix this, the California Public Utilities Commission ordered Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric to switch most customers to so-called time-of-use rate plans.

The idea is to offer lower rates to people during off-peak hours. Basically, demand is highest between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m., when solar power is less plentiful and energy can cost about 60% more on summer weekdays.

Time-of-use plans allow most ratepayers to save money if they concentrate their energy use — running the washing machine, say — outside that time frame.

Edison has already moved about a million residential customers and most business customers to time-of-use plans. It’s now notifying 2.3 million more residential customers that it’s their turn, with rate changes occurring in waves from November to next April.

Let’s stipulate right here that time-of-use rate plans are a good idea. They incentivize consumers to ease the burden on the power grid, make more use of alternative energy sources and generally be nicer to Mother Nature.

But if the letter received by Pettit is any indication, Edison could be doing a better job selling the concept.

“Time-of-use plans encourage people to use energy at the times of day when renewable energy, like solar and wind, is the most abundant and at the lowest cost,” it says.

“With small changes in your energy habits, you can save money and help our state meet its clean energy goals.”

Then comes the first curve ball. The letter says Pettit and other Edison customers will be moved automatically to time-of-use plans unless they opt out.

Let’s be real clear about this: Opt-outs are almost always a red flag for consumers. They typically signal that something is good for companies but bad for customers.

The sharing of your personal information, for instance. If you don’t want a company doing that, you have to opt out (and even then, businesses will still do it on a limited basis).

Companies are well aware that relatively few consumers will make the effort to opt out of things, which is why important decisions are routinely presented as opt-outs rather than opt-ins. Call it corporate coercion.

By the same token, though, many if not most consumers won’t opt in to things that they didn’t initiate. They’ll ignore the offer.

This is a Catch-22 of modern life. Opt-outs are often unfair. Opt-ins are frequently ineffective.

Edison’s letter to Pettit makes clear that the change to her rate plan is not in her favor. It states that, under her current plan, she pays about $4,467 a year for power.

Under the pending time-of-use plan, it says, she’ll pay $4,705 a year — a more than 5% rate hike.

The letter says that for the first 12 months after the switch, she’ll receive a one-time credit from Edison if her time-of-use bills exceed her current payments. It says she can switch back to her current plan during the first year. Once-a-year changes are also possible after this time.

“I wonder how many people won’t read the letter, or won’t check their bills on a regular basis,” Pettit told me. “The only reasonable way to do this is to ask people to opt in.”

Normally I’d agree with that. But in this case, the stakes are exceedingly high, and it’s crucial that as many Californians as possible participate in the new rate plan.

Ron Gales, an Edison spokesperson, said the Southern California utility and Northern California’s PG&E originally favored the idea of opt-ins when statewide plans for the switch to time-of-use rates started taking shape about a decade ago.

California regulators, however, saw that Sacramento’s community-owned utility had better luck with opt-outs, so the edict was handed down: Opt-outs for all.

From Edison’s perspective, this was the right move.

Gales told me that when the utility tested opt-ins with some customers, only about 5% agreed to switch to the new plan. That’s 95% who either didn’t want to change or couldn’t be bothered to even think about it.

“We’re trying to alter the behavior of millions of people,” Gales observed. “How do you do that if hardly anyone opts in?”

San Diego’s utility finished moving eligible residential customers to time-of-use rates in May 2020. According to the PUC, 98% of the total remained on the new plan.

Gales said most Edison customers will see lower bills as a result of moving to time-of-use plans and making modest changes to their energy use.

But he acknowledged that for about 100,000 “extreme non-benefitters” such as Pettit, average monthly bills could rise by as much as 10% from current levels.

“We recognize that,” he told me. “We’ll be following up with such people by phone.”

I pointed out that amid a proliferation of scam calls, many people no longer pick up the phone. “That’s a valid point,” Gales acknowledged — another quirk of modern life.

Where Edison dropped the ball, I think, is in making the case to the tens of thousands of people like Pettit who will look at their letters and conclude they’re being hit with a hefty rate increase.

Gales explained that the estimates for current payments versus time-of-use payments don’t factor in behavioral changes a customer might make.

That is, Pettit and others could still see their bills go down if they adjust their energy use to avoid peak hours.

Edison could have done a better job communicating this.

What it should have done is provide not two but three data points — estimated current bills, estimated time-of-use bills and estimated time-of-use bills with new behavior factored in.

Gales said Edison’s honchos considered estimating for people like Pettit how much their bills could decline if they adapted to time-of-use conditions. “We just didn’t have a lot of confidence in our numbers,” he conceded.

I said earlier this was wonky. Now you see why.

The bottom line for all Californians is that the changeover to time-of-use rates is a good thing and should help us better manage our energy resources, especially on hot summer days.

Edison could have explained this better. It should have explained this better.

But now you know."
