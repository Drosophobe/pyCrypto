2021-11-26 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin enters bear market territory as risk assets plunge on new Covid variant	['Ryan Browne']	"Bitcoin fell sharply after a sell-off of major U.S. stock indices. Bitcoin has been correlated closely to the price movement of the Nasdaq index.

Bitcoin fell sharply alongside other assets on Friday, hitting a seven-week low and officially entering bear market territory.

The world's biggest cryptocurrency sank nearly 8% in the last 24 hours to $54,321, according to Coin Metrics data. The slide brought bitcoin to its lowest level since early October.

Bitcoin is down more than 20% from an all-time high of nearly $69,000 which it hit earlier this month. Bear markets are typically defined by a decline of 20% or more from recent highs.

Other cryptocurrencies also plunged Friday. Ether, the second-biggest crypto, fell more than 10% to $4,059, while XRP slumped 9.9% to just under 95 cents.

Digital currencies are falling in tandem with other risk assets amid panic over a new, heavily-mutated variant of the coronavirus first detected in South Africa."
2021-11-08 00:00:00+00:00	The cryptocurrency market is now worth over $3 trillion. Here are 5 things that happened in the space this past week	['Taylor Locke']	"NFT.NYC signage outside the Nasdaq MarketSite during the Annual NonFungible Token (NFT) Event in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.

1. Over 5,000 people attend NFT.NYC conference

To celebrate their love for NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, over 5,000 people attended the NFT.NYC conference in Manhattan last week. The highly anticipated event, which left 3,000 people on a waitlist, began on November 1 and ended on Thursday. The week included 600 speakers on panels, as well as parties, dinners, raves, galleries and attractions. The people behind notable NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club threw an actual yacht party on the Hudson River, along with an owners-only concert by The Strokes at music venue Brooklyn Steel. NFT enthusiasts, top crypto influencers and mainstream celebrities all attended, including director Quentin Tarantino, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and comedian Chris Rock, to name a few. Throughout, attendees traded 700,000 event NFTs, according to CoinDesk.

2. 'Squid Game'-inspired cryptocurrency crashes

A cryptocurrency inspired by Netflix's hit TV series ""Squid Game"" crashed after its founders cashed out, CNBC reported on Tuesday. The token, called SQUID, hit a high of just over $2,861 on Nov. 1 before plummeting to near zero, according to price-tracking website CoinMarketCap.

CoinMarketCap issued a warning that it received ""multiple reports"" that users were unable able to sell the token on Pancakeswap, a popular decentralized exchange, and the token's white paper and website have since disappeared. It seems that the token's creators collected at least $3.4 million in investor funds. The incident appears to be a so-called ""rug pull,"" where project founders abandon a project and take investor funds with them.

3. Quentin Tarantino to offer seven uncut scenes from ‘Pulp Fiction’ as NFTs

On Tuesday, Quentin Tarantino announced plans to sell seven uncut scenes from ""Pulp Fiction"" as NFTs. Each will also include handwritten scripts from the film and audio commentary from Tarantino himself, which will only be able to be seen by owners of the NFT. The NFTs will be auctioned on marketplace OpenSea. A launch date has not yet been announced.

4. Incoming NY mayor Eric Adams vows to take first three paychecks in bitcoin

New York City mayor-elect Eric Adams plans to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin, he said in a tweet on Thursday. ""NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry,"" Adams wrote. On Wednesday, Adams also said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio that he wanted to wager a ""friendly competition"" with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who is a big bitcoin supporter. ""He has a MiamiCoin that is doing very well — we're going to look in the direction to carry that out,"" Adams told Bloomberg Radio, alluding that he's looking into creating a city coin for New York that is similar to Miami's.

Young', 'Martin Has Been Writing On Cybersecurity', 'Infotech For Over Two Decades. He Has Previous Trading Experience', 'Has Been Covering Developments In The Blockchain', 'Cryptocurrency Industry Since']	"Total crypto market capitalization has shrunk by $216 billion since yesterday in a fall that has dropped it to just below $2.78 trillion according to CoinGecko.

The massive wipe-out is the second of its kind this month after leveraged derivatives traders were liquidated on Nov. 11 resulting in a $125 billion slump.

On-chain analyst Dylan LeClair has again fingered leveraged positions for today’s massive slump.

The total market cap has now fallen back to early November levels as major crypto assets continue correcting from their recent all-time highs.

Bitcoin Leads the Drop

Bitcoin is leading markets into the red during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. BTC has lost 7.3% over the past 24 hours in a fall to around $61K at the time of writing.

The king of crypto has retreated 11.6% from its Nov. 10 all-time high of a touch over $69K. Pricing models such as stock-to-flow are still predicting larger gains for Bitcoin before the end of this year with a target price of $135K painted.

Despite this latest loss, BTC has still more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year when it was trading at around $29K. According to Tradingview, there is support at the 50-day moving average which is around the $58,800 price zone.

Bitcoin’s fall comes just a day or so after its Taproot privacy upgrade went live with no issues.

Altcoins Bleeding in Crypto Plunge

As usual, the rest of the crypto market is being dragged down by big brother. Ethereum has retreated 8% on the day in a tumble to $4,329 at the time of writing. ETH has now lost 11.2% from its all-time high of $4,878 also on Nov. 10.

The altcoin market is a sea of red at the moment with no token in the top 50 making a gain today. Binance Coin, Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Polkadot have all lost between 6% and 11% over the past 24 hours.

Larger losses are being felt by other altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Crypto.com (CRO) which have all decreased more than 12% on the day."
2021-11-26 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin retreats 20% from record, joining risk-asset sell-off	['Joanna Ossinger', 'Emily Graffeo']	"Bitcoin fell as much as 9 percent to $53,552 while Ether dropped more than 12 percent on Friday.

Bitcoin tumbled 20% from the record high it notched earlier this month as a potentially worrisome new variant of the coronavirus spurred traders to dump risk assets across the globe.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 9% to $53,552 on Friday. Ether, the second-largest digital currency, dropped more than 12%, while the wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index declined as much as 7.7%.

A new variant identified in southern Africa spurred liquidations across global markets, with European stocks falling the most since July and U.S. equity benchmarks also trading lower. Bitcoin wasn’t spared from the carnage despite increasingly being seen by many crypto enthusiasts as a hedge against financial-market turmoil. And even as Bitcoin has gained more mainstream acceptance, the cryptocurrency is still prone to wild swings.

“To us, it is still by and large a risk asset,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. “When things get kind of scary, there are going to be sellers.”

Meanwhile, gold — a traditional safe-haven asset — climbed as much as 1.5% Friday morning, though the precious metal has still significantly underperformed Bitcoin year to date.

“I think the role that Bitcoin will eventually play is still uncertain. The role that something like gold and Treasuries play is pretty well known at this point. So the conclusion is that when things really look ugly, the traditional safe havens will rise to the top,” Mayfield added.

The variant news that roiled markets wasn’t the only negative factor weighing on Bitcoin. Coming into this week, analysts cited a number of crypto obstacles including U.S. tax-reporting requirements for digital currencies, China’s intensifying regulatory clampdown, and India’s sights on a new bill that could ban most private cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has been under pressure since reaching a record of almost $69,000 earlier this month on enthusiasm over the first U.S. exchange-traded fund linked to futures on the digital asset. It is currently sitting near its 100-day moving average of $53,940, which served as support during its late-September pullback.

“Ironically, yesterday afternoon crypto markets were starting to look pretty optimistic with hopes of a Santa Claus rally,” said Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at crypto-derivatives exchange FTX, in a note Friday. It “will be a nervous weekend for sure.”

As ever, bulls remain committed to the view that more institutions and retail investors will embrace virtual currencies.

“This is a market reaction/correction within an uptrend,” said Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific at Luno Pte., who pointed out that options-expiration days — like Friday — can often be volatile. He said a drop down to the $48,000 to $50,000 range might be more concerning, and that “20% pullbacks are normal in a Bitcoin uptrend as we’ve seen many times before.”

Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said in a note Friday that two consecutive daily closes below the $52,900 level would increase the risk of a deeper pullback toward the next support level near $44,200. But that’s not a reason to sell, she said.

“We would hold long positions, for now, given the likelihood of a snapback rally in the days ahead from oversold territory noting intermediate-term momentum remains to the upside,” Stockton said.

For now, Bitcoin’s pullback is a sideshow to the global market declines on the new variant identified as B.1.1.529 as policy makers rush to retool cross-border travel policies.

The largest token is still up more than 85% this year."
2021-11-11 08:41:00+00:00	Crypto markets shudder as Evergrande fears re-emerge	['Lachlan Keller', 'Author Profile', 'Lachlan Is A Journalist', 'Producer At Forkast Working Melbourne', 'Australia. His Work Can Be Found In Numerous Magazines In Australia On Topics Ranging Culture To Science. Lachlan Holds A Bachelor S Degree In Journalism Macleay College In Australia.']	"The crypto market was rocked this morning Asia time as news that indebted Chinese property giant Evergrande may default on a US$148 million bond payment sent prices dropping around 5% across the board. Prices stabilized throughout the day, however, after the firm was able to make the payment at the last moment as the grace period deadline expired yesterday. With the company around US$300 billion in debt, there are concerns over the effect the company defaulting would have on global markets, both crypto and otherwise.

The price drop-off comes after days of strong price action among many leading tokens. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, both reached new all-time highs within hours of each other overnight before each losing more than 5% coming into business hours this morning, according to data from CoinGecko. Both following very similar price movements, Bitcoin reached US$69,044 just after midnight with Ethereum reaching a new level of US$4,878 shortly after.

This is not the first time concerns over Evergrande’s future have caused global markets to falter. In September a similar scare saw crypto markets losing around 9% as the company debt woes made headlines around the world, with the threat of its collapse, eliciting comparisons to the Lehman Brothers downfall that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008. The fallout from the pending default was not as acute this time around, but one market analyst told Forkast.News the company’s troubles are far from over.

“Every time [Evergrande] makes a payment, the clock starts ticking down for the next one, and I think the market’s very much aware that it’s always going to try and use that grace period [on its loans],” said Andrew Sullivan, founder and writer for Asianmarketsense.com. “It doesn’t have enough money to pay for everything on time, so it’s having to play swings and roundabouts, taking money from the left pocket to the right pocket … in order to pay different suppliers, different bondholders.”

With the exception of stablecoins, no tokens in the top 10 by market cap were spared the downturn, though some were more affected than others. Binance Coin, in third position, which had been making a run up on its all-time high it set back in May, had been trading at its highest point since that time before dropping 10% this morning. It has since recovered and was trading at US$630 at press time, according to CoinGecko.

Fifth-place Solana set its own all-time high of US$259 over the weekend in the leadup to the network’s first major global conference, Breakpoint, which was held in Lisbon earlier this week. Among the major developments announced at the conference was a US$100 million partnership with the venture firm of Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social media site Reddit, to invest in decentralized social media platforms to be built on the network. Solana saw a 7% decline in the two hours before trading this morning, but has recovered swiftly and was trading back near its mid-week high at US$246 as of press time, according to CoinGecko.

After sitting in third position for much of the past few months in the leadup to its long-awaited Alonzo upgrade, which was to bring smart contract capabilities to the network, Cardano has been in slow decline since early September. An impressive price run earlier in the week seemed to suggest a change in fortunes for the network, gaining 20% in a matter of days to reach a one-month high of US$2.36. Its price retreated from this point quickly, however, and with the 9% drop off this morning, most of the gains of the past week were erased. It was trading at US$2.15 at press time, according to CoinGecko.

While the company — like the global economy — is not out of the woods yet, today’s payment has bought Evergrande some time, with the next major payment not being due until early 2022. Nonetheless, the company is still rife with liquidity issues and has had to resort to extreme measures to get money together. Company employees have been told they must give the firm short-term loans if they wish to receive their bonuses, and company founder and chairman Xu Jiayin put a luxury house in Hong Kong he owns as loan collateral at the request of company creditors.

Speculation abounds as to whether the Chinese government would allow Evergrande to fail, or would step in to save the company, though Sullivan does not believe that it would, instead that it may attempt to apply subtle pressure to other developers to help the flailing behemoth out. Evergrande’s competitors may be disinterested in stepping in as many of the company’s projects are already pre-sold, and so would yield little capital in return. While this has been done in the past, it was while the markets were much healthier, and Sullivan speculates some competitors may be holding off on buying any assets until the prices come down even further.

The real estate market has had enormous economic and cultural value to the world’s most populous nation, and if it were to collapse it would be disastrous for the country and its people. “People in China view property to a large extent as their bank, this is their pension,” Sullivan said, explaining as the housing market was slowing down, the Chinese government was trying to shift the economy towards the production of high-end technological goods, such as semiconductors.

China has taken a progressively hard-line approach to cryptocurrency this year starting with a crackdown on mining throughout the country before putting a blanket ban of all cryptocurrency-related transactions in September due to the government’s belief crypto is disrupting the economic and financial order.

Sullivan said the strong market action recently could have raised tensions with would-be investors within the country, but the government has taken advantage of the current moment to smooth over the cryptocurrency issue — among others.

“People are naturally going to be resentful of the fact that they’ve been banned from that market,” Sullivan said. “How much they can do about it, how much that’s going to sway the government [it’s] difficult to say. The thing about Covid is that it’s allowing [the government] to be very, very draconian, to close China down, to make sure people aren’t aware of what’s going on outside so much as they would have before. So that suits [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping].”"
2021-11-19 05:48:36+00:00	Bitcoin, dogecoin, Shiba Inu, other cryptocurrency prices crash today. Check latest rates	[]	"Bitcoin price continued its slide as the digital token slipped below $57,000 for the first time since October, in a retreat from record highs. he world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency was trading over 6% lower at $56,328.8. Bitcoin recently hit record high of around $69,000 and is up over 93% this year (year-to-date or YTD) so far.

Global crypto market cap slipped to $2.6 trillion, according tracker CoinGecko. Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, while Ether is up about sixfold. Both scaled records last week amid a fervor for digital assets driven by speculative demand and controversial arguments that they can hedge inflation risks.

“Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major altcoins have remained subdued almost 3 days in succession. On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin can be seen traversing within a channel pattern, frequently retesting the support of $58,000 mark. The RSI indicator has fallen below 40, a sign that the token is close to being oversold. We could soon expect a reversal in the trends based on the current scenario and the general optimism surrounding bitcoin,"" said Siddharth Menon, COO of WazirX.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest cryptocurrency, also declined more than 4% to $4,075. Ether price has been trading around all-time high, catching up with bitcoin's rally and riding on news of wider blockchain adoption.

""The bullish market for two weeks has suddenly seen corrections from three days. The event got triggered by Twitter CFO Mr Ned commenting that it no more looks safe to continue investing into crypto. During bull markets the prices increase and sometimes this adds instability till it finds the trigger and it seems that is what just happened. On the other side, the crypto markets are slowly growing big towards becoming immune from influencers,"" said Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin.

Meanwhile, dogecoin price plunged over 5% to $0.22 whereas Shiba Inu also crashed 10% to $0.000043. The performance of other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, XRP, Polkadot, Uniswap, Stellar, Cardano, Solana also were trading with cuts over the last 24 hours.

2021-11-25 05:17:11+00:00	Bitcoin Price in India Today Slightly Up Following Sudden Market Crash Amid Panic	['About The Author']	"Amid the news of cryptocurrency being regulated by the government soon, crypto investors were in a panic mode since a day back. The prices of Bitcoin, Solana and other cryptocurrencies fell a day ago, but rose slightly on Thursday, November 25, as markets began to stabilise after the initial ripple effect. The government, two days ago, listed a Bill to be tabled during the winter session of the Parliament. The Bill, ‘Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency’ Bill, has sought to put a ban on the private digital tokens barring a few and introduce the Central Bank Digital Currency of the Reserve Bank of India instead.

Bitcoin was trading at Rs 43,69,008 in the Indian market, crypto trading website WazirX showed. This was slightly up from the 34,00,000 mark which the world’s largest cryptocurrency had registered on Wednesday, November 24. Cryptocurrency prices in the Indian market declined up to 20 per cent on Wednesday as investors in a panic mode began selling their assets.

“On Tuesday night, we saw huge selling in the rupee (INR-crypto) market on WazirX. We saw a 15-20 per cent crash in prices once investors engaged in panic selling. However, the market is showing recovery and is at a 3-4 per cent discount currently. A similar knee-jerk reaction was seen in January, when the contents of the bill were disclosed,” WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty was quoted as saying by Times of India.

A bill to ban all private cryptocurrencies in India, with a few expectations to promote blockchain technology will be introduced in the upcoming winter session of the Parliament, the government said. “The Bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses,” the bulletin listing the legislative business posted on Lok Sabha’s website said.

The Reserve Bank is also planning to launch its own digital currency. “To create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India,” it added. The Lok Sabha bulletin did not provide any other details about the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.

According to a report by CNBC TV18, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said that out of the 600 odd cryptocurrencies that exist in the Indian crypto market, only two or three will survive post the enactment of the upcoming Bill.

“If things have value only because they because they will be pricier down the line, that’s a bubble,” Rajan told CNBC-TV18, “…a lot of cryptos have value only because there is a greater fool out there willing to buy.”

The former RBI governor compared the current mania regarding cryptocurrency in India to that of the tulip mania in Netherlands in the 17th century.

But in the current scenario, experts are urging investors not to take a decision out of panic.

“The crypto industry is hopeful that the government will involve the industry stakeholders while drafting the bill. At CoinSwitch Kuber, we shall follow the directions provided by the government. As of now, I urge all crypto asset investors in the country to remain calm, do their own research before arriving at a rushed conclusion. Investors should wait for a government statement on this matter and not rely on secondary sources of information,” said Ashish Singhal, founder and CEO of CoinSwitch Kuber.

The government has repeatedly ensured that it will not totally ban cryptocurrency in India, and only private coins will be regulated. A regulation mechanism will be in place so that crypto is not misused. The government is concerned about the underground transactions happening against cryptocurrency — particularly its role in ‘hawala’ and terror funding,” sources told CNN-News18 on Wednesday.
