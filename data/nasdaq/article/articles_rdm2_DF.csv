2020-06-08 16:00:02+00:00	Why An Even Deeper Correction Is Expected For The Crypto Market’s Hottest Altcoin	"[""I'M Tony Spilotro. Behind The Pseudonym"", ""I'M A Global Remote Work Leader With A Decade Of Award-Winning Content Experience"", 'Excellence. Here', 'I Explore My Newfound Passions Pertaining To Privacy', 'Finance', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Cryptography', 'Property Rights', 'Other Libertarian-Esque Views. I Am A Bitcoin Evangelist']"	"The crypto asset known as Theta was the hottest altcoin in the space during May, but false rumors of a partnership with Google led to a strong selloff.

The downside in the cryptocurrency looks to continue, as two highly accurate sell signals have triggered on weekly timeframes on both the USD and BTC trading pairs.

Theta Pumps Nearly 400% Against the Dollar in May, 350% Against Bitcoin

At the start of May to the peak of the pump, the altcoin known as Theta rallied over 360% against Bitcoin. There was a matching nearly 400% rise on the USD trading pair.

The rally was fueled by false information spreading about a partnership with Google, however, it was later revealed that the partnership was simply Theta relying on Google’s cloud services on the client-side.

While no true partnership exists, the massive surge brought back memories of the crypto hype bubble.

During that time, it wasn’t uncommon to see altcoins rally hundreds of percent against Bitcoin or the dollar.

While those days are long gone, and money won’t be as easy to come by during the next cycle, Theta’s recent explosion provides much-needed hope that a return to a crypto bull market may soon be coming.

But before any sustained bullish advance or uptrend begins, Theta is due for a stronger correction, according go a duo of highly accurate sell signals across the THETAUSD and THETABTC trading pairs.

USD & BTC Sell Signals Could Cause The Attractive Altcoin To Dump Further

Over the last month, few altcoins were discussed as highly as Theta. The asset quickly became the crypto industry’s hottest token.

But as soon as overly eager investors realized the partnership news was a non-event, a selloff cut the gains back significantly.

More downside is also very likely, given a set of sell setups signaled by the TD Sequential indicator on weekly timeframes.

The TD Sequential indicator is a market-timing tool developed by Thomas Demark. After a specific sequence of candles form, it often is a sign that a reversal or pullback is near.

The signal has called many Bitcoin and altcoin tops and bottoms over the last several years, dating back to Bitcoin’s all-time high. It’s proven that its a tool that should never be underestimated.

The 9 sell setup has appeared on both THETAUSD and THETABTC price charts, suggesting that not only is a collapse in USD value expected, but the altcoin will underperform against Bitcoin in the days ahead.

TD 9 sell signals have appeared across most cryptocurrency assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, and countless others. The crypto market’s best performer, Theta, also sharing this signal doesn’t bode well for the entire asset class.

Crypto as a whole often follows Bitcoin’s lead, and while sentiment and fundamentals have never been more bullish for Bitcoin, the asset is also facing its strongest resistance yet.

Should another crash happen in Bitcoin ahead of a clean breakout from the downtrend, a lower high could cause extreme panic and a selloff will soon follow.

Bitcoin crashing from here would carry the entire crypto market down with it, Theta included."

He Studied At The University Of California Irvine', 'Has Been Interested In Bitcoin', 'The Crypto Markets Since']	"Ethereum has decline today alongside Bitcoin and the aggregated crypto market, breaking below a key support level that was previously being defended by buyers

It now appears that ETH could be well positioned to see even further downside in the days and weeks ahead

One technical indicator is forecasting that it will plunge to $200 before it is able to garner any notable buying pressure

This could lead it to break below a key support level, and catalyze a far-reaching downtrend

Prior to yesterday evening, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the aggregated crypto market had been caught within a consolidation phase that persisted for many weeks.

Although the overnight decline seen by most major cryptocurrencies did cause them to shatter the lower boundaries of these consolidation channels, it is important to note that buyers have still defended several key levels.

In the case of Etheereum, although the crypto was previously flashing some signs of immense strength, its dependence on Bitcoin has made it prone to the weakness seen by the entire crypto market today.

That being said, one technical indicator is now suggesting that it will continue plunging until it reaches $200.

This would force it below a key support level, and potentially kick off a notable downtrend in the weeks ahead.

Ethereum Declines Alongside Entire Crypto Market; Key Support Fast Approaches

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down just under 6% at its current price of $222.65. It has been flashing some intense signs of weakness throughout the past 12 hours, as it has also declined by over 2% against its Bitcoin trading pair.

It does appear that this weakness will extend further in the near-term, as this latest decline forced it below $230 – the level that marked the lower boundary of its previous trading range.

One analyst also explained that $215 is an important level for it to maintain above. This happens to be around the point at which it was finding significant resistance throughout most of May – as seen in the below chart.

Here’s Why ETH Could Soon Reel Towards $200

There is one respected technical indicator that suggests Ethereum is poised to post a notable decline in the days and weeks ahead.

Another prominent analyst spoke about this technical indicator in a recent tweet, explaining that it shows ETH is likely to reel towards $200 before finding any notable support, while also showing that Bitcoin could soon hit $8,500.

“BTC and ETH Cloud pretty clear on targets here. 8.5 and 200. Another way to think of this: HH less probable than retrace/mean reversion,” he explained while pointing to the below chart.

How Ethereum trends in the days ahead should provide valuable insights into just how much technical damage was done by its recent price decline.

2020-06-10 15:11:29+00:00	Cryptocurrency News Roundup for June 10, 2020	[]	"In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has been range-bound between $9,570 and $9,870. The flagship crypto broke out above the $9,800 level, giving many traders hope that the $10,000 milestone was in sight. However, it was pushed back shortly afterwards and is trading at $9,750 at press time.

While Bitcoin is yet to make a decisive move, some other cryptos are on the up and up. DOGE and LINK have been some of the most promising, with the latter looking set to hit its all-time high price.

Bitcoin’s Indecisive Movement

Bitcoin’s price is up by a mere 0.6% in the past 24 hours. As BeInCrypto reported earlier today, the price broke out from a short-term descending resistance line that has been in place since June 5. This suggests that the price is likely to move up in the short-term. It is, however, unlikely to affect the crypto’s long-term price movements.

A breakout from its current level could take it up to $9,950. However, if a rejection occurs, the price could drop to the $9,450 support level. This would most likely lead the crypto to test the $9,000 support level in the short-term.

Read the full analysis here.

ChainLink and Dogecoin on the Uptrend

Despite Bitcoin’s indecisive movement, some altcoins have shown great promise. One of these is Dogecoin (DOGE) which seems to be on the verge of a breakout after bouncing on the support line of a bullish pattern. According to one expert, the current surge will see Dogecoin hit $0.0032. The just-for-laughs coin is trading at $0.00257.

ChainLink (LINK) is yet another altcoin that seems poised to break out. The crypto has been on an uptrend in the past two months but is approaching a crucial resistance level that will determine its short-term future. The price looks set to test its all-time high, which it achieved on March 3. The price is expected to hit $4.9 shortly.

Bitcoin Could Lose Its Throne in a Few Years

Bitcoin has remained perched on top of the crypto world since launch, but this may not be the case for much longer. BTC’s dominance has been dwindling since September last year and currently sits at 64.7%. According to one expert, Bitcoin’s inefficiencies, lack of smart contracts and slow transaction speed will be its ultimate downfall.

Bitcoin’s dominance has also broken away from its price. In the past, its price was positively correlated to its dominance, but as BeInCrypto recently reported, the trend has changed.

A Third of European Investors Own Crypto

In confirmation of the rise of crypto ownership in Europe, a new report has revealed that a third of European investors own crypto. The report by Fidelity showed that European investors are more confident in cryptos than their American counterparts. Bitcoin is still the most popular crypto in Europe with a 25% holding, while Ethereum comes in second at 11%.

There are several concerns, however, for investors with price volatility being the most common one. Market manipulation is also a major concern, according to the study.

According to cryptocurrency research platform Coinpaprika and global crypto exchange OKEx, India is poised to gain considerable global market share of crypto transactions this year.

The report published last week showcased that the trading volume of Indian crypto exchange platforms, CoinDCX and WazirX, witnessed an increase in the trading volume since the ease of cryptocurrency trade policy in the country. As per Similarweb, the website traffic of major crypto exchanges from India has increased during 2020 Q1.

Furthermore, the report revealed that OKEx’s visits from India saw the highest increase, reaching 545.56%. It claimed that newly registered users from India rose by 4100% during the same period. The global crypto exchange platform is now eyeing India and has plans to launch P2P trading platform in the country soon, which will allow Indian users to buy Bitcoins, Etherium and other digital currencies with INR via multiple payment channels.

Previously, another global crypto exchange platform Kraken had also announced that it will be expanding to the Indian market this year. With this, the crypto market in India is expected to get fierce in the coming months.

However, the crypto market still faces challenges in terms of lack of clear regulatory policies, including tax obligations. Also, there is no clarity in terms of how cryptocurrency can be used for cross-border transactions or for conversion into more stable currencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium. More than anything, the market is influenced by political factors, and any fluctuation or move towards a decentralised market, Bitcoin may no longer be necessary for Indians.

At the same time, as a utility token, the demand for Bitcoin has significantly increased in countries where the fiat currency has depreciated in value.

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of writing was $10,103.5, with a market cap of $185 Bn, compared to last week (May 26, 2020) which stood at $8,821.92, with a market cap of $162 Bn. Interestingly, Bitcoin on Monday (June 1) the price increased by almost $1,000 in less than 12 hours.

Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, was priced at $247, with a market cap of $27 Bn at the time of writing, compared to last week (May 26, 2020), where the price of the cryptocurrency was $202, with a market cap of $22 Bn.

According to Option trader, Theta Seek stated that for this incredible feat to happen is to envision consistent buying demand from retail investors. The trader said:

“At 100K per BTC, the market has to absorb a miner supply of $90 Million USD daily. Assuming that there are 10 million people worldwide buying BTC on a regular basis. It would cost them each $9 daily to sustain those price levels. I’ve met people who spend more than $9 on coffee.”

“Data suggests otherwise though, hodlers throughout the past three all-time highs have not been selling in significant portions. 60% of BTC has not moved for more than 2 years. Even if that were to be true, the longtime supply of BTC will eventually equal the mining (new) supply.”

2020-06-15 22:04:40+00:00	Crypto map reveals the most ‘Bitcoin maximalist’ country on earth	['Decrypt', 'Mat Di Salvo']	"An interactive map of cryptocurrency interest has been compiled by a researcher at Blockchaincenter.net.

Using data from Google Trends, the map shows where in the world Bitcoin interest is most concentrated, and where altcoin searches thrive.

The results may be unsurprising to those who have been keeping a close eye on Bitcoin in developing economies.

A new, interactive map created by Blockchaincenter.net is taking a look at cryptocurrency search interest by country of 10 of the most popular cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA, Monero, Tron, Dogecoin, and Cardano—with data sourced from Google Trends.

According to the data, by far the most searched for coin in all countries is Bitcoin, with a dominance of 80.8%. Ethereum falls far behind in second place, at 13.7%.

And the country where Bitcoin most dominates search interest is, perhaps surprisingly to some, Kenya—where 94.7% of cryptocurrency searches within the country were related to the biggest coin by market cap.

The news that Kenya is the most ""Bitcoin maximalist"" country may not come as a shock at all to those keeping a close eye on the region, given that several crypto industry players consider Africa to be the future of Bitcoin.

The continent has been using Bitcoin for years, in part because it is full of emerging economies and there is little resistance to new financial technology. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and payment provider Square, last year said that the continent would define the future of Bitcoin.

Sad to be leaving the continent…for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020. Grateful I was able to experience a small part. 🌍 pic.twitter.com/9VqgbhCXWd — jack (@jack) November 27, 2019

Kenya in particular is witnessing a digital revolution. The East African country has a booming startup scene and it was there that the M-Pesa, a mobile payment system for Kenyans without bank accounts, was created.

Other African countries made the top 10 Bitcoin maximalist list—with Nigeria (89.4%) and South Africa (89%) in fifth and sixth place respectively. Nigeria and South Africa, incidentally, have seen considerable growth in terms of local Bitcoin trading as of late. In fact, according to data from metrics site Useful Tulips, Africa once again broke its weekly BTC trading volume record in late May, with Nigeria leading the way.

Elsewhere on the globe, however, is where altcoins get their shine. According to the interactive map, it is Eastern Europe that appears to be the most interested in altcoins. Russia and Ukraine top the list for countries where altcoins are most searched for in Google, with Serbia in third place.

Despite Bitcoin topping the most-searched coin in all countries, market cap ranking does not mirror search volume ranking, Blockchaincenter.net says. For example, Dogecoin is not in the top 30 by market cap but makes the cut in the top 10 of most searched cryptocurrencies.

2020-06-01 10:05:02+00:00	India to Significantly Increase Crypto Market Share This Year: Report – Bitcoin News	['Kevin Helms', 'A Student Of Austrian Economics', 'Kevin Found Bitcoin In', 'Has Been An Evangelist Ever Since. His Interests Lie In Bitcoin Security', 'Open-Source Systems', 'Network Effects', 'The Intersection Between Economics']	"India to Significantly Increase Crypto Market Share This Year: Report

India’s cryptocurrency market is set to gain significant market share this year, according to an industry report. The regulatory environment, the instability of the rupee, and remittances are key drivers that will send the Indian crypto industry soaring.

Indian Crypto Sector Flourishing

The Indian cryptocurrency market is poised to gain considerable global market share starting this year, according to a report published last week by Coinpaprika and Okex. The former is a cryptocurrency research platform while the latter a global crypto exchange. They analyzed the Indian crypto sector, major players, the challenges they face, and the rapid development of the country’s crypto ecosystem.

“India is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets, gradually catching up on cryptocurrency development,” the two companies wrote, elaborating:

We attribute the driving force of the Indian cryptocurrency market development to three significant factors, namely immigrants, finance, and government policies … It is expected that the global market share of crypto transactions in the Indian market will increase significantly in 2020-2022.

Key Factors Behind Rapid Growth of Indian Crypto Sector

The report attributes the rapid growth of the Indian crypto industry to three key factors. The first is cross-border remittances. “The amount of remittances by Indian immigrants has been the highest in the world over the years,” the report details, citing that the country had more than 17 million immigrants in 2019. Since cross-border transactions traditionally carry high fees, Coinpaprika and Okex believe that “Using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a cross-border payment medium, Indians can save a large number of remittance fees,” adding:

Cryptocurrency as a cross-border payment medium will make a big difference in the Indian market. Due to great remittance demand, it will drive the prosperity of digital currency growth in India for a long time.

The next factor concerns the instability of the Indian rupee and Indians’ strong demand for U.S. dollars, the report outlines. “The value of Indian rupee is not stable, especially during the covid-19 epidemic … The exchange rate between rupee and USD continued to rise, causing the former to enter constant depreciation … with the constant depreciation of the rupee, the Indians have a strong need to convert their rupee into a more stable fiat currency,” the report describes, noting:

However, due to strict foreign exchange regulations, it is complicated to convert rupee directly to US dollars. Therefore, most Indians will choose to convert rupee to bitcoin and then to US dollars through C2C trading platforms such as Localbitcoins and Paxful.

“Many rupees are exchanged to bitcoin through chat groups, such as Whatsapp, Telegram, and Facebook, which then converted into US dollars,” research by Coinpaprika and Okex shows. “To maintain their asset’s value, cryptocurrency is being used as a vehicle to convert rupee into more stable fiat currency in India.”

The third factor is the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency in India. In March, the country’s supreme court quashed the banking restriction imposed by the central bank which has had profound effects on the local crypto industry. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently confirmed in a reply to a Right to Information (RTI) request that there is no longer any banking ban on crypto exchanges, companies, or traders.

“After the policy was loosened, the increase in trading volume was not only reflected in local exchanges, but also the major global exchanges,” the report continues. According to Similarweb, a website analytics data provider, traffic on major crypto exchanges from India increased many-fold in Q1 2020. The report further highlights:

Okex’s visits from India saw the highest increase, reaching 545.56%. According to Okex, newly registered users from India rose 4100% during the same period.

Besides Okex, several other crypto exchanges have reported huge growth in trading volumes and new users. For example, two prominent local exchanges, Wazirx and Unocoin, independently told news.Bitcoin.com that they experienced 10X volume growth as Indians explored crypto trading during the extended nationwide lockdown. Moreover, new crypto exchanges are launching in India, global exchanges are expanding in the country, and more venture capitalists are investing in Indian crypto startups.

Okex is preparing to launch a P2P trading platform in India where a number of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin (BTC) and tether (USDT), can be traded against the Indian rupee via several payment channels. Kraken also said that it plans to expand into India this year. “The competition between local and global major crypto exchanges in the Indian market will become increasingly fierce,” the report concludes. “Exchanges are expected to steer their focus on enhancing the stability of their derivatives products and offering more diverse depositing channels for users.” As for the entire Indian economy, Goldman Sachs’ strategists have predicted that the country’s recession will be its worst ever.

"['George Georgiev', 'More Posts This Author', 'About The Author', ""Georgi Georgiev Is Cryptopotato'S Editor-In-Chief"", 'A Seasoned Writer With Over Two Years Of Experience Writing About Blockchain', ""Cryptocurrencies. Georgi'S Passion For Bitcoin"", 'Cryptocurrencies Bloomed In Late', ""He Hasn'T Looked Back Since. Crypto S Technological"", 'Economic Implications Are What Interest Him Most', 'He Has One Eye Turned To The Market Whenever He S Not Sleeping.']"	"Bitcoin surged above $10,000 for the first time since February, and it took the entire market with it. Altcoins are all flashing in green, as the total capitalization increased by more than $13 billion overnight.

Now, a popular cryptocurrency trader pointed out that the chart of the total market cap went through the same pattern it did back in 2017, months before altcoins shot off through the roof.

Altcoin Season 2020 Incoming?

Bitcoin is up 6% in the past 24 hours as it trades at around $10,100 for the first time since February. As the leading cryptocurrency makes its way above this coveted level, altcoins are also blossoming.

All of the large-cap projects are seeing notable gains. Ethereum is up more than 4%, Bitcoin Cash – more than 7.5%, Litecoin – 6.3%, and so forth.

The total market capitalization increased by as much as $13 billion during the past hours, and this has given a popular cryptocurrency trader reason to believe that it may be time for a new altcoin season.

ADVERTISEMENT

Well-known crypto trader Kaleo thinks that we are on the brink of the next altcoin outburst.

As seen in the above chart, the total market cap went through a similar pattern it did back in March 2017. Needless to say, in 2017, altcoins marked their all-time highs across the board while the total market cap exceeded $800 billion.

What’s Different This Time?

When it comes to determining whether or not the market is in a state of the so-called “altcoin season,” the key metric to look at is Bitcoin’s dominance – its share of the cryptocurrency relative to the total market capitalization.

Back in March 2017, BTC’s dominance was at a high point of around 85% – this is 20% more than what it currently stands at.

Going forward in 2017, Bitcoin’s dominance continued to decrease while altcoins increased their share, as evident in the chart above.

In January 2018, which was arguably the peak of the parabolic altcoin season, BTC’s dominance was at around 33%, while altcoins were surging.

If we are to see anything remotely close to what happened back then, Bitcoin would need to lose about 30% of its current market share. This doesn’t mean that its price has to decline – it simply means that altcoins need to surpass its growth."

Previously She Covered Institutional Investing"", 'Fintech For Several Major Trade Publications. Gerelyn Resides In Verona']"	"Crypto investment fund manager Grayscale Investments recently saw the value of its AUM reach $3.8 billion, up from $2.1 billion in May 2019. The average weekly investment into the trust has increased by over 800% vs. Q1 2019’s $3.2 million. Ray Sharif-Askary, director of investor relations and business development at Grayscale, explained how it’s been a record year and record quarter for the firm, noting that they’ve never seen demand like this before for their products. She explained the impact from the pandemic broadly speaking, saying:

“From a broader perspective, COVID-19 and the policy implications especially have really set the stage for bitcoin to be seen as a store of value asset that we had hoped that it eventually would be. You have, institutional investors are taking active long positions in digital assets through our products and it’s because they’re looking for an asset that is scarce and that can be used as an inflation hedge in a world where we’re faced with unprecedented monetary stimulus.”

Grayscale manages the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and other funds tied to altcoins.

“In Q1 we raised over half a billion dollars across all our products. About $390 million of that was into our bitcoin trust. We also saw about $110 million in the Ethereum product. And I think we’d be remiss not to look at the broader narrative there, which is that we continue to see diversification. Right now about 38% of our investors are allocated to multiple Grayscale products. About a year ago that number was a little under 30%. So it’s certainly encouraging to see investors allocate and diversify within the digital currency asset class just like they would any other traditional asset class.”

Grayscale has $3.8 billion in AUM and the largest gold ETF has approximately $10 billion. Nisa asked when Grayscale will overtake its rival store-of-value asset.

“Over the last 12 months, we actually raised over $1 billion into our 10 products. It would be great to see that demand remain constant and to even increase. I think it’s impossible to say when we’ll overtake the world’s largest gold ETF. But i do know that the idea of bitcoin as digital gold and as a store of value is only becoming more and more prevalent. And so as investors think about finding uncorrelated sources of alpha your guess is as good as mine.”"

Capital One Services, which deals in credit cards and auto loans, says its system uses AI technology for âanalyzing [the] credibility of cryptocurrency-related information.â

Humans face barely surmountable obstacles and pressures when they trade crypto, the filing states.

The market runs 24/7 and it requires investors to know the intricacies and nuances of very distinct protocols as well as watch out for events such as airdrops, forks or hacks that come streaming in from multiple sources including Twitter, Medium posts and crypto news sites, the content of which cannot always be readily verified.

âIt would be impossible for human traders to track all of the above-mentioned cryptocurrency-related data and respond to that data in real-time,â the patent reads. âFurther, it would also be difficult to verify the credibility of the cryptocurrency-related information in real time. In particular, it is difficult to verify the credibility of speculation, rumors, opinions and other information posted on social media and elsewhere.â

Awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last week (patent no. 10,679,229), Capital Oneâs AI verification system can be split into three crucial components.

Related: Why High-Profile Defections Arenât Libraâs Biggest Challenge

First, the system has a specific AI program that looks out for one kind of information such as tweets. After finding a potentially noteworthy event, it feeds it back to a âcredibility analysis engine,â which cross-references and determines whether the event is credible based on historical examples and, if so, how the market has responded in previous instances.

It then collects all the information, processes it and uses it to make quick trading decisions.

Capital One said the AI engine could become nuanced and sophisticated at interpreting information. The system might be able to detect fake volumes and evaluate the speed by which news, such as an exchange hack, goes viral across various social media platforms and news sites.

âThe machine-learning algorithm,â the patent reads, âcan also determine the reach â¦ and how quickly the news spreads out, what investors said and felt â¦ on social media as the news was spreading out, how long it took for the initial fear, if any, to fade out, for the âbuy-the-bottomâ mood to arise, as well as for the market to bounce back up.â

But Capital One says its patent will need further nuance before it can be launched as a new service (and generally, the filing of a patent does not necessarily indicate intention to launch a product). Itâs unclear as it stands whether the system could execute trades autonomously or whether they would have to be okayâd by a human first.

Like the rest of the U.S. banking sector, the broader Capital One group blocked account holders from purchasing crypto using their credit cards in early 2018. The bank has defended its decision, saying it wants to shield clients from the high levels of fraud, loss and inherent volatility in crypto.

This same sentiment is reflected in the patent filing: âAs with many nascent markets, many cryptocurrency investors rushed into the market without adequate knowledge and experience in either trading or cryptocurrencies. In fact, many of the cryptocurrency investors were trapped by short-term market movement and lost money quickly.â

TBut then again, Capital One knows the traps and pitfalls of crypto firsthand. Last year, an ex-Amazon employee hacked into the bankâs internal systems, exposed the personal and financial data of over 100 million customers and used the company servers to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies.

The day stocks became cryptocurrencies

This kind of comparison between equities and crypto first started to appear in late February when the most precious stock market sell-off in history only started gaining momentum.



As reported by U.Today, the S&P 500 chart looked like your casual Bitcoin dump on Feb. 28 when crypto was still relatively stable.



Things got really ugly in early March when it was clear that Bitcoin became highly correlated to the broader market. On March 12, BTC logged its biggest daily loss in seven years (more than 51 percent) when the overleveraged market crumbled under selling pressure.

On March, 15, the S&P 500 tanked 11.98 percent, which was the third-biggest drop in the history of the index that was first introduced in 1923.



This was followed by a speedy V-shaped recovery for both Bitcoin and stocks in Q2.





Another volatile trading session

On June 11, the most brutal day on Wall Street since March, the Dow, another benchmark stock index, shed almost seven percent (1,862 points).



This carnage wasn’t ignored by cryptocurrency investors -- Bitcoin dropped more than eight percent.



Despite a strong opening, the stock market rally quickly hit a snag after the Federal Reserve warned about the ‘quite persistent’ economic damage of the pandemic and dragged BTC to an intraday low of $9,230 on the Bitstamp exchange.

Bitcoin has since recovered to its current price of $9,428 in tandem with equities as volatility continues to persist."

Despite the havoc coronavirus has wreaked on markets, the fund did better in those four months than the stock index did in any full year since 1997. And as a result of the climb, the fund returned 73% for those who invested from day one and held on through to last month.

Goldman Sachs – Investment Advisory Call

Goldman Sachs held an investment advisory call for its clients during which it slammed bitcoin as an investment and refused to accept it as an asset class.

A CoinDesk columnist who used to work at Goldman Sachs gives her views on what they get wrong about bitcoin, pointing out “the fact someone else is willing to pay a higher price for a given instrument is probably the only criteria necessary to know something is a suitable investment.”

Peter McCormack was joined by Bill Barhydt, CEO and Founder of Abra, on the Whatbitcoindid podcast to discuss Goldman’s arguments against bitcoin and the reasons behind their research.

“It’s their financial incentive, for their client base to not want to put 10% of their assets in bitcoin.”

On his YouTube channel in a video entitled “Down the Rabbit Hole”, Antonopoulos describes how falling oil prices will benefit crypto miners by providing cheaper electricity worldwide.

He views theis as an opportunity for US crypto miners to become competitive with Chinese miners. He specifically mentions the new Bitmain mining facility recently opened in Texas."

Amidst the global pandemic, the digital assets market has been suffering huge fluctuations, While stablecoins have managed to hold their position in the market.

The Stablecoin market sees heavy growth this year, reaching great heights. According to the report, the total market cap of the stablecoin market has reached $11 billion.

Amidst the global pandemic, the digital assets market has been suffering huge fluctuations. There had been better days for the cryptocurrency market. However, stablecoins have managed to hold their position in the market. In the month of January, it was somewhat above $5 billion. In February it crossed the $7 billion mark. Further, in May it crossed the $10 billion mark.

Stablecoins as the name suggests is a stable form of cryptocurrency whose values are often pegged to a fiat currency. Talking about the potential of the stablecoins, they can boost the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the stablecoin markets may widely benefit the remittance market for people who work overseas and send money to their families. The stablecoins that are mainly contributing to the digital assets market are USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD, DAI, GUSD, BUSD, and HUSD.

The Tremendous Growth of Tether

In the second week of February, 82% of the total stable coin market trade was controlled by Tether (USDT). In March, when the stablecoin market crossed the 7 billion dollar market, USDT contributed 87% of the trade volume. Reports say that Tether stablecoin minted 1.6 Billion tokens in the month of April and 480 million tokens, already in the first week of May.

As of now, Tether’s assets’ current valuation is at $9.88 billion, the stablecoinindex reports say. Which means that Tether USDT has successfully become the third-largest cryptocurrency in the world after displacing XRP to the 4th position, for the first time in history. However, Tether’s growth comes as insecurity for Ether. It is highly probable that in the coming future Tether may surpass Ether to become the second-largest cryptocurrency.

But as USDT continues to mint more and more tokens daily, crypto experts are thinking whether this may be a reason to worry. However, according to a study in April, the rate of minting of stablecoins doesn’t inflate or affect the cryptocurrency market in any way."

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Goldman Sachs isn't convinced there's a case for investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Crypto evangelists — perhaps unsurprisingly — aren't impressed with its assessment. The U.S. bank's consumer and investment management division released a slide deck ahead of an investor call Wednesday, examining the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the U.S. economy. A sizable chunk of the presentation focused on bitcoin and other virtual currencies. ""Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are not an asset class,"" Goldman Sachs' Investment Strategy Group wrote in the opening of one slide. The deck detailed several reasons why cryptocurrencies couldn't be considered an asset class in their own right, claiming they don't generate cash flow likes bonds or earnings through exposure to global economic growth. ""We believe that a security whose appreciation is primarily dependent on whether someone else is willing to pay a higher price for it is not a suitable investment for our clients,"" the group wrote.

""We also believe that while hedge funds may find trading cryptocurrencies appealing because of their high volatility, that allure does not constitute a viable investment rationale."" Many industry analysts have been pointing to increased interest from institutional investors like hedge funds as a potential catalyst for price rises. Such speculation grew after hedge fund veteran Paul Tudor Jones said earlier this month that he has almost 2% of his assets in bitcoin. Crypto enthusiasts had eagerly anticipated the Goldman call, with some assuming the 151-year-old bank might lay out a case for investing in bitcoin. Needless to say, they didn't get what they wanted on Wednesday. The Winklevoss twins, co-founders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, were among the most vocal in the backlash to Goldman's claims. ""Hey Goldman Sachs, 2014 just called and asked for their talking points back,"" Cameron Winklevoss said in a tweet. His brother, Tyler, claimed, ""The more I think about it, the Goldman report is probably a head fake,"" referring to a sports tactic used to throw an opponent off by pretending you're moving in one direction only to then move the opposite way. Goldman drew a comparison between bitcoin's monster rally in late 2017 — when it surged close to $20,000 — and the Dutch ""tulip mania"" of the 17th century, one of the most well-known speculative bubbles in history. Similar comparisons have been made previously by bank executives — most notably J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that will eventually ""blow up.""

Goldman played down the idea that bitcoin is a ""scarce resource,"" noting that some of the most valuable coins — bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV — are ""forks."" This means the new coins that have been created out of changes in the protocol of the bitcoin network. Bitcoin bulls often claim the digital asset's limited supply is part of what underpins its value and makes it a potential ""hedge"" against currencies which are vulnerable to devaluation in times of economic crisis. The bank also called cryptocurrencies a ""conduit for illicit activity,"" highlighting their use in fraudulent schemes and money laundering. ""It's important to note that Goldman Sachs' competitors Fidelity and JP Morgan have made significant investments in cryptocurrency,"" said Dave Hodgson, chief investment officer and managing director of NEM Ventures, a cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm. Fidelity last year set up a separate unit devoted to cryptocurrency clearing and custody, while J.P. Morgan developed its own internal digital currency, ""JPM Coin,"" for payments. ""While volatility is indeed high, the year-on-year, and now decade-long performance is a consistent uptrend based on holding the asset, not trading the volatility. By considering it unviable for its investors, Goldman Sachs has risked causing its investors to miss out on one of the best performing asset classes in the past 100 years, never mind the last 10."""
2020-06-15 22:06:19+00:00	What Is Ampleforth? How AMPL Is Redefining Decentralized Money	['Ashwath Balakrishnan']	"Key Takeaways Ampleforth (AMPL) is a cryptocurrency protocol with an elastic supply that can expand and contract based on market demand.

The protocol's unique token dynamics make it a promising form of collateral for DeFi.

AMPL is not entirely a stablecoin because it doesn’t eliminate volatility—its protocol aims to reduce volatility.

Ampleforth describes itself as “adaptive money built on sound economics,” aiming to combine the scarcity of Bitcoin with the elasticity of fiat.

Share this article URL Copied

Ampleforth is a cryptocurrency attempting to reinvent money. The protocol’s native token, AMPL, is designed to be used as collateral for decentralized banking systems and as an alternative base-money for the crypto-economy. AMPL operates as an ERC-20 token on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

The Ampleforth protocol’s implementation of “countercyclical” economic policy sets it apart from other DeFi protocols. Simply put, this means if the demand for AMPL increases, the supply of the tokens also increases to offset changes in price. This countercyclical nature is desirable from an investment perspective, as it gives AMPL a low correlation to the likes of BTC and ETH.

A system like this is optimal in establishing a stable price medium of exchange over long time frames. Ampleforth’s goal is to bring back commodity money without the hard limitations imposed by commodities with capped supply and issuance, like BTC and gold.

Unique Token Dynamics

What makes AMPL unique next to other crypto primitives is the demand-supply mechanics of the token. A primitive is a base for building a complex system. Bitcoin is the base primitive for a censorship-resistant payment rail; Ethereum took that primitive on step further by allowing smart contracts to run over the network.

In economics, equilibrium is defined as a state where demand and supply in a market find the perfect balance with each other. For Ampleforth, equilibrium is a state when a change in demand results in a one-for-one change in supply.

For example, if there are 100,000 AMPLs and price increases from $1 to $2 as a result of explosive market demand, then the network will set its target price at $1 and expand supply by 100,000 AMPL. The supply would increase from 100,000 AMPLs to 200,000 AMPLs in a process known as a rebase.

Rebases do not dilute existing token holders. Think of it as owning a fixed percentage of the network rather than a fixed amount of tokens. Further, it is executed in a decentralized manner using the unique capabilities of ERC-20 tokens.

Thus, without Ampleforth stealing market share from any token holders, these 300,000 AMPLs that were just created by the protocol will be credited proportionally to existing addresses holding AMPL. Equilibrium is achieved when the 2x increase in supply is met by a 2x decrease in price, keeping the market capitalization stable at $200,000, as per this example:

Ampleforth builds in a financial incentive for users to help the network reach equilibrium. The network depends on profit-seeking traders to restore equilibrium on the demand side once the change in supply goes through. As an asset whose price is determined by the free market, arbitrageurs can sell their newly credited AMPLs for $2, creating market pressure and bringing AMPL’s price back to equilibrium at $1.

But AMPLs price targeting should not be confused with the concept of a stablecoin. While stablecoins have pegged prices and aim to eliminate volatility, AMPL simply targets lower volatility than the likes of BTC and ETH using set rules.

For the most part, the protocol enforces adequate incentives to ensure users play according to the rules and establish equilibrium. Putting demand in the hands of the market ensures AMPL price discovery is engineered by the free market, but it also imperils equilibrium until market cap grows.

But as market cap grows and AMPL becomes more liquid, trading activity will rise and traders will fight to settle orders and become the arbitrageurs that help align price with the algorithmically set target.

AMPL’s Use Cases

The core utility of AMPL is to serve as a medium of exchange. Ampleforth can scale supply to meet the demands of billions of users, but it can also contract supply if it’s only serving 1,000 users.

AMPL’s elastic supply movements make it an ideal asset to build a digital economy around. For this reason, it has the ability to become the perfect form of collateral for DeFi. Its countercyclical behavior also makes it a good addition to a crypto portfolio.

But the project has another, broader goal: to provide an independent alternative to central bank money. This is a target for the long-term, as Ampleforth must first gain the trust of the community and prove its utility as a reliable medium of exchange and store of value first.

What’s the Goal of Ampleforth?

In 1944, the face of money changed forever. At a conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the countries that make up the United Nations decided to abolish the gold standard, leading to the introduction of the exchange rate regime in place today.

The U.S. dollar was chosen to become the world’s reserve currency. Under this system, the dollar was pegged to a certain amount of gold, and other currencies were pegged to the dollar. This was done with the goal of economic stability.

The formal implementation of the agreements from the conference marked the beginning of a 25-year process of dismantling gold’s role in the global economy. By 1971, gold was just another commodity.

Pushing gold out of the picture was the primary reason growth continued at a rapid rate. Gold was limited in supply and was unable to scale supply issuance to the pace of growth. It was a poor global reserve currency for this single reason.

Separating gold from money, however, gave governments the power to inflate money supply as and how they saw fit, rather than expanding and contracting it as per market demand.

This is where Ampleforth comes in. AMPL takes the concept of flexible supply from fiat currencies and eliminates the totalitarian control over this supply.

“Volatility for fixed supply assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin result in volatility. Sudden shocks in demand can destabilize ecosystems supported by fixed supply assets. For this reason, sudden shocks in demand can destabilize ecosystems supported by fixed supply assets,” said Ampleforth CEO Evan Kuo. “The greater the complexity of an ecosystem built on fixed supply assets, the greater the risk of cascading failure. AMPL was designed to be the simplest, direct solution to the supply inelasticity problem.”

Think of it as gold that increases and decreases in supply as and how the market dictates. The key aspect of Ampleforth is that the market, not the founders or a government, gets to decide what supply should look like.

Imagine if the world was never taken off the gold standard. Gold’s limited issuance per year would’ve limited growth because its price can only scale so much. Now imagine if gold was a digital commodity whose supply expands in times of high demand and shrinks in times of muted demand. All while using data and sentiment as a yardstick rather than the opinions of experts who make up a “board of directors.” That’s Ampleforth in a nutshell.

Further, by creating an asset whose value counters traditional boom-bust cycles, AMPL can become a crucial addition to cryptocurrency portfolios⁠—and one day, perhaps even global macro portfolios.

Ampleforth Is Still an Experiment

Crypto projects have a grey area in between the bootstrapping phase and achieving product-market fit. While at this juncture, the possibility of failure is high.

Ampleforth is in this phase. It’s a novel idea, but not without a set of trade-offs. The way to exit this grey area and attain product-market fit is for the broader crypto market to accept that it is a primitive that provides users with value and is worthy of sticking around.

The market cap is still below $10 million, making it a high-risk play with an immense payoff in the event that the network achieves its vision.

2020-06-01 11:32:09+00:00	Daily Market News: US futures trade lower and gold climbs as unrest hits cities nationwide	['Valentina Kirilova', 'Leaprate Analyst']	"Adam Vettese, UK Market Analyst at eToro, has provided his daily commentary on traditional and crypto markets for June 1, 2020.

US futures were lower ahead of the first trading day of June, as volatile protests over police brutality rocked cities nationwide at the same time as authorities attempted to manage the reopening of the economy. As of Sunday, cities including Minneapolis, Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle and many others had all been the site of protests, which have included looting, fires and shootings. The civil unrest shows no signs of abating, and tensions have been stoked by social media posts from President Trump, in which he pledged military support for local authorities and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” – a comment that was removed by Twitter for inciting violence.

The violence is hitting investor sentiment, as it is falling in many of the USA’s major economic centres at a crucial time, when authorities are balancing lifting lockdown measures with avoiding a second wave of the pandemic. Investors now face an even more confusing picture: protests complicate reopening plans, while internationally tensions continue to rise between the US and China. On Friday, President Trump accused China of offences, ranging from espionage to ripping off “the United States like no one has ever done before.”

Asian markets presented a ray of hope for investors today amid the chaos – both Japan’s Nikkei and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng surged, despite the ongoing battle between the US and China over the latter’s sovereignty. Gold also climbed as the combination of coronavirus, US/China relations and the events across major American cities pushed up the safe haven to $1,745, its highest level for two weeks.

Value stocks show signs of life

The S&P 500 gained 3% last week, over the four days the market was open, closing out the month with a 4.5% plus gain overall. There were signs of a turning point for value investors in the latter half of the month after a painful 2020 so far, as the Russell 1000 Value Index beat the Russell 1000 Growth Index for the second week in a row. With Q1 earnings season winding down, investors can now toll the damage corporate America has suffered so far at the hands of the economic lockdown. According to investment firm John Hancock, Q1 earnings for S&P 500 companies fell almost 15% versus Q1 2019. In economic data, it was reported on Friday that US consumer spending fell by a record 13.6% in April, although personal income increased 10.5% versus March as stimulus measures kicked into gear. In April, spending on cars was down 30% versus April 2019, while clothing spending fell by half. Consumer spending data will be key to watch in the months to come, as it accounts for some two-thirds of economic growth, according to financial advice firm Edward Jones, which said in a Friday note that “the economic recovery is tightly linked to financially and physically healthy consumers.” Overall, US gross domestic product is expected to shrink by 40% in Q2, versus the same quarter last year.

S&P 500: +0.5% Friday, -5.8% YTD (+3% last week)

Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.1% Friday, -11.1% YTD (+3.8% last week)

Nasdaq Composite: +1.3% Friday, +5.8% YTD (+1.8% last week)

Mid-cap beats large as FTSE 250 jumps 3.9%

Mid cap stocks outpaced their large cap counterparts in the UK this week, with the FTSE 250 jumping by 3.9%, helping it close the lead the FTSE 100 has built up in 2020 so far. The FTSE 250 is now down 22.1% to the FTSE 100’s negative 19.4%. Both indices delivered gains last week despite a heavy selloff on Friday driven by concerns about US-China relations and the implications for global trade, which saw the FTSE 100 tumble 2.3%. London markets closed before President Trump’s Friday press conference on China, after which US stocks stabilised. For the FTSE 100, Friday’s loss was led by double-digit falls from Rolls Royce and cruise firm Carnival, with easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines Group each losing more than 7% apiece too. Rolls Royce stock is now down more than 60% year-to-date, driven by the devastation the pandemic has wreaked on global air travel."
2020-06-01 11:31:45+00:00	Crypto around the world: UK	['Team Luno']	"In our Crypto Around the World series, we take a look at the crypto landscape in different markets around the world, focusing on infrastructure, investment, regulation, and adoption.

This week, we’re shining a spotlight on the UK – a country that has historically led the world in financial innovation. But is this still the case? And is it embracing cryptocurrency to its full potential?

Is London still the FinTech capital of the world?

London has long been heralded as one of the world’s leading FinTech hubs. It’s a hugely attractive base for investors, startups, and larger firms alike, even ranking second in Findexable’s Global Fintech Index City Rankings 2020 Report. Only San Francisco Bay pipped the UK capital to first place. In 2019, there were an estimated 1,600 FinTech firms in the UK, which is expected to more than double by 2030. 76,500 people work in FinTech across the UK.

This is due to a number of factors. Chief among them is its progressive approach to regulation. A recent Deloitte report cited the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as a pioneering regulatory body, citing a number of initiatives that foster FinTech collaboration within their hubs. These include FinTech offices, accelerator programs, international agreements and sandbox environments where FinTech and financial institutions can “test” innovations in a safe production environment.

For example, the FCA has launched a program named Innovate, through which firms can apply for support and guidance relative to initiatives mentioned above. In a report detailing Innovate’s impact and effectiveness, the FCA cites a number of firms who’ve received support and how it helped them. These include Cuvva, a mobile app offering flexible insurance options, Blink, a flight insurance product, and Nivaura, the first company to execute a tokenised security issuance in the sandbox.

The UK has particularly benefited from a first-mover advantage in the creation of a regulatory sandbox to support FinTechs. Their model is now being implemented across the globe, which means they’ll need to continue their work on regulatory reform in order to retain their lead in FinTech growth. Since 2013, the FCA’s innovation hub has provided support to over 500 businesses, and since 2016 almost 100 firms have tested products in the FCA sandbox.

The question now is, does this forward-thinking approach to FinTech extend to crypto?

Crypto adoption in the UK

According to research Luno carried out in Q1 and Q2 of 2019, around 20% of the UK population owns cryptocurrency and this number is growing fast. This is roughly in line with the rest of Europe, which sits at an average of 24.75%.

However, there is huge potential for growth and it’s clear that customer desire is there to use crypto both as a form of payment and instance. In the survey, 67% of UK buyers said they bought crypto as an investment in Q2 of 2019 – a significant increase on the 55% people in the Q1 survey. Additionally, 37% of individuals in the UK said they would like to use cryptocurrencies to pay for things in stores and online.

This is partly because, as Matt Leibowitz, Founder and CEO of Stake, puts it: “UK customers are savvy and expect top quality financial service products.” Vilve Vene, co-founder and CEO of Modularbank shares this belief, based upon research conducted on the UK’s financial space which indicates more than 90% of UK consumers claim a strong technology offering is important to them when choosing who to bank with.

Interestingly, the report also indicates that customers hold technological applications in higher stead than interest rates when it comes to choosing a banking partner.

(Source: Modularbank’s Seamless banking, seamless payments: Making every business a fintech business report, March 2020)

The high-level of comfort with innovative approaches to payments and FinTech can be seen throughout commerce, suggesting fertile ground for crypto. According to a Statista dossier, “The United Kingdom has the most advanced e-commerce market in Europe.” And it’s constantly growing. The most recent figures from the Office of National Statistics (UK) indicated the country’s e-commerce revenue in 2018 came to £688.4 billion, a sharp increase on the year before.

(Above: E-commerce sales in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2014 – 2018, Statista)

The graph below indicates this growth is only set to rise in the years to come.

(Above: Value of online retail sales in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2012 to 2019 (in billion GBP), Statista)

The dossier continues, “[In Great Britain], the share of smartphone users who shopped via mobile devices, especially smartphones, increased over the years. In parallel, the number of consumers who used mobile payment methods in their online transactions increased, with an expected growth of more than two million more users in 2019.”

It’s clear UK consumers are familiar and comfortable with making online purchases, and are accustomed to using their money digitally. And retailers are responding en masse. For example, at the beginning of April, over 100 car dealers in the country are gearing up to accept crypto payments for car purchases. Luke Wilmott, commercial director at AutoCoinCars explained the logic: “With five million people in the UK already using cryptocurrency, we can see that it’s definitely the way of the future. It all started with Bitcoin, and now there are several other currencies available. […] For dealers, offering cryptocurrency as a purchasing option to your customers opens up another great avenue of business.”

We can expect that as more people demand frictionless operability in the payments sector and become accustomed to interacting with money digitally, mass adoption of crypto as a means to service these demands will increase.

A digital pound?

Countries around the world are looking at central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and the UK is no exception. The Bank of England has examined how Britain could adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to keep up with innovation in the FinTech space. Facebook’s Libra stablecoin project also likely accelerated the central bank’s motivations.

Put simply, CBDCs are a digital form of government-backed and issued currency. Cryptocurrencies and other virtual currencies are not issued by a state or government and as such they are not financially backed by them. Essentially, governments haven’t (yet) classified them as legal tender that you could use as you would your local currency. CBDCs would be legal tender.

A CBDC system would generally be implemented through a centralised database that’s managed by a government or central bank. In some cases, countries could even opt to make use of private-sector companies to manage their data. It is likely that they will use blockchain technology, in the same way that traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do. However, unlike cryptocurrencies, which are decentralised, monetary control would remain within the government.

The Bank of England published a discussion paper on CBDCs in March this year. In it, the Bank details the motivations behind creating a CBDC, how the decline in the use of cash and new payment trends are shaping the industry, opportunities for the Bank’s objectives, the design process attached to creating a CBDC, and what technology a CBDC would require.

Keeping up with crypto regulations

The creation of the UK Cryptoassets Taskforce was announced in March 2018 by the Chancellor of Exchequer as part of the government’s FinTech Sector Strategy. The Taskforce is made up of the HM Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England. As is expected due to the nature of the industry, the guidelines set out by the Taskforce are under constant revision. UK policy thinking regarding cryptocurrencies was set out by the Taskforce in its CryptoAssets Taskforce: Final Report, published in October 2018.

The Taskforce Report recognises cryptocurrencies as a subset of the broader category “cryptoasset”. This is defined as “a cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights that uses some type of [distributed ledger technology] and can be transferred, stored, or traded electronically”. Within this category, the Taskforce Report identifies three sub-categories with the following non-legislative definitions:

1. Exchange tokens: are referred to as “cryptocurrencies”, like Bitcoin. They utilise a [distributed ledger technology] platform and are not issued or backed by a central bank or any other central body. They are used as a means of exchange or for investment and do not provide the types of rights or access provided by security or utility tokens.

2. Security tokens: amount to a “specified investment” as set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act (2000) (Regulated Activities). These may provide rights such as ownership, repayment of a specific sum of money, or entitlement to a share in future profits. They may also be transferable securities or financial instruments under the EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II.

3. Utility tokens: can be redeemed for access to a specific product or service that is typically provided using a [distributed ledger technology] platform.

Importantly, UK financial regulators have issued warnings in relation to investment in cryptoassets but they are not subject to a blanket prohibition or ban in the UK. However, some will be subject to financial regulation – a comprehensive breakdown of these can be found in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Regulation 2020 for the United Kingdom. According to the report, cryptoassets (including cryptocurrencies) are not considered money or equivalent to fiat currency in the UK.

The 2020 regulation also indicates the UK does not have a bespoke financial regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies and advises that whether or not a given cryptocurrency is subject to financial regulation in the UK is dependent on whether it falls within the general financial regulatory perimeter established under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). Additionally, they may fall under the payments services and electronic money regime established under the Payment Services Regulation 2017 (PSRs) and the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (EMRs).

Currently, there are no bespoke tax rules applicable to cryptocurrencies. As such, existing tax principles and rules apply, despite the uncertainty around their application, more so in relation to business and corporate tax. The government published a policy paper on cryptoassets and tax for individuals which was last updated in December 2019.

UK crypto firms, startups and influencers

According to The Next Web, funding into cryptocurrency and blockchain startups in the UK reached a new record in 2018. Data published by Pitchbook and London & Partners, firms in the space raised more than £200m from venture capital investors. Conversely, startups in the actor only received £19.11m in 2017 and £51.96m in 2016.

The article continues to mention that: “Additionally, the data shows that technology businesses based in London are still enjoying access to almost double the amount of growth capital available to their counterparts in other European cities such as Berlin (£936.53M), Paris (£797.04M) and Stockholm (£224.23M).”

Sonovate lists the top 10 funded UK crypto companies are as follows:

1. Blockchain

2. SETL

3. Bitstamp

4. Hive Project

5. Elliptic

6. Humaniq

7. Seratio

8. Wirexapp

9. SatoshiPay

10. Senit

UK’s influential players

The UK FinTech State of the Nation report acknowledges that FinTech “thrives where capital, tech and talent connect with regulations and government.” In the UK, from an increasing demand for financial technology innovation, favourable regulations and governmental assistance, to a strong talent pool, it’s understandable that influential members in the crypto and FinTech space chose the UK as their home base.

These include Dr Adam Back, a self-proclaimed cypherpunk and renowned British cryptographer. He is also the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, a company with a mission to further the development of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. He invented Hashcash, a proof-of-work system used by several anti-spam systems. He has extensive experience in cryptography protocols, Bitcoin, electronic cash and privacy-enhanced technology, among a host of other related subjects. He has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Exeter. He is also not Satoshi Nakamoto, despite the rumours.

Andreas M. Antonopoulos is another worth watching out for. The Greek-British best-selling author, speaker, educator, and highly-sought-after expert in Bitcoin and open blockchain technologies. He is known for making complex subjects easy to understand and highlighting both the positive and negative impacts these technologies can have on our global societies. As an educator, his mission is to educate as many people as possible, in as many places as possible, in as many languages as possible, about Bitcoin and open blockchains.

Luno’s view on the regulation of cryptocurrency

Crypto in 2020: The year so far

A beginner’s guide to crypto market analysis"
2020-06-16 12:17:47+00:00	Digital Marketing in the cryptocurrency world	['Zoran Živković', 'Branislav Čerubdžić']	"What are cryptocurrencies?

The cryptocurrency market is a distributed ecosystem based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) network technology. Decentralization is a defining trait of this system, and it’s a reflection of the fact that there is no central bank or other instance that enforces control over the network. The transactions are conducted and verified via a distributed Blockchain framework that depends on resources of users, who are called miners. They make the processing power of their computers available to the network, which then solves complex mathematical problems (SHA 256 Algorithm). In return, miners receive a reward in a particular cryptocurrency. This kind of necessary arrangement is a revolutionary solution that gave rise to the wave of financial innovation and disruption.

Since their inception, cryptocurrencies have remained exclusively digital in nature. They have no physical form and aren’t linked to any conventional standard, such as gold. However, over time, they have moved far away from their founding ideology, which confined them to the fringes of the financial realm. The evolution has ushered in a new era in which cryptocurrencies would establish themselves as a fully-fledged market. It’s quite interesting that even major countries plan to roll in their digital coins to get back the control they lost to decentralized markets. These national solutions will differ from traditional cryptocurrencies but are poised to operate on similar principles. Among the countries going down this path are China, the USA, Russia, Turkey, Sweden, etc. In the years to come, more nations are likely to join their ranks.

Speaking of the future of cryptocurrencies, we believe that it will be closely tied to DeFi projects, which is to say decentralized finances. The goal of DeFi is to automate current financial processes related to loans, savings, trade, insurance, etc. More and more emerging cryptocurrencies are gravitating toward this DeFi market, which should expand on some promises that pioneers like Bitcoin made to the consumers. Most notably, DeFi is expected to make money, financial services, and transactions much more accessible to people around the globe. They will be able to engage with DeFi via the internet and smartphones.

Another solution poised to boom comes in the form of smart contracts. They are very similar to regular contracts, the difference being the automated process of authentication, which plays out over a blockchain, as a direct, self-executing agreement between two parties. They are written in code language named Solidity and offer a high level of security— the contracts can’t be forged, falsified, or tampered with in any other way. The second benefit is the superior speed of contract processing.

So, it’s no wonder some prominent cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, utilize smart contract mechanisms. Also, large corporations, such as the streaming giant Inmusik and diamond company Tracr, have adopted smart contracts to revamp their supply chains and revenue streams. That way, they aim to solve two burning issues— the lack of ownership and transparency. Smart contracts have also made an impact in the legal, real estate, logistics, shipping, and banking industries.

What does the future hold for bitcoin and other coins?

It’s tricky to predict the future value of cryptocurrencies, but taking a look at the history, it’s obvious the market is prone to both positive and negative cycles. Their interchange takes place every one to four years on average. Many cryptocurrencies have even completely disappeared from the scene. Therefore, it makes much sense to focus on underlying technologies and systems such as blockchain, DeFi, and smart contracts. They are, undoubtedly, the future of money and the financial sector as we know it.

That said, we should also point out cryptocurrencies, despite high volatility, are quite resilient. Take the example of the first cryptocurrency to emerge, the Bitcoin. Not only has it survived to this date but it recorded astounding growth over the years. Believe it or not, in 2010, the first Bitcoin transaction was 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas. This inception moment, May 22, became known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. Today (12th June 2020), however, only one Bitcoin goes for $9,435. And make no mistake; this crypto paragon has evolved way past shady corridors of Darknet. Nowadays, we have examples of it being used in influencer marketing by startups in the league of indaHash. This company announced it would pay social media influencers through a blockchain cryptocurrency resembling Bitcoin.

On top of that, we should point out that blockchain has permeated digital marketing in a big way. Take the example of the famous KFC, which decided to launch a pilot project with the purpose of applying blockchain to online advertising and media buying. One of the main objectives of the project is to refine the supply chain and make it more transparent. Applications like this one will clear the way for other cryptocurrencies to enter the mainstream.

Many of them are already big business, and they are here to stay.

The state of crypto marketing

The rise in popularity of Bitcoin and Blockchain may have brought forward a slew of new cryptocurrencies, but these solutions have to be promoted in order to stay afloat. The way to do this was marketing, or to be more precise, the advertising via Facebook Ads and Google Ads. The tactic worked for a while; however, a seismic shift occurred in 2018, when Facebook and Google banned ads that promote cryptocurrencies. The high unpredictability of financial products justified this move. Namely, the two digital gains saw the crypto market as “unregulated” and “speculative”. This was a blow to cryptocurrencies, but far from a lethal one.

Let’s examine why this is taking a long way around.

Developing the strategy of digital communication for our client, the ECD.rs platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies in Serbia, Macedonia, and Montenegro, we had a chance to research industry trends. We got familiar with the specific conditions of the industry and the marketing that goes on in it. What is more, during content creation for their digital channels, which was done in accordance with the established strategy, we had an opportunity to learn more about the ins and outs of the sector, as well as the characteristics of the target group— cryptocurrency users.

For many of them, the main problem is that cryptocurrencies don’t have a physical shape— they can’t be seen or touched. From this immaterial quality stems poor awareness and knowledge of how the system functions and these are the obstacles that digital marketing has to face. This is to say that we have to educate consumers first and teach them how to buy, handle, and save in cryptocurrencies. Then, we can entice them to actually purchase something via virtual money.

Another challenge to be aware of is the unavailability of data. With regular (credit card or PayPal) transactions, companies can leverage payment track records for valuable data. Conversely, cryptocurrency exchanges leave no such trace. They give all the power and privacy to consumers, hiding the history of transactions from public view. You can’t get information from intermediary stakeholders because there are none to speak of.

Overcoming the hurdles

Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have become much more than a shady payment mechanism. Bitcoin heavily relies on marketing— it’s just not the type of marketing we’re used to. Due to its decentralized configuration, the crypto king doesn’t own any channels and has to count on word of mouth (earned media) exclusively. This reminds us that digital marketing hinges on many different tactics, not just advertising.

Hence, we have to realize the main tools for crypto marketing are channels and media assets that users create themselves: blogs, podcasts, and tutorials. Word of mouth plays a vital role as well, which involves referrals people give to people in their social circles. We would underline the importance of forums like Reddit as well, where cryptocurrency news and discussions enjoy high popularity around the clock. The same goes for chat groups on the Telegram forum, Medium, etc. These are hubs where cryptocurrency users dissect topics, share information, and voice their opinions regarding the goings-on in the crypto landscape.

One of the chief social networks people use to talk about events in the crypto world is Twitter. In some cases, even the content that promotes cryptocurrencies is allowed. Just behind Twitter is Facebook, which is an excellent channel for distributing interesting, educative, and entertaining information.

When talking about marketing in the crypto field, we also have to highlight the place traditional media have. They form public opinion and shape consumer trust in cryptocurrencies, profoundly influencing the market growth. For years now, we’ve had media outlets specializing in the crypto industry, such as Cointelegraph and Coindesk. The Forbes Magazine has a special segment on cryptocurrencies, which is linked to the separate Twitter account. They all approach crypto affairs from an analytical, comprehensive perspective, always keeping up with what’s current.

On the other hand, mainstream media view cryptocurrencies from the Bitcoin-first perspective, covering mostly wild ups and downs in the price of this cryptocurrency. Such an approach tends to be sensationalistic and mystifies the whole industry. A major problem here is a low degree of knowledge of the sector on the part of media workers.

Of course, the coverage varies from state to state. In some of them, mainstream media is the only source of information on cryptocurrencies. In others, the sources are more diverse and specialize in the crypto market. Furthermore, certain states frown upon crypto transactions or declare them illegal. On the opposite side of the spectrum are the countries that have essentially made cryptocurrencies equal to fiat money. A French Court, for example, has ruled that Bitcoin is money after all. Such legal precedents will accelerate the growth of crypto markets and remind us that the outlook of states on cryptocurrencies isn’t set in stone— it’s changing around the globe.

Means of reaching the target audience

People around the world exhibit unequal levels of knowledge about the crypto industry. Some are active and eager users, enthusiasts with in-depth insights and developed trust. Channels we can use to reach them are the aforementioned forums, Twitter, but also influencers who are relevant for the industry and the world of technology in general. To name a few, some of the most prominent crypto influencers on social media of today are Vitalik Buterin, Naval Ravikant, Michael Terpin, and the Winklevoss Twins.

Still, most people don’t possess in-depth knowledge about the industry, which means the educational content is crucial for them. What is more, the most suitable channels of communication are social media, Facebook being first and foremost. We should also mention conventional media channels that can be used to raise general awareness and educate potential users.

Viable marketing tactics

A conclusion to draw from all of this is that the main challenge marketing faces with the crypto realm is developing content that is aligned with the varying levels of knowledge people have. One has to find a way to rally them around crypto topics, build a community, and deploy the right content on a regular basis. This content must deliver expert market analysis and actualities from the crypto world. It should stir discussions on forums and lead to the collaboration with the relevant influencers. Engaged users are of paramount business importance because they can act as brand ambassadors and spread the word around. As we mentioned earlier, mouth-to-mouth marketing holds the key to successful promotion in the sector.

And for people who are yet to make their first steps in the crypto world, we need to emphasize the educative aspect of the content. This is to say we should publish blog posts, tutorials, explainer videos, and interesting information. It would be a good idea to provide tips on trends and things people can purchase via cryptocurrencies. It’s worth explaining what other ways of using cryptocurrencies are as well. Finally, native content pieces and articles published in other media are integral to achieving organic search visibility, but also spreading awareness and about cryptocurrencies and the industry in general.

2020-06-05 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin Bulls and Bears Face off at $10,000	[]	"Summary

Bitcoin (BTC) briefly ramped above the $10,000 level this week before getting slammed back down.

Friction between the U.S and China and protests in the United States drove the news cycle.

Bitcoin resistance lies at the psychologically important $10,000 level while support can be found at the lows of the week at $9,200.

Market Trends This Week

Bitcoin (BTC) finished the week higher by around three percent. The weekly move in BTC does not tell the full story, however. Prices launched higher by 7% in less than an hour on Tuesday as BTC regained the closely watched $10,000 level. BTC then consolidated for a bit on Wednesday and then plummeted by more than 7% in under an hour to surrender the gains. By the end of the week, prices grinded their way up around 3%.

BTC Hourly Chart Shows Short-Term Spike and Reversal

Altcoins, which have been stagnant for months have seen renewed demand. Ethereum (ETH) showed the most strength in the space. ETH rose 10% on the week. Last month volatility contracted and formed an inside month. This month’s price rose above the highs, clearing three months of action. Bulls have taken back control. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose strongly and gained 8% as it attempts to take out last months inside month highs.

ETH Monthly Shown: Clears Inside Month and 3 Months Worth of Highs

Investors are keeping a close eye on the outcome of the protests in the U.S as well as any escalation in terms of trade between the U.S and China. While the news on these topics has been non-stop, global financial markets have seen little impact thus far and have continued to grind higher.

This Week’s Topics

Crypto asset exchange Gemini has partnered with Samsung to create a blockchain wallet.

Maerki Bauann, a private Swiss bank, has launched a crypto trading service for institutional investors.

Next Week’s Market Forecast

Bitcoin (BTC) has now cleared and held above a trendline on the daily chart going back a year. While the bulls have taken the upper hand in that department, bears have been able to hold the price below the $10,000 level on a closing basis. Price movements have been tamed over the last few weeks as the Bitcoin halving has been digested by investors.

BTC Clears Daily Trendline and is Now Battling $10,000

Volatility is now picking up though as bulls and bears battle over the psychologically important $10,000 zone. Milestone numbers can lead to big upswings in volatility. In February, BTC poked its head above $10,000 briefly before seeing a quick haircut of more than 50% in the next four weeks. This time around BTC has not been able to overtake the $10,000 level but also has not dropped.

Bulls want to see BTC regain $10,000 and hold while bears want to see this week’s lows of $9,200 and the trendline support below taken out."
2020-06-14 18:30:23+00:00	Impact of Blockchain in Marketing and Advertising in 2020	['Toshendra Kumar Sharma']	"Blockchain, in marketing, which was considered hype mostly, is now going mainstream—brands like Unilever, Nestle. McDonald’s, and Virgin Media have signed up for blockchain to improve transparency in digital marketing. The initiative would unlock data inefficiency, fraud, and trust issues, making it the tip of the iceberg. In 2020, there are many ways in which blockchain can benefit marketing based on surveys on future directions and industry standing in 2019.

There are several questions in the mind of newcomers or even blockchain professionals when it comes to the effect of this revolutionary technology on marketing and advertising. We, in collaboration with a blockchain expert, try to answer all these questions.

Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain in Advertising

How blockchain affects marketing?

Exciting Blockchain Marketing Startups

Conclusion

The number of blockchain companies in marketing has grown 13 times in the last one and a half years, and we believe this positive streak would continue in 2020, and in this blog, we prove why!

Introduction to Blockchain

In layman terms, blockchain is a decentralized database, i.e., not controlled by a single central unit but by a group of users. The data contained in the system is encrypted. It cannot be deleted or modified. Any file or data can be stored in chain blocks according to the blockchain theory. The technology finds use in many domains. In the blockchain system business transactions, financial information and health records are permanent and stay unchanged. Thus, blockchain is a new, transparent, and secure tool for industries such as advertising. You can check out an online blockchain course before reading about blockchain in advertising and marketing.

Blockchain in Advertising

Like the Internet three decades ago, and social media in the last decade- blockchain is a foundational technology that can disrupt the marketing landscape. It is based on distributed ledger technology, which has massive potential to touch different points of the marketing value chain. Smart contracts between agencies and brands and micro-payments that incentivize customer interactions have the potential to revolutionize marketing. There are about 219 companies that allow leveraging blockchain in marketing campaigns. Everyone involved in startups or innovative businesses need advertising. Sometimes, the feedback doesn’t match the expectations or, in some cases, result in a scam. So can blockchain make a difference? Let’s find out!

How Blockchain Affects Marketing?

In 2020, blockchain is a panacea for all of the advertising worries. The ideas that were mere theory are being replaced with valid and tried solutions solving transparency, efficiency, and tackling fraud. Identity-solving applications are becoming more real. Here we list down what all blockchain has to offer to the industry:

1. A Way to Share Rewards

The distributed ledger technology automates payments at any scale, making it possible for brands to send micro-amounts to the consumers. This has massive implications as it is used to transfer money directly into bank accounts, replacing gift cards and online credit with limited redemption possibilities. This lets customers have a monetary incentive, no matter how small the interaction is.

2. Optimized Advertising Value Chain

One of the focus areas for blockchain in marketing is Adtech. Managing digital ads is a prime candidate for moving to a secure, transparent, and accountable distributed ledger.

3. Verifies Data For Customer Intelligence

Blockchain can gather, check, store, and automatically update databases with a little human intervention. This is believed to transform the customer insights’ approach. Blockchain is the perfect underlying platform to generate ideas because it prioritizes data-driven marketing.

4. Targeted Content Delivery

Data can be linked to a hyper-personalized segment of insight generation rather than using automated insight generation for effective targeting.

5. Serverless Architecture

Serverless architecture is a better option than traditional cloud hosting to deal with thousands of transactions as it allows stores to scale as per customer demand. Blockchain directly enables brands to gain from zero performance gaps and indirectly by going serverless as it will enable them to host on-demand campaigns.

6. Transparency and Trust

Blockchain helps advertisers select the right publishers, quantify the results of an advertising campaign, helps build trust, and prevent fraud. This reduces cost and speeds up transactions. Consumers are aware of the entire process before the distribution of goods is visible.

Exciting Blockchain Marketing Startups

RadPay, a payment and rewards startup, hopes to make blockchain mainstream in 2020. It has a broad spectrum of marketing applications, including cart abandonment reduction, revenue generation, and borderless business.

The firm says the fourth-largest cryptocurrency is at the top of their radar after it printed major upticks in its social metrics.

“XRP has entered the top spot on Santimentfeed’s Emerging Trends and has seen massive social volume spikes.

These are potential indicators of an upcoming decoupling from BTC, so keep an eye on Ripple’s upside since these spikes aren’t pump-related yet.”

However, two widely-followed technical traders are not on the same page, and believe the extended bear market of the XRP/BTC pair market is far from over. Trader Cheds tells his 78,000 Twitter followers that XRP/BTC is forming a bearish pattern that sets the stage for another leg down.

Crypto analyst Ethereum Jack seconds Ched’s bearish tone. The trader says unless XRP/BTC shows signs of life, it is poised to lose half of its value.

“I will trade XRP vs BTC when it shows strength. Any weekly close above green and I’m interested.

Until then who knows what can happen, currently down 91% since ATH but has seen 95% drops before, which is close to another 50% dropdown. Move slow.”

Meanwhile, Florent Maulin, a researcher at the crypto metrics platform Messari, says XRP’s inflation rate may be tied to its poor performance over the past year-and-a-half. He says the coin’s rate of inflation is currently among highest of the large-cap coins.

“XRP circulating supply inflation rate (20%) is the highest among large-cap assets over the past year, 5 times higher than BTC pre-halving.

Only 30% of XRP max supply has been distributed, vs 87.5% for BTC. BTC is up 20% since last year, XRP is down 47%.”"

Currently Link is trading at $4.39 with a MOM growth of ~16%.

Chainlink [LINK] Could Trade At $20

Weiss Crypto rating one of the pioneers in crypto assets and stocks rating today via twitter marked Chainlink [LINK] out of all 2,647 cryptocurrency listed on coinMarketCap for its real world use cases. The crypto rating firm also recognized Chainlink as an potential market leader in thriving smart contract blockchain market.

Of the 2,647 cryptocurrencies listed by CoinMarketCap, only a few have real-world use cases. And of those, almost none is as well-positioned to cash in on the burgeoning growth of smart contracts as #Chainlink (LINK).https://t.co/faVwoXNnNG — Weiss Crypto Ratings (@WeissCrypto) June 10, 2020

As per the detailed blog published at the main website of Weiss Crypto rating the chainlink project already has robust and growing adoption of real world users. The blog emphasizes the upcoming rise in demand for smart contract related technologies which will put Chainlink in drivers seat.

Another important point mentioned in the blog was that companies like Google are already using Chainlink to link data in their monster database [bigQuery] to blockchain applications worldwide. Chainlink may also provide real world data to Oracle’s upcoming smart contract enabled blockchains.

The team predicted Link is currently undervalued and Link prices may rise as high as 5x of current market price.

Taking all of the forgoing into account, we reckon LINK could trade as high as $20. Which is almost five times what it trades for today. Investors would be smart to keep LINK on their radar.

Do you agree with Weiss Crypto Ratings analysis of Link, let us know in your comments."

He Believes In The Future Of Digital Currency', 'Enjoys Updating The Public With Breaking News On New Developments In The Cryptocurrency Space.', 'Contact', 'Adrian.Klent', 'At']	"Advertisement

Despite Bitcoin’s struggling price movement since the year began and even after the halving events, new reports have continued to prove that Cryptocurrency investors, precisely Bitcoin investors, have remained bullish as investment continues to increase in leaps and bounds.

The most recent is reflected in new reports, showing that leading Bitcoin trust firm Grayscale, has secured over 9500 BTC in the past one week. This brings the overall figure the firm has secured from investors since the Bitcoin halving (past 3 weeks) to a sum total of 28,413 BTC, an equivalent of $279,118,407 when converted to Bitcoin’s current trading price.

Another massive week for Grayscale.

In contrast, there has been a slower production rate from Bitcoin miners since the halving occurred. The reports have shown that miners have only been able to come down with a total of $6,863 mined BTC over a space of 7 days. When combined with the number of Bitcoins mined throughout post-halving, the figures are estimated at a total of $19,200 BTC, approximately $188,677,440.

New money is coming to Crypto

In the first quarter of 2020, Grayscale recorded an average weekly investment of $29.9 million. While in 2019, Grayscale was only able to secure $3.2 million in the first quarter of that year.

Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust is on a whole new level in 2020.

The influx of funds being poured into Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust goes to show that whales and big players in the Cryptocurrency scenes are optimistic about a promising future for Bitcoin. This optimism becomes even more objective when the highly anticipated post-halving upsurge in Bitcoin’s price is considered.

Meanwhile, a new wave of investors is certainly trailing the Cryptocurrency scenes. This should come as no surprise, seeing the United States is already experiencing an economical crisis as a result of the global Covid-19 pandemic, as with many other countries.

Due to the increased inflation rate and the impressive performance of Bitcoin against other leading assets including gold, it is evident that a lot of investors are following billionaire Tudor’s footsteps, and are looking into Cryptocurrency as a better investment alternative.

Mining Difficulty Drops

The last Bitcoin halving event led to the reduction of Bitcoin mining rewards from 12.5 bitcoin (BTC) per block to 6.25 units. While this led to an exit from Bitcoin miners who couldn’t afford stronger equipment, mining difficulty has now been adjusted to 13.7 trillion on the Bitcoin Blockchain network.

This means that miners will find it a lot easier to mine Bitcoin. Despite the reduced rate at which miners are currently carrying out production, which can be credited to exorbitant mining equipment, and reduced rewards, the reset in mining difficulty will certainly work in favor of miners.

Bitcoin Price Performance

Asides from mild weekly losses, Bitcoin price has not particularly experienced a severe downswing. Still, price-performance has still not been the most encouraging as Bitcoin continues to retest previous support.

Although Bitcoin experienced a short rally and crossed over $10,000 on the second of June, Bitcoin is now trading at a previous support price of $9,792.67. If the bulls can find stability in the coming weeks, Bitcoin could peak at $10,000 and progress to break higher resistance levels."
