2020-02-25 10:05:26+00:00	Crypto market sees extensive bloodbath as Bitcoin reaches key level	['Cole Petersen', 'Chainwire', 'News Desk', 'Samuel Wan', 'Andjela Radmilac', 'Joseph Young', 'Ali Martinez']	"After a futile attempt to kick off another uptrend yesterday, the crypto market has seen an intense selloff that has stemmed from Bitcoin’s move down to $9,500, which has subsequently led most major altcoins to plummet lower.

This bloodbath has led most major cryptocurrencies to form an incredibly close correlation to Bitcoin, and it is highly probable that where the aggregated market heads next will be dependent on whether or not BTC is able to hold above a key level that it is currently trading at.

If the benchmark crypto breaks below this level, it could spark a market-wide selloff that leads many major altcoins to invalidate the bullish market structures they have formed over the past several weeks.

Crypto market sees intense selloff following Bitcoin’s bearish rejection

Yesterday, Bitcoin attempted to make a move up to $10,000 that was met with significant selling pressure, subsequently leading BTC to plummet towards $9,500.

This rejection sent shockwaves throughout the aggregated crypto market, with many altcoins that were previously expressing bullishness to see notable selloffs.

At the time of writing, Tezos and Chainlink – two of the best performing altcoins in 2020–are leading today’s drop, trading down 8 percent and 7.5 percent respectively.

Most other altcoins are closely trailing these losses, with Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, and others all trading down roughly 6 percent.

The only major cryptocurrency that has been able to dodge losses of this magnitude is Ethereum, which is trading down just under 3 percent.

Where altcoins go next depends on how Bitcoin reacts to one key level

Today’s selloff has led Bitcoin to a key support level at $9,550 that bulls are currently attempting to defend, and a drop below this level could open the gates for significantly further near-term losses.

Big Chonis, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, spoke about this key level in a recent tweet, referencing the level seen on the below chart.

“Very important area that Bitcoin bulls want to hold…Has acted as support to resistance and back to support… weekly!”

In the near-term, how deep the ongoing altcoin selloff extends will likely rest largely on whether BTC is able to further extend its upwards momentum, as a failure to do so will likely lead investors to flee their altcoin positions in favor of BTC."
2020-02-22 10:35:25+00:00	Can the Total Crypto Market Cap Hit $10 trillion by 2023?	[]	"Popular YouTube crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, has been considering the logarithmic regression band for the total cryptocurrency market cap in his latest video, and based on his analysis, thinks that the total digital asset market cap could hit $10 trillion during the next bull run.

What’s A Logarithmic Regression Band?

While it may sound like AI-generated musicians for psychotherapists to relax to, the logarithmic regression band is actually the range of values to which the crypto market tends to fall back when it is not in a bubble. It is represented by the green band on the chart below.

The line forms a smooth curve overtime when plotted against a logarithmic value scale. At the peak of the 2017-2018 bubble/burst cycle, the total crypto market cap came very close to $1 trillion. However, it has since fallen back to the regression band and currently stands at around $290 billion.

Diminishing Returns Each Crypto Market Cycle

Plotting the difference between the total market cap and the lowest point of the regression band over time shows that the peak levels are becoming lower with each market cycle. This supports the theory of diminishing returns over time.

Assuming this behavior continues, we can project a potential peak level above the regression band for the next major bull run. As an example, Cowen projects this happening in 2022, but of course, it could be earlier or later than this, if it happens at all.

The potential outcome of this would be a total cryptocurrency market cap of around $10 trillion at the peak of the next bubble. In this scenario market cap is likely to oscillate within the regression band for a while before starting its climb.

But What About $100 Trillion Bitcoin?

Ah yes, according to PlanB’s stock to flow (S2F) model, the Bitcoin market cap alone is projected to go to $100 trillion. Cowen’s $10 Trillion market cap peak for the entire crypto market doesn’t sound so impressive against that prediction.

Of course, the $100 trillion Bitcoin is still some way off in the future. The projected price increases in the S2F model happen because of the artificial limiting of supply over time. The next halving will happen in May this year.

However, the $100 trillion projection isn’t due until another two halvings after that, or sometime in 2028. So, for now, a $10 trillion market cap by 2022 will have to do.

At current Bitcoin dominance levels, a $10 trillion total crypto market cap gives a BTC price of around $330,000, so that’s something to look forward to.

2020-02-06 18:00:30+00:00	Top 5 Crypto Trading Tips to Prepare You For the Upcoming Bull Market	[]	"Now that we are finally primed for a new bull market after two years of crypto winter, what’s the best way to prepare for those gains? Let’s take a look at 5 need to know tips to make sure you’re not singing the crypto blues.



1. Always get your funds off the crypto exchange after you’ve finished trading

Exchanges are notoriously insecure, whether they get hacked, mismanage user funds, exit scam, or pull a surprise shotgun AML/KYC to seize your funds, you’re always at risk with your funds on the exchange. There are very valid reasons why “Not your keys, not your Bitcoin” is a mantra among traders and hodlers. Many traders have been cleaned out by hacks, unethical exchanges, and exit scams.

With surprise AML/KYC seizure, it may be possible to recover funds, if you don’t mind doxxing yourself, but some platforms simply make the demands for info so egregious that you may never get your coins back.

2. Don’t talk about your coins or trades on social media

Opsec (operational security) is king in the land of crypto. During the last bull market we saw people get kidnapped, become victims of home invasions, or $5 dollar wrench attacks, and get robbed for everything. All because they wanted to brag on social media. Please don’t do this, it’s like painting a big red target on your back.

On many social media profiles, people can find out where you are, where you live, who your friends and family are, etc. Not the kind of info you want criminals to have, especially when they see you posting about how much money you just made. Here’s a list of people who have been attacked for coins.

3. Keep your coins in a hardware wallet offline

Another opsec consideration in your mind as a trader, should be to store your coins offline in a hardware wallet. You can keep the hardware wallet and recovery seed in different, but secure locations. Hacking and ransomware is an epidemic online, and keeping your coins off your laptop, in a hardware wallet is an easy way to simply sidestep the risk of losing coins this way.

A thief can still possibly hack or steal your coins with a $5 wrench attack, so you’ve also got to take into consideration a safe way to store your hardware wallet, but keeping your coins in such a device is way more secure than on a device connected to the web.

4. Don’t fall victim to trading signal scammers or paid groups

During the last bull run, we saw a million and one trading coaches pop up out of nowhere offering courses, trading signals, and paid trading signal groups. These guys are frauds, if they were making money trading they wouldn’t be selling signals, or courses.



You can learn how to trade by taking free courses, or reading free ebooks about trading, and practicing on a demo account. Don’t pay money to a scammer who is just taking advantage of noob traders.

5. Do your own research on the crypto projects you’re investing in

Crypto is full of scammers, it is a mostly unregulated market, with highly valuable bearer assets. It attracts the most unscrupulous people on earth. During the ICO craze in 2017, we saw so many scams and terrible investments it was incredible.

The scammers in crypto basically forced the hand of the world’s regulatory agencies who stepped in en masse and put an end to the scammer’s free for all. There were exit scams, fake projects, affinity scams, outright thefts, unregistered securities, ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes. Basically, every kind of shady scam you can imagine. One ICO even used a picture of the actor Ryan Gosling, for their supposed “graphic designer”.

Do your due diligence and make sure you are fully aware of what you’re investing in, and if the exchange you’re using is scammy or not. Be careful out there, and make some money!

Cryptocurrency markets have been climbing higher in value as coins like BTC have gained over 19% during the last 90 days. However, many other digital assets have seen much larger gains and BTC dominance has been sliding downwards consecutively for the last 14 days.

BTC’s Ratio of Market Dominance Sinks to 60%

During the last few weeks, BTC dominance has dropped from a high of 70% to a low of 60%. The term and metric BTC dominance is the ratio of BTC’s market capitalization versus all the other coin market caps. So the current market valuation of the entire cryptoconomy is around $305 billion and BTC captures 61% of that today with a market valuation of around $186 billion. BTC has always been the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and prior to February 2017, the asset captured more than 80% of the entire cryptoconomy for eight years straight. However, the video tweet below shared in 2018 shows how crypto dominance metrics can change drastically over time.

After February 26, 2017, BTC dominance slid from 85% to a low of 40% one month later. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) spiked to an all-time high of 31% of the cryptoconomy’s overall valuation and XRP was at 17%. A number of people believe that BTC’s rising network fees and clogged backlog (mempool) of transactions in 2017 and 2018 attributed to the decline. Alongside this, many crypto proponents and traders referred to the time as “alt season,” in which a variety of alternative digital assets reduce BTC’s share of the entire coin market cap.

After BTC dropped to a low of 40%, the dominance metric slid even lower in January 2018 as BTC dominance was around 33%. Since then, the digital currency has regained a lot of market cap dominance and BTC had risen to close to 70% on September 8, 2019. However, after the jump to 70%, BTC’s share of the cryptoconomy has been sliding once again. From September’s high of 70%, BTC dominance has dropped down to 60% on February 15, 2020, losing roughly 10%. The sliding metric has been due to other digital assets that have done far better percentage-wise as far as gains are concerned. For instance, during the last 90 days, BTC has gained 19%, but ETH jumped 52%, XRP 26%, BCH 82%, and BSV rose by 185% in that time period. BTC dominance has slid consecutively for the last 14 days straight to its current low and only today has it started to rise again slightly. It’s been one of the longest downward slides for BTC dominance since September 2018.

Are Market Valuations and Dominance Important Metrics?

Even though BTC dominance is a metric used by crypto market price aggregation websites, many proponents do not believe the data reflects any real value. Market caps only reflect the current worth of every coin circulating in real-time and some people think the data can be skewed. Despite the fact that a number of crypto proponents believe market caps and dominance are inadequate value metrics and do not necessarily reflect the project’s real worth, these metrics are used by the majority of crypto enthusiasts. In the early days, after assets like namecoin, ripple, litecoin, and mastercoin appeared, the website coinmarketcap.com was developed and the public were able to compare coins based on market valuations. There’s now a great variety of coin market cap aggregation websites that show similar data and provide other statistics too like trade volumes.

Despite some believing that market cap lists are not a good reflection of real value, individuals find the data very important. As mentioned above, investors believe there are significant reasons for BTC dominance declines, whether it was the network stress or alt season that prompted the decline from 85% to 33%. Market caps and dominance metrics show investors the level of risk involved as small-caps, mid-caps, and large-caps see different types of movements.

Traditionally, mid to small market caps are far more volatile than larger-cap cryptocurrencies and they can spike in price and drop in value very quickly. People view market valuation and dominance as a reliability metric because large caps usually present less risk to investors. Smaller crypto market caps provide investors with high-risk trading situations which can be good or bad depending on how the individual is trading.

The fact that BTC lost 61% of the dominance it commanded over the entire cryptoconomy between February 2017 and January 2018 is a metric of great importance to a lot of crypto enthusiasts. When BTC’s dominance climbed from 33% back to 70%, some maximalists and hardcore BTC supporters said that “altcoins were dying.” Although ever since this, altcoin values have been outperforming BTC by a long shot. Lesser known coins are also outpacing many coins in the top 20. BCH and ETH’s rise during the last 90 days did outperform BTC, but coins like presearch (PRE 2,641%), cryptaur (CPT 1,351%), htmlcoin (HTML 333%), vetri (VLD 322%), and Digixdao (DGD 308%) did even better.
