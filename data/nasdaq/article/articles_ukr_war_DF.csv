He Began Writing About Blockchain Technology In He Has Managed Numerous Crypto-Related Projects', 'Is Passionate About All Things Blockchain.']	"Bitcoin was rejected at $43,000 once again, and the bears pushed the asset to and below $42,000. Most altcoins are also deep in the red, with ETH close to $3,100. The total market cap is down to just over $1.9 trillion.

Bitcoin Tests $42K

It was just a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency was attempting to overcome $47,000 but failed on both occasions. Just the opposite, the asset started to lose value gradually and slipped to $45,000 a day later.

The bears kept control over the market and pushed it south again. At first, BTC dropped to $44,000 before it plummeted to $43,000, which became its lowest price point in more than two weeks.

In the following few days, bitcoin remained stuck between $43,000 and $44,000. However, its inability to climb above the latter meant more trouble. This time, it fell to $42,000 as reported yesterday.

It bounced off hours later and briefly exceeded $43,000, but the bears came back to play and drove it south below the January 2021 ATH of $42,000, where it’s currently situated as well. As such, its market capitalization has slid below $800 billion for the first time in nearly three weeks.

Altcoins Back in Red

The altcoins calmed yesterday after the recent price declines, but the past 24 hours spelled more trouble. Ethereum is down by 4% on the day and sits just above $3,100. It’s worth noting that ETH jumped above $3,500 to a three-month high last week.

Binance Coin, Solana, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and CRO have retraced by similar percentages, while Ripple and Cardano are down by more than 5%.

More losses are evident from Terra (-9%), Avalanche (-7%), Polkadot (-8%), and NEAR Protocol (-8%).

The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets is down to just over $1.9 trillion, meaning that the metric has shed $250 billion in about a week."

He Began Writing About Blockchain Technology In He Has Managed Numerous Crypto-Related Projects', 'Is Passionate About All Things Blockchain.']	"After dipping to $40,000 yesterday, bitcoin went on the offensive and tapped $42,000 to mark a near 10-day high. The altcoins have also turned green today, with Ethereum eyeing $3,000 and Avalanche soaring by over 9%.

Bitcoin Sees a 9-Day High

The primary cryptocurrency experienced enhanced volatility last week when it suddenly pumped by $3,000 in minutes from $39,000 to nearly $42,000. However, the situation reversed shortly after, and the asset retraced just as quickly to its starting level.

It reclaimed $40,000 a day later, but then the US Federal Reserve confirmed its plans to raise the interest rates by 25 basis points. Consequently, bitcoin slid once again and dropped by around $1,000.

Yet, this price retracement was short-lived, and the cryptocurrency went on the offensive again. It remained around and above $40,000 for the next few days.

Hours ago, though, bitcoin initiated another leg up by briefly exceeding $42,000 for the first time since March 10. As of now, the asset stands just under that level, and its market capitalization is close to $800 billion.

Alts in Green Led by AVAX

The alternative coins were also relatively calm in the past few days, but green now dominates the market. Ethereum is among the best performers from the larger-cap alts.

The second-largest crypto is up by 5% and stands well above $2,900. Roughly a week ago, ETH had dipped below $2,500.

Binance Coin, Ripple, Terra, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu are also well in the green with increases of between 2% and 5%.

Avalanche is the most significant gainer from the larger-caps with a 9.5% surge. As a result, AVAX stands above $85.

More daily increases come from SNX (22%), Zcash (13%), Waves (12.5%), THORChain (11%), Fantom (10%), and others.

Ultimately, the crypto market cap has added around $80 billion in a day and is close to $1.9 trillion."
2022-03-04 10:42:17+00:00	Crypto Market Sheds Nearly $100 Billion Overnight	['Decrypt', 'Liam J. Kelly']	"The total market capitalization of the crypto industry has fallen by almost 4% amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Bitcoin also dropped by almost 4% over the past 24 hours, falling from roughly $44,000 yesterday to $41,100 early this morning. The leading cryptocurrency has since recovered some and is currently trading at jsut over $41,600, according to data pulled from CoinGecko.

Ethereum is down over 5% after nearly crossing the psychologically important $3,000 mark on Thursday afternoon. Since then, the smart contracts platform has steadily shed points through the night and into this morning. It is now trading hands at $2,740.

These losses come after both assets clawed back from even steeper losses at the end of February. Bitcoin plummeted to just over $34,000 and Ethereum fell to $2,300 on February 24.

Other cryptocurrencies aren’t faring much better. Of the top ten largest cryptocurrencies, Solana is the market’s biggest loser, with its native token, SOL, down nearly 6.8% over the day and is now trading at just over $92.

Elsewhere, Polkadot and Avalanche, two popular “Ethereum-killers,” have looked bearish too. Both cryptocurrencies are down approximately 3.5% over the past day.

Popular crypto-adjacent stocks like Coinbase, PayPal, and Block aren’t providing investors with much shelter either. Coinbase (COIN) is down more than 8%, Block (SQ) is down 8%, and PayPal (PYPL) is down nearly 5%.

Crypto market reacts to Russian invasion

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has wreaked havoc on the crypto market.

Besides bearish price action, the events have also sparked calls for crypto exchanges to plug holes in the sweeping set of financial sanctions against Russia.

Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for example, said that she was “disappointed” that crypto exchanges weren’t doing more against its Russian users.

“I was disappointed to see that some of the so-called crypto exchanges, not all of them, but some of them, are refusing to end transactions with Russia,” Clinton said during a recent interview on The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC.

Amid these calls, Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken have decided not to ban Russian users en masse, claiming that there is no legal grounds to do so.

Binance has, however, reportedly banned individual citizens from using the platform. In an interview with BBC on the subject, Changpeng Zhao, Binance's CEO, said, however, that he did not know how many accounts on the platform had been banned.

Crypto news and prices of BTC, Ethereum, Solana as Russia invades Ukraine	[]	"Bitcoin’s price has fallen even lower after the cryptocurrency market dipped into a crash this week as the toll of increased conflict in Europe and Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine saw markets fall worldwide.

The cryptocurrency market is currently down by more than 10% on Thursday morning, as of 11.20am UK time, according to Coinbase.

After a continued lull for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, it now looks to be approaching a $30,000 threshold today (Thursday February 24) should market dips continue.

Bitcoin price: Why is crypto down today? Crypto news and prices of BTC, Ethereum, Solana as Russia invades Ukraine (Image credit: Getty Images/Canva Pro)

As of 11.34am on Thursday, Bitcoin’s price was fluctuating at around $34,966.62 (£26,080.62) in a 10.23% fall on the last 24 hours, and a 19% fall on the last seven days, according to Coinbase.

The cryptocurrency market has been struggling to return to highs reached in late 2021 as inflation, looming conflict in Europe and global market uncertainty over crypto risks continue to push crypto price thresholds lower.

The crypto market dip, reflecting a fall on the FTSE 100, comes as Russia increases its attacks on Ukraine and launched a full scale invasion of the country, as the EU, UK and US propose further sanctions on the country.

NATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg said in a statement on Thursday afternoon that Russia has launched missile attacks targeting Ukraine’s military infrastructure in an ""unjustified and unprovoked"" attack on the country.

""This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long planned invasion,"" he added.

The downward slide in crypto prices suggests that the crash which saw prices plummet in early January, as Kazakhstan’s crypto mining empire took a hit during political unrest, could be set to continue amid a wider market sell-off.

Here’s why crypto is down today, what’s happening to crypto at the moment and the latest prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, Shiba Inu coin and Dogecoin.

What is Bitcoin’s price today?

Bitcoin’s price is currently trading at $35,452.90 (£26,417.69) in a 9% fall on the last 24 hours as of 11.58am, according to Coinbase.

Bitcoin has been fluctuating between $36,000 and $38,000 in value this week after falling from its $40,000 threshold again on Sunday February 20.

But in the early hours of Thursday morning, Bitcoin’s price dropped from $36,887.71 at 2.30am to $34,787.94 at 4.30am, with this plunging even lower later this morning as its price dropped to $34,322 at 5.45am.

According to data collected by CoinMarketCap, however, Bitcoin is seeing increased trading activity – with its 24 hour trading volume up 55.6% as of 12.03pm on Thursday at $37,439,624,337 as investors buy the dip.

Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating mostly between $40,000 and $45,000 – hitting a recent high of $52,100 on December 27.

The major cryptocurrency’s price has seen recent gains of almost $20,000 wiped off the board for Bitcoin after it came the closest it ever has to reaching a new landmark threshold of $70,000 in November.

Why is crypto down today?

Bitcoin’s price enjoyed a bullish rise to near $70,000 in value in early November as investors hoped to see the cryptocurrency’s $1 trillion market cap remain firmly in place ahead of a volatile trading period.

But its plummet below $50,000 came in late 2021 as US and UK markets struggled to contend with increased concerns over increasing inflation and looming conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Such concerns have now come to a head with Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday February 24 2022, with fears for global market stability, national security and Ukraine’s safety taking hold as oil prices surge, traditional markets drop and more sanctions on Russia are to be declared.

Bitcoin’s price dipped below $40,000 on Friday January 21 after the Russian central bank published a consultation paper which warned that ‘growth of cryptocurrencies use creates threats for Russian retail investors, financial stability and threats associated with the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities’.

The report cited estimates that cryptocurrency transactions among Russian citizens totals up to $5 billion a year.

In particular, the report focused on the threats of cryptocurrency’s high volatility and instability for individual citizens, as well as its fraudulent and criminal usage.

However, the Russian central bank also likened the global growth of cryptocurrencies in Russia to ‘dollarisation’, stating that ‘cryptoisation limits monetary policy sovereignty, which might force central bank to permanently maintain a higher key rate to contain inflation’.

It added that ‘the spread of cryptocurrencies could make people withdraw their savings from the Russian financial sector and, subsequently, decrease its capability to finance the real sector and potential economic growth reducing the number of jobs and potential for household income increase.’

Meanwhile, the UK Government outlined a tougher approach to crypto-asset promotion and advertising in a statement in mid-January.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims.

""We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.”

On Monday January 24, US market analysts warned that the rise in inflation could see the US Federal Open Market Committee take faster, earlier action in coming months to tighten US monetary policy – prompting fears in traditional and cryptocurrency markets to take hold in another huge sell-off.

Cryptocurrency market prices today

With cryptocurrencies often moving in tandem with Bitcoin, Ethereum, the cryptocurrency synonymous with the rising crypto trend of NFTs, was trading down by

more than 11% on Thursday after hitting a new record high of almost $5,000 in early November.

Ethereum’s price has dipped further below its previous $3,000 threshold and was trading at $2,388.18 (£1,779.49) at 11.43am on Thursday, in a further 11.14% fall on the last 24 hours.

The hype surrounding popular memecoin Dogecoin has likewise been fluctuating in recent months as new alt and meme coins have stolen the spotlight.

Dogecoin’s price was trading down by more than 17% on the last 24 hours at $0.11 (£0.08) on Thursday morning.

Shiba Inu coin, the so-called ‘Dogecoin killer’, was trading almost 20% down on the last 24 hours at $0.00002170 (£0.00001620) as of 11.46am on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Cardano’s (ADA) price is fluctuating around $0.76 (£0.57) in 18.56% fall on the last 24 hours, XRP was down 13.19% at $0.64 (£0.47) and Solana was down by 12.7% at $81.20 (£60.60) as of 11.47am on Thursday.

When was the last crypto crash?

In June, the Chinese Government cracked down on considerable crypto mining operations taking place in the Sichuan province and demanded that Chinese banks and payment channels stop supporting decentralised and anonymous crypto transactions.

This saw Bitcoin prices tumble to below $30,000 in a dramatic plummet from its soaring success.

The cryptocurrency has continued to rise and fall as other global administrations and regulators mull legislation to curb increased crypto activity often attributed to laundering and crime.

Following the Chinese state’s move, countries like South Korea also pledged to tackle the rise in money laundering taking place via cryptocurrency, while the Metropolitan Police announced that it had successfully closed in on a huge UK cryptocurrency money-laundering operation.

July saw the Met seize a cryptocurrency operation valued at £180million in the UK’s largest cryptocurrency seizure to date.

Cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Binance have since been feeling the heat across the world as regulators and governments began to turn the screws on the operations of such platforms in the wake of crypto’s global crackdown.

The result of this saw Bitcoin’s highest prices sliced in half in June, with the coin struggling to break out of the low to mid $30k price range until it received a welcome boost from Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his appearance at major Bitcoin conference in July.

The bullish rise and increased confidence in Bitcoin could see it remain at prices fluctuating between $60,000 and $70,000 in future, but with increased resistance as it lurches further away from a previous $100,000 price prediction for 2022.

2022-03-14 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptocurrencies in the EU: new rules to boost benefits and curb threats	[]	"On Monday evening, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee adopted, with 31 votes to 4 and 23 abstentions, its negotiating position on new rules on crypto-assets. They aim to boost users’ confidence and support the development of digital services and alternative payment instruments.

Key provisions agreed by MEPs for those issuing and trading crypto-assets (including asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens) cover transparency, disclosure, authorisation and supervision of transactions. Consumers would be better informed about risks, costs and charges. In addition, the legal framework supports market integrity and financial stability by regulating public offers of crypto-assets. Finally, the agreed text includes measures against market manipulation and to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities.

Environmental threats

To reduce the high carbon footprint of crypto-currencies, particularly of the mechanisms used to validate transactions, MEPs ask the Commission to present MEPs with a legislative proposal to include in the EU taxonomy (a classification system) for sustainable activities any crypto-asset mining activities that contribute substantially to climate change, by 1 January 2025.

MEPs stress that other industries (e.g. the video games and entertainment industry, data centres) also consume energy resources that are not climate-friendly. They call for the Commission to work on legislation addressing these issues across different sectors.

Supervision

MEPs want the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to supervise the issuance of asset-referenced tokens, whereas the European Banking Authority (EBA) will be in charge of supervising electronic money tokens.

Quote

Stefan Berger (EPP, DE), the lead MEP, said: ""By adopting the MiCA report, the European Parliament has paved the way for an innovation-friendly crypto-regulation that can set standards worldwide. The regulation being created is pioneering in terms of innovation, consumer protection, legal certainty and the establishment of reliable supervisory structures in the field of crypto-assets. Many countries around the world will now take a close look at MiCA.""

Next steps

A decision to enter into negotiations with EU governments on the final shape of the bill was adopted with 33 votes to 25.

Background

Crypto-assets, including cryptocurrencies, are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority. They are currently out of the scope of EU legislation. This creates risks for consumer protection and financial stability, and could lead to market manipulation and financial crime. The draft legislation differentiates between crypto assets in general, asset referenced tokens (ARTs), also called “stable coins”, and e-money tokens primarily used for payments.

Mechanisms used to validate transactions in crypto-assets have a substantial environmental impact, particularly for proof-of-work mechanisms, requiring a lot of energy and resulting in a high carbon footprint and generating electronic waste. According to most estimates, the energy consumption of Bitcoin equals that of entire small countries."
2022-04-05 17:00:50+00:00	Crypto Market Comes To A Standstill As Sentiment Rolls Into Neutral	[]	"The Crypto market has been fluctuating heavily in the past couple of weeks but with last week’s rally had finally landed into the greed territory. However, as the rally had slowed down and the inevitable market correction had begun, sentiment had begun to shift once again into the negative. This had caused the Fear & Greed Index to reverse out of the greed territory, finally ending in neutral. Now, the market remains at a standstill waiting for the next move.

Crypto Fear & Greed Index In Neutral

The crypto Fear & Greed Index helps map out how investors are feeling towards the market. Currently, it is neither good nor bad which has seen the index languishing in neutral territory. It is important to note that sentiment had driven far into greed as bitcoin had made its way to $47,000 but now, most of that positive sentiment seems to have washed away after bitcoin had made a slight decline that brought it back into the $46,000 region.

With bitcoin’s decline, the whole market had naturally taken a tumble along with it. This inevitably brought down the total market cap back into the low $2 trillion. Nevertheless, the market has begun to recover once more, which would explain why the index did not completely slip into the fear region.

Last week, the index had finished in greed, a stark contrast to the extreme fear in which the index had closed the previous month. The current location of the index at a neutral 52 suggests that investors are not making any important moves in the market. Mostly, the buys and sells have been balancing out each other and investors are not moving either way at present.

This is easily understandable given that the market had mostly slowed to a crawl in terms of momentum. Top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to trend in the same region, struggling to make it above the next significant resistance points. While the rest of the market waits to follow what the market leaders do.

However, since the majority of the market continues to trade in the green, the Fear & Greed is skewed towards greed despite being in the neutral territory. With what looks like another bounce-off point for the crypto market, the index may very well be back in greed before the week runs out.

2022-02-25 13:23:34+00:00	Unusual Bearish Signal Appears on Crypto Market: Here's What It Means	['About The Author', 'Arman Shirinyan']	"Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only. It does not necessarily reflect the opinion of U.Today. Every investment and all trading involves risk, so you should always perform your own research prior to making decisions. We do not recommend investing money you cannot afford to lose.

With the risk-off tendencies rapidly rising in financial markets, technical and on-chain signals appear here and there, suggesting that both good and bad things could happen to the industry in the upcoming days or even weeks. Here is the signal highlighted by Bloomberg that might be considered the main sign of a downtrend on the market.

Stablecoin capitalization is a commonly used metric that tracks the total volume of funds entering and leaving a class of assets. According to the provided data, it currently stays at approximately $180 billion, up from $38 billion only a year ago.

The long-term rise in the capitalization of stablecoins is not suggesting any abnormal or negative activity on the market, but the short-term spike in inflows to stablecoins could reflect fundamental issues on the market as more traders and investors move their funds to stable solutions rather than betting on risky assets like Bitcoin and altcoins.

It is important to note that the popularity of stablecoins has risen due to the development of borrowing and lending solutions that allow users to receive stable income thanks to DeFi platforms.

But whenever the crypto market capitalization shrinks and the stablecoin supply rises or remains the same, it most likely suggests that the majority of players on the market moved their funds into stable solutions to avoid additional losses. The same trend is being observed now as the biggest stablecoin on the market, Tether, faced a $3 billion market capitalization increase in the last six days.

At press time, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market remains at $1.7 trillion, with a $100 billion increase since yesterday's crypto market sell-off."
2022-03-11 02:18:03+00:00	Bitcoin falls 5%, other crypto prices today also plunge while Terra surges	[]	"In cryptocurrencies , Bitcoin plunged below back below $39,000, erasing gains sparked after US President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto, as digital tokens fell with stocks on Thursday amid high inflation data and continued geopolitical uncertainty. Bitcoin price today were trading over 5% lower at $38,655. The world's most popular and largest cryptocurrency is down about 16% in 2022 (year-to-date or YTD) so far.

US stocks and other risk-on assets were under pressure after US inflation jumped to a 40-year high and as the war in Ukraine continues to weigh on commodities. In recent years, Bitcoin has demonstrated a tendency to follow moves in the stock market.

On the other hand, Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain and the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, also plunged over 4% to $2,567. Dogecoin price declined more than 3% to $0.11 whereas Shiba Inu was trading 4% lower at $0.000022.

The performance of other digital tokens also tanked as Avalanche, Polygon, Cardano, Litecoin prices declined while Stellar, XRP, Uniswap, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot were trading with cuts in the range of 3-8%, however, Terra was higher with gains of about 2% over the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market capitalisation remained below the $2 trillion mark at $1.81 trillion, more than 5% change in the last 24 hours, as per CoinGecko.

The recent volatility in cryptocurrencies has come amid a broader market selloff amid escalating geopolitical tensions due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis. The volatility has also been driven by investors recalibrating their portfolios to account for a more aggressive Fed, which is now expected to raise rates as many as seven times this year as it fights surging inflation.
