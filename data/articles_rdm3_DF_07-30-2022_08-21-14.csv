2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00	Why bitcoin's down and 4 other key things that happened in crypto this past week	['Taylor Locke']	"1. House Democrats propose plan to close crypto tax loophole

On Sept. 13, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed legislation that would close a tax loophole for cryptocurrency investors by imposing ""wash sale"" rules on commodities, currencies and digital assets, according to a released outline. Currently, investors can sell cryptocurrency for a loss and claim a tax benefit. Then, investors can immediately buy back the asset if it rebounds. So-called ""wash sale"" rules would prevent investors from buying the same asset back right away. Subjecting cryptocurrency and other assets to this proposed change would raise $16.8 billion over a decade, according to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

2. Senators demand cryptocurrency regulation guidance from SEC

On Tuesday, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the Senate Banking Committee that the SEC is working overtime to create a set of rules for cryptocurrency markets to protect investors. ""Currently, we just don't have enough investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading, or lending,"" Gensler said in prepared remarks. ""Frankly, at this time, it's more like the Wild West or the old world of 'buyer beware' that existed before the securities laws were enacted."" Some lawmakers also pressed Gensler about whether certain crypto assets, like stablecoins, meet the definition of a security, which has been an ongoing subject of concern and confusion for regulators and the crypto community.

3. Ray Dalio says if bitcoin is really successful, regulators will ‘kill it’

On Wednesday, Ray Dalio told CNBC that he believes that regulators would ultimately take control of bitcoin if the cryptocurrency is successful. ""I think at the end of the day if it's really successful, they will kill it and they will try to kill it. And I think they will kill it because they have ways of killing it,"" Dalio told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the SALT conference. ""You have El Salvador taking it on and you have India and China getting rid of it. And you have the United States talking about how to regulate it and it could still be controlled,"" he said. Still, Dalio disclosed that he has ""a certain amount of money in bitcoin,"" but noted that the allocation is smaller than his gold exposure. ""It's an amazing accomplishment to have brought it from where that programming occurred to where it is through the test of time,"" he said.

Crypto markets have dropped a great deal in value over the last 24 hours as crypto assets across the board have lost anywhere between 7-15% in value during this time period. The overall market valuation of all 10,000+ crypto-assets in existence has slid just below the $2 trillion handle, losing over 9% in value during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Economy Slips by 9% During the Last 24 Hours

Bitcoin (BTC) prices were above the $48K zone on Sunday, September 19, but the following day, BTC prices are much lower as the crypto asset dropped to a low of $42,660 per unit on Monday. BTC has shed 8.9% in value and the digital asset’s market valuation is around $815 billion today. At the time of writing, a single BTC is swapping for just above $43K per coin.

The second-leading crypto asset, ethereum (ETH) has dropped 10.3% in value during the last day and each ether is exchanging hands for just above $3K per unit. ETH has an overall market valuation of around $355.4 billion on Monday.

The biggest loser out of the top ten crypto-asset market positions is XRP, shedding 13.8% during the course of the last day. Bitcoin’s (BTC) 8% loss is the least of all the percentage losses on Monday. Just before BTC’s slide below $45K, Etoro’s crypto analyst discussed the current market events.

“Bitcoin and ether both experienced a weekend slip after a week of climbing back to previous highs,” Simon Peters, Etoro’s crypto analyst wrote in a note to Bitcoin.com News on Monday morning. “BTC began the week below $45,000 after the flash crash of the week before. Having risen across the week to near $49,000 levels the price collapsed again on Sunday, falling away to now trade around $45,500.” Peters added:

Likewise, ETH began the week trading around $3,200 before rising to a high of $3,652 on Thursday. The token began a decline earlier than bitcoin though, falling away from Thursday and across the weekend to now trade below $3,200, a 13% decline.

Cosmos Remains Unscathed, Fears of Economic Turmoil Stemming from Evergrande Collapse and Default Risks Rise

Overall, the entire crypto market cap has lost over 9% in fiat value between Sunday and Monday. The top coins being traded include nine different stablecoins. Besides the stablecoin action today, the coin that took the least amount of fiat loss is cosmos (ATOM). Cosmos only lost 0.9% on Monday and is up over 9% for the last seven days. The biggest loser today is Algorand (ALGO) losing 16.6% during the last 24 hours.

Cryptocurrency markets have followed the drop across all global markets on Monday as a few warnings of economic turmoil have arisen. For instance, news outlets detail that the U.S. may default on financial obligations which could turn into another financial crisis.

The secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Janet Yellen, has warned of a debt ceiling fallout. Furthermore, global stock markets are in the red over China Evergrande shares dropping like a rock. Evergrande shares saw an 11-year low and speculators have claimed the Evergrande collapse could be like the next Lehman Brothers crisis.

Redman Has Been An Active Member Of The Cryptocurrency Community Since He Has A Passion For Bitcoin', 'Open-Source Code', 'Decentralized Applications.

While bitcoin prices have risen in value during the last two weeks, bitcoin dominance levels have slipped to lows not seen since the June 6 low of 41%, and the dip to 39.97% on May 16, 2021. Depending on the crypto market price aggregator leveraged, bitcoin’s dominance has been between 39.99% to 41.52%. Meanwhile, as bitcoin’s dominance has dropped significantly, crypto-asset markets like ethereum, cardano, binance coin, and tether have seen market dominance, in terms of overall valuation, steadily increase among the 10,000+ coins in existence today.

As Bitcoin Slides to the 40% Range, Ethereum Climbs to 20% of the Crypto Economy

It is well known that between the first time bitcoin (BTC) prices were calculated by market capitalization, and all the way up until February 2017, BTC had more than an 80% market dominance among all the other coins, for a majority of the time.

There was an instance in 2014, where BTC dropped to 77.9% in December and again in March 2016 to 76.42%. After the March 2016 dip, there were a few quick instances of dominance levels dipping under 80%, but nothing like what happened in February 2017.

On February 19, 2017, BTC’s dominance levels slid from 85.4% to a low of 37.84% in June 2017. From here bitcoin has never managed to move above the 80% handle since then and in September 2019, it rose above the 70% handle but for only a few days.

On March 1, 2021, BTC again tapped the 70% handle, but has since lost the market dominance again. One of the biggest markets eating into BTC’s cap is ethereum (ETH), which holds a 19.4% market dominance according to Coingecko stats.

Messari.io says ETH’s cap is 19.99% and coinmarketcap.com says the dominance level is 20.1%. Ethereum’s market valuation is around $460 billion on Sunday, September 5, 2021. During the last 24 hours, these three aggregators show BTC’s dominance has fluctuated between 39.99% to 41.52%.

Bitcoin’s market valuation at the time of writing on Sunday, September 5, is an aggregate total of around $940 billion. Other coin market caps have seen massive gains and this has furthered their dominance levels, and more specifically the top ten digital currencies by market capitalization. Today, all ten coins in the top ten list command 80% of the entire $2.36 trillion crypto market economy.

The top ten markets by market capitalization today include bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), cardano (ADA), binance coin (BNB), tether (USDT), XRP, solana (SOL), dogecoin (DOGE), polkadot (DOT), and usd coin (USDC).

While ADA has more than 4% of the entire crypto-economy in terms of market dominance, BNB has 3.71%. The stablecoin tether is nearing the three percentile mark with 2.98% of the whole crypto economy. XRP is a bit lower than tether at 2.21% and the new top ten contender solana (SOL) has 1.79%.

In terms of the remaining top ten coins and the rest of the cryptocurrency market caps below them ($472 billion) are also contributing to the swelling value of the overall $2.36 trillion crypto economy. Crypto coins like fantom (FTM), iota (MIOTA), kusama (KSM), and iost (IOST) all saw significantly-sized double-digit gains during the last seven days.

New Delhi: The largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is currently down by 4.5% over the past 24 hours and has been trading around $45,463. Bitcoin touched its all-time high mark of $64,000 in April. Other popular coins like Dogecoin, XRP, and Cardano also dropped in value along with the world’s most famous coin.

As we all know the nature of the crypto market is very volatile where you can see large swings or a sudden fall with no notice, thus people find it very risky to invest in this space. An upward trend can work wonders for you if you have invested in the right coin and a downswing can leave you with less amount of money than you invested.

Ether is at $3,120 with a change of -9.36% over the last 24 hours

Cardano is at $2.1 with a change of -10% over the last 24 hours

Binance Coin is at $384 with a change of -6.7% over the last 24 hours

XRP is at 0.9602 with a change of -11% over the last 24 hours

Solana is at 140 with a change of -13% over the last 24 hours

Why the crypto market is down?

The Crypto market has already suffered series of blows apart from its regular volatility and it is difficult to mark a common problem that can state that why markets are down today.

But reports are coming through many sources that U.S. officials are looking into whether Binance or its staff profited from taking advantage of its users. The review will involve Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigators which will reach out to potential witnesses in the recent weeks."

NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency prices sank on Monday as concerns over the spillover risk to the global economy from Chinese property group Evergrande's (3333.HK) troubles spread across financial markets.

Bitcoin , the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, tumbled to $42,453.97, its lowest level since Aug. 7 before trimming some losses to trade down 7.4% at $43,745. It hit a near four-month high above $52,000 on Sept. 6.

Smaller rival ether , the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, fell more than 10% below $3,000 for the first time since early August. It was last down 7.6% at $3,071.

Market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market dropped 10% on Monday to under $1.94 trillion, from last Saturday's $2.17 trillion.

The loss in the value of cryptocurrencies comes at a time when institutional interest in the space has surged and some investment banks have ramped up their forecasts for cryptocurrencies in the coming months.

""It's red, red, red across the board today as the cryptocurrency markets follow the downturn being seen in traditional markets as China battles a highly-contagious property market crisis,"" said Tim Frost, chief executive officer at Yield App, a financial technology company that enables users to invest in decentralized finance.

""Bitcoin has lost support at the $44,000 mark and looks set to test its $39,000 floor. If it falls through here we can expect a significant correction to come,"" he added.

Bitcoin shorts in the futures markets have increased to 1,187 contracts , the largest since early August, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released Friday.

2021-09-08 02:31:04+00:00	Why Bitcoin, ether, other crypto prices are crashing	[]	"Bitcoin prices plummeted from more than $52,000 per coin, over 17% to $42,000, before recovering about half of that loss after El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday. However, the rollout stumbled in its first hours and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

Tuesday’s selloff is the most significant break in the rebound that had lifted Bitcoin almost 75% since late July. Overall cryptocurrency market value fell about $300 billion in the past 24 hours, according to tracker CoinGecko.

The world's largest cryptocurrency staged a small recovery as Bitcoin prices today were at around $46,757, down 11%. Meanwhile, other digital coins followed the lead with ether fell over 11% to $3,471 whereas dogecoin and cardano prices plunged 15% and 12% to $0.26 and $2.5 respectively. Stellar, XRP, Uniswap also crashed in the range of 15-20% over the last 24 hours.

“Social media platforms were very cautious over the weekend that a plunge could occur following El Salvador’s big day,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., wrote in a note, as reported by Bloomberg. Some investors likely bought in anticipation of the nation implementing its Bitcoin law Sept. 7 and then moved to “sell the fact,"" he said.

According to experts, bitcoin was still in the bull market as long the price stayed above the $43,000 level.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings and a long-time cryptocurrency bull, told Bloomberg the market for digital coins was running strong over the last eight weeks and became overbought. Interest from individual investors spiked on the back of large institutions jumping on board the crypto wagon, he said.

David Gerard, author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,"" told the Associated Press that Tuesday’s Bitcoin volatility likely had little to nothing to do with El Salvador. “My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

“Bitcoin basically doesn’t respond to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard said. “That sort of price pattern, where it crashes hugely in minutes then goes back up again, is usually one of the big guys burning the margin traders."" Because Bitcoin is so thinly traded, it could also have been a big holder making a large sale to have cash, thus sending the market for a ride, Gerard said.
