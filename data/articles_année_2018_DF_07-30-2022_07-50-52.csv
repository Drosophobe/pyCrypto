2017-12-11 00:00:00+00:00	Statement on Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings	[]	"The world’s social media platforms and financial markets are abuzz about cryptocurrencies and “initial coin offerings” (ICOs). There are tales of fortunes made and dreamed to be made. We are hearing the familiar refrain, “this time is different.”

The cryptocurrency and ICO markets have grown rapidly. These markets are local, national and international and include an ever-broadening range of products and participants. They also present investors and other market participants with many questions, some new and some old (but in a new form), including, to list just a few:

Is the product legal? Is it subject to regulation, including rules designed to protect investors? Does the product comply with those rules?

Is the offering legal? Are those offering the product licensed to do so?

Are the trading markets fair? Can prices on those markets be manipulated? Can I sell when I want to?

Are there substantial risks of theft or loss, including from hacking?

The answers to these and other important questions often require an in-depth analysis, and the answers will differ depending on many factors. This statement provides my general views on the cryptocurrency and ICO markets[1] and is directed principally to two groups:

“Main Street” investors, and

Market professionals – including, for example, broker-dealers, investment advisers, exchanges, lawyers and accountants – whose actions impact Main Street investors.

Considerations for Main Street Investors

A number of concerns have been raised regarding the cryptocurrency and ICO markets, including that, as they are currently operating, there is substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.

Investors should understand that to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies.[2] If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary.

We have issued investor alerts, bulletins and statements on initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency-related investments, including with respect to the marketing of certain offerings and investments by celebrities and others.[3] Please take a moment to read them. If you choose to invest in these products, please ask questions and demand clear answers. A list of sample questions that may be helpful is attached.

As with any other type of potential investment, if a promoter guarantees returns, if an opportunity sounds too good to be true, or if you are pressured to act quickly, please exercise extreme caution and be aware of the risk that your investment may be lost.

Please also recognize that these markets span national borders and that significant trading may occur on systems and platforms outside the United States. Your invested funds may quickly travel overseas without your knowledge. As a result, risks can be amplified, including the risk that market regulators, such as the SEC, may not be able to effectively pursue bad actors or recover funds.

To learn more about these markets and their regulation, please read the “Additional Discussion of Cryptocurrencies, ICOs and Securities Regulation” section below.

Considerations for Market Professionals

I believe that initial coin offerings – whether they represent offerings of securities or not – can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects. However, any such activity that involves an offering of securities must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other investor protections that our securities laws require. A change in the structure of a securities offering does not change the fundamental point that when a security is being offered, our securities laws must be followed.[4] Said another way, replacing a traditional corporate interest recorded in a central ledger with an enterprise interest recorded through a blockchain entry on a distributed ledger may change the form of the transaction, but it does not change the substance.

I urge market professionals, including securities lawyers, accountants and consultants, to read closely the investigative report we released earlier this year (the “21(a) Report”)[5] and review our subsequent enforcement actions.[6] In the 21(a) Report, the Commission applied longstanding securities law principles to demonstrate that a particular token constituted an investment contract and therefore was a security under our federal securities laws. Specifically, we concluded that the token offering represented an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.

Following the issuance of the 21(a) Report, certain market professionals have attempted to highlight utility characteristics of their proposed initial coin offerings in an effort to claim that their proposed tokens or coins are not securities. Many of these assertions appear to elevate form over substance. Merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security. Tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasize the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others continue to contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law. On this and other points where the application of expertise and judgment is expected, I believe that gatekeepers and others, including securities lawyers, accountants and consultants, need to focus on their responsibilities. I urge you to be guided by the principal motivation for our registration, offering process and disclosure requirements: investor protection and, in particular, the protection of our Main Street investors.

I also caution market participants against promoting or touting the offer and sale of coins without first determining whether the securities laws apply to those actions. Selling securities generally requires a license, and experience shows that excessive touting in thinly traded and volatile markets can be an indicator of “scalping,” “pump and dump” and other manipulations and frauds. Similarly, I also caution those who operate systems and platforms that effect or facilitate transactions in these products that they may be operating unregistered exchanges or broker-dealers that are in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

On cryptocurrencies, I want to emphasize two points. First, while there are cryptocurrencies that do not appear to be securities, simply calling something a “currency” or a currency-based product does not mean that it is not a security. Before launching a cryptocurrency or a product with its value tied to one or more cryptocurrencies, its promoters must either (1) be able to demonstrate that the currency or product is not a security or (2) comply with applicable registration and other requirements under our securities laws. Second, brokers, dealers and other market participants that allow for payments in cryptocurrencies, allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies on margin, or otherwise use cryptocurrencies to facilitate securities transactions should exercise particular caution, including ensuring that their cryptocurrency activities are not undermining their anti-money laundering and know-your-customer obligations.[7] As I have stated previously, these market participants should treat payments and other transactions made in cryptocurrency as if cash were being handed from one party to the other.

Additional Discussion of Cryptocurrencies, ICOs and Securities Regulation

Cryptocurrencies. Speaking broadly, cryptocurrencies purport to be items of inherent value (similar, for instance, to cash or gold) that are designed to enable purchases, sales and other financial transactions. They are intended to provide many of the same functions as long-established currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro or Japanese yen but do not have the backing of a government or other body. Although the design and maintenance of cryptocurrencies differ, proponents of cryptocurrencies highlight various potential benefits and features of them, including (1) the ability to make transfers without an intermediary and without geographic limitation, (2) finality of settlement, (3) lower transaction costs compared to other forms of payment and (4) the ability to publicly verify transactions. Other often-touted features of cryptocurrencies include personal anonymity and the absence of government regulation or oversight. Critics of cryptocurrencies note that these features may facilitate illicit trading and financial transactions, and that some of the purported beneficial features may not prove to be available in practice.

It has been asserted that cryptocurrencies are not securities and that the offer and sale of cryptocurrencies are beyond the SEC’s jurisdiction. Whether that assertion proves correct with respect to any digital asset that is labeled as a cryptocurrency will depend on the characteristics and use of that particular asset. In any event, it is clear that, just as the SEC has a sharp focus on how U.S. dollar, euro and Japanese yen transactions affect our securities markets, we have the same interests and responsibilities with respect to cryptocurrencies. This extends, for example, to securities firms and other market participants that allow payments to be made in cryptocurrencies, set up structures to invest in or hold cryptocurrencies, or extend credit to customers to purchase or hold cryptocurrencies.

Initial Coin Offerings. Coinciding with the substantial growth in cryptocurrencies, companies and individuals increasingly have been using initial coin offerings to raise capital for their businesses and projects. Typically these offerings involve the opportunity for individual investors to exchange currency such as U.S. dollars or cryptocurrencies in return for a digital asset labeled as a coin or token.

These offerings can take many different forms, and the rights and interests a coin is purported to provide the holder can vary widely. A key question for all ICO market participants: “Is the coin or token a security?” As securities law practitioners know well, the answer depends on the facts. For example, a token that represents a participation interest in a book-of-the-month club may not implicate our securities laws, and may well be an efficient way for the club’s operators to fund the future acquisition of books and facilitate the distribution of those books to token holders. In contrast, many token offerings appear to have gone beyond this construct and are more analogous to interests in a yet-to-be-built publishing house with the authors, books and distribution networks all to come. It is especially troubling when the promoters of these offerings emphasize the secondary market trading potential of these tokens. Prospective purchasers are being sold on the potential for tokens to increase in value – with the ability to lock in those increases by reselling the tokens on a secondary market – or to otherwise profit from the tokens based on the efforts of others. These are key hallmarks of a security and a securities offering.

By and large, the structures of initial coin offerings that I have seen promoted involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements and other investor protection provisions of our federal securities laws. Generally speaking, these laws provide that investors deserve to know what they are investing in and the relevant risks involved.

I have asked the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to continue to police this area vigorously and recommend enforcement actions against those that conduct initial coin offerings in violation of the federal securities laws.

Conclusion

We at the SEC are committed to promoting capital formation. The technology on which cryptocurrencies and ICOs are based may prove to be disruptive, transformative and efficiency enhancing. I am confident that developments in fintech will help facilitate capital formation and provide promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike.

I encourage Main Street investors to be open to these opportunities, but to ask good questions, demand clear answers and apply good common sense when doing so. When advising clients, designing products and engaging in transactions, market participants and their advisers should thoughtfully consider our laws, regulations and guidance, as well as our principles-based securities law framework, which has served us well in the face of new developments for more than 80 years. I also encourage market participants and their advisers to engage with the SEC staff to aid in their analysis under the securities laws. Staff providing assistance on these matters remain available at FinTech@sec.gov.

Sample Questions for Investors Considering a Cryptocurrency or ICO

Investment Opportunity [8]

Who exactly am I contracting with? Who is issuing and sponsoring the product, what are their backgrounds, and have they provided a full and complete description of the product? Do they have a clear written business plan that I understand? Who is promoting or marketing the product, what are their backgrounds, and are they licensed to sell the product? Have they been paid to promote the product? Where is the enterprise located?

Where is my money going and what will it be used for? Is my money going to be used to “cash out” others?

What specific rights come with my investment?

Are there financial statements? If so, are they audited, and by whom?

Is there trading data? If so, is there some way to verify it?

How, when, and at what cost can I sell my investment? For example, do I have a right to give the token or coin back to the company or to receive a refund? Can I resell the coin or token, and if so, are there any limitations on my ability to resell?

If a digital wallet is involved, what happens if I lose the key? Will I still have access to my investment?

If a blockchain is used, is the blockchain open and public? Has the code been published, and has there been an independent cybersecurity audit?

Has the offering been structured to comply with the securities laws and, if not, what implications will that have for the stability of the enterprise and the value of my investment?

What legal protections may or may not be available in the event of fraud, a hack, malware, or a downturn in business prospects? Who will be responsible for refunding my investment if something goes wrong?

If I do have legal rights, can I effectively enforce them and will there be adequate funds to compensate me if my rights are violated?"

A look at the market's most recent session (18:00 to 24:00 UTC) indicates litecoin, bitcoin and IOTA all gained more than 5 percent in the 6-hour span (despite being down on the day).
2018-01-16 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin, Ethereum and almost every other cryptocurrency is plunging – TechCrunch	['Jon Russell']	"Bitcoin, Ethereum and almost every other cryptocurrency is plunging

Look away now if you own bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This won’t be breaking news to you if you are invested, but today has seen the entire crypto market fall by double-digit percentages.

The price of bitcoin slumped by 15 percent to drop below $12,000 for the first time since December 4. Ethereum, meanwhile, fell by over 20 percent to hover above $1,000 and Ripple is down 33 percent to $1.23 at the time of writing.

The price drop is having a huge impact. According to Coinmarketcap.com, a site that is quickly becoming the go-to price checker, just one of the top 100 highest valued cryptocurrencies isn’t in the red over the past 24 hours. That’s Tether.

It’s a far cry from when bitcoin hit a record of close to $20,000 exactly a month ago on December 16.

Despite the drop, Ethereum, Ripple and the rest of the alt coins have largely fared worse than bitcoin.

The top 10 based on coin market caps…

Numbers 11-20…

Finally, a little green ink at number 25…

Like all things crypto price related, it isn’t clear what is driving the changes.

A Bloomberg report yesterday suggested that China is preparing to block domestic internet users accessing international bitcoin exchanges. The country banned Chinese exchanges and ICOs last year.

Last week, it emerged that the central government is working to drive out China’s bitcoin miners, who are thought to account for the majority on the planet. Many of the bigger names are already expanding overseas in preparation but the news jolted the market.

There’s also been plenty of speculation around Korea’s plans to regulate crypto, although the government has since clarified it doesn’t plan an all-out ban on bitcoin and crypto trading.

Crypto being crypto, there are some alternative theories, too.

We’ve been here before, of course — the headline to this story may seem familiar….

The crypto market suffered huge loses right before Christmas last month although most valuations had recovered since, such is the volatile nature of the space. That could yet happen following today’s slump. Indeed, some financial market watchers predicted prices could jump this week as Wall Street bankers collect their bonuses.

The majority of crypto markets appear to have regained correlation with bitcoin, with BCH, ETH, LTC, DASH and many other major markets dumping in unison with BTC. For bitcoin, today’s retrace down to test the $11,000 USD line comprises the sixth consecutive day that BTC has lost value after testing the $20,000 area, whereas BCH is experiencing its second days of retracement following its dramatic establishment of new record highs at the $4,000 area.

Bitcoin Loses +40% in 1 Week

Bitcoin has continued to dump in recent days, with the BTC markets having now experienced its sixth consecutive day of retracement following the establishment of new all-time highs just below the $20,000 area on multiple major exchanges.

As of this writing, the BTC markets are trading above $12,200 after having found structural support at the $11,200 area – comprising a full retrace of the bull run that started from the 10th of December. Bitfinex experienced loss of approximately 40% percent – dropping from a high of $19,891 on the 17th of December to test a local floor of $11,000 today. Bitstamp’s price dropped by approx. 40%, falling from $19666 to a low of $11,160.

Looking at the weekly chart, the bearish week has comprised a test of the 61.8 Fibonacci retracement area when measuring from July’s $1,800 breakout area. The recent slump has also dragged the weekly stochastic RSI below the 80 thresholds for the first time since early November.

Bitcoin Cash Retraces by 61% in Two Days

BCH has also experienced a significant loss in value, pulling back by approximately 61% in two days before bouncing off the $1570 area when paired against the U.S. dollar on Bitfinex. The considerable retracement has followed BCH’s recent dramatic spike that established a new all-time high of approximately $4,110 – after the market gained approximately 130% in just three days. BCH is currently trading for roughly $2000.

Altcoin Markets Regain Correlation With Bitcoin

Following this recent price action in which scores of altcoins set new all-time highs against the dollar, many major altcoin markets have seen retracements of a comparable percentage to that experienced by bitcoin in recent days.

Litecoin established a new high of almost $370 on December 19, before retracing by approximately 45% over the course of following days, to establish a local floor of roughly $200 this morning. LTC is currently trading for approximately $210.

After setting a new record high of approximately $860 on the 17th of December, Ethereum has since pulled back, with bearish momentum accelerating to reach an approximately 30% retrace from the all-time high to test and break the $600 area. ETH is currently trading for approximately $570.

Dash established a record high of $1600 on the 20th of December, and has since witnessed losses of approximately 40% – culminating in a test of $930 area. Dash has since bounced, with prices hovering at approximately $1100 for a while, then dropping again.

Ripple have continued to gain against bitcoin – with XRP establishing a new all-time high of roughly $1.35 after gaining by more than 100% in the last 2 days. Ripple was first consolidating just below the $1.00 USD at $0.96 after experiencing a 40% retracement down to the $0.80 area earlier this morning, later dropping back below $0.80.

With over $12M in sales, CryptoKitties provides the low barrier to entry that will pave the way for markets featuring more expensive digital collectables and artworks. The rise of trendy crypto collectables like Cryptokitties, CryptoPunks, and Rare Pepe will seed the market with crypto-savvy consumers ready to buy.

Blockchain Democratizes Fine Art Investment

If you fancy yourself a ""serious"" collector of blue-chip art, perhaps you are thinking the blockchain is only about $11.00 digital drawings and cartoon cats and punks. Think again.

In 2018, the company Maecenas will be launching the first open blockchain platform that democratizes access to fine art. Now people who have always dreamed of owning famous paintings can buy shares in a Picasso, Warhol, Monet, etc. On the flipside, galleries, museums, and collectors can offer up works from their collection for bid on Maecenas to raise money for the purchase of future works (while leaving their collection intact). This may sound like a regular art fund, but remember that blockchain cuts out the middleman, greatly reducing the transaction costs. The transaction cost with blockchain is so low that Maecenas can theoretically let you invest as little as fractions of a penny using cryptocurrency without taking the hit of transaction fees. Maecenas shares the use case below on their website. It does a nice job of illustrating the savings that occur with using blockchain versus traditional transactions.

""A Gallery wants to acquire a $3M piece to expand its Warhol collection. Instead of getting a three-year art-secured loan at 13.5% annual interest, it can raise funds from Maecenus investors by listing some of their artwork at a 6% one-off fee. This represents a saving of over $400k in fees for the gallery.""

Great for the gallery, but what about the investors? The investors also benefit from the magic of blockchain. Because fees and the cost of transactions goes dramatically down with blockchain, and cryptocurrency can be infinitely divided, Maecenus can transform artworks valued at tens of millions of dollars into tiny digital units that can be easily bought and sold in real time: essentially a stock market for art, but with far less friction or fees.

I am a huge fan of the model because it capitalizes on so many aspects of what makes blockchain so powerful opens up fine-art investing to everyone. My friends and family should expect fractional shares in blue chip art for many birthdays and Christmases to come.

Blockchain Reduces Art Forgery with Improved Authentication, Verification, and Provenance

Perhaps the most obvious use of blockchain (and closest to my heart) is to fight art forgery through the establishment of better authentication and provenance. Since at its core the blockchain is a distributed ledger, it can provide an unalterable record of provenance starting with authentication and ending with the current owner of an artwork.

Verisart certifies and verifies artworks and collectibles using the Bitcoin blockchain. They are fighting art forgery by providing an ""airtight"" authentication methodology that allows for real time verification of artworks using distributed ledger and image-recognition technology. Their initial target market is authentication for living, working artists. In the long run, they plan on moving toward authenticating older works by working with artists' estates eventually having the provenance for every artwork in their blockchain. (Shameless self-promotion here: If they are in need of a large database of data from catalogue raisonné, I may know someone who can help them out…)

Beyond fighting forgery and theft, blockchain has the potential to protect and support artists by introducing new methods of monetizing their work. Artlery is building the world's ""first currency ever to be explicitly backed by the creation, exhibition, and appreciation of art,"" which they call CLIO, named after the muse of history. The CLIO is designed to support the creators of art, and artists can secure a spot in the initial offering by uploading their portfolios here: artlery.com/artists

How do I Get Involved with the Blockchain Art Market?

My recommendation would be to start simple. Get your feet wet with something as silly as a CryptoKitty, or better yet, support my new friends at DADA.nyc and buy some affordable, unique digital art - I promise you their gratitude will make you feel good about it and you’ll want to buy more. Once you have your MetaMask and Coinbase accounts set up and have your head around how the transactions work, you will be ready to invest in microshares of a Monet or a Picasso when Maecenas goes live in 2018.

For artists, I'd strongly recommend looking into a service like Verisart or Ascribe to protect and monetize your work. I’ve spent the last three years building an analytical art database of known works for our most important artists because I find the current vulnerability of our artistic record to fakes and forgeries deeply depressing. If current artists leverage blockchain technology to authenticate and track their works, we will have a clean, unalterable record of their artworks and can avoid posthumously piecing together a record of their work in a catalogue raisonné. For this reason alone, blockchain may be the most important technology to ever hit the art market.

Update: Many have asked how to tokenize their own art and launch a blockchain art marketplace. We have outlined this in a new article titled Blockchain 3.0 - How to Launch Your Own Blockchain Art Market.

2018-01-09 00:00:00+00:00	4 Cryptocurrencies That Could Surpass Bitcoin	['Sean Williams']	"Historically, the stock market has been the greatest creator of long-term wealth, with an average annual gain, inclusive of dividend investment and adjusted for inflation, of 7%. This would imply the opportunity for invested funds to double in value about once every decade.

However, cryptocurrency investors have laughed their way to the bank over the past year, with virtual currency valuations going through the roof. When 2017 began, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies combined was just $17.7 billion. By Jan. 4, 2018 (369 days later), the combined market cap of all 1,384 investable cryptocurrencies had soared to $774 billion. That's an increase in value of close to 4,300%, and it's a return the broad-based stock indexes would take decades to deliver.

Objects in the rearview mirror are getting closer

Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, and the digital coin accepted by more merchants than any other virtual currency, is often credited with being the impetus for this rally. After all, bitcoin was the first to bring blockchain technology -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underlies cryptocurrencies -- into the mainstream, and was the first actively traded digital currency on decentralized exchanges.

But, truth be told, the rally in recent months has been about far more than just bitcoin. In fact, bitcoin's dominance in relation to the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap is about as low as it's ever been at 34%, suggesting that the valuations of other virtual coins are growing at a much quicker pace than bitcoin's. In fact, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies, excluding bitcoin, has jumped from $2.24 billion on Dec. 31, 2016 to $522 billion as of Jan. 4, 2018, according to CoinMarketCap.com. That's a better than 23,200% increase in just over a year's time.

The search for the next bitcoin has investors and speculators pushing a number of digital currencies higher. However, only four, in my opinion, currently have the ""tools"" needed to surpass bitcoin's market cap in the intermediate term.

The two likeliest candidates to surpass bitcoin

Two of the likeliest cryptocurrencies to surpass bitcoin's market cap are Ethereum and/or Ripple, which just so happen to be third and second, respectively, in cryptocurrency market cap at the moment.

Ethereum

What makes Ethereum so special is its blockchain, and the number of organizations currently testing out that blockchain technology in some capacity. Ethereum's digital ledger incorporates protocols known as ""smart contracts,"" which help to verify, facilitate, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. Smart contracts are particularly attractive from an efficacy and legal standpoint for businesses, which is why the Ethereum Foundation has had little issue finding takers to test out its technology. Ethereum's blockchain also moves beyond bitcoin's currency-only applications, which is why so many different industries are interested in what Ethereum has to offer.

In February, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was formed, and by Oct. 18, 2017, exactly 200 organizations from a variety of industries were testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in small-scale and pilot projects. This includes a number of brand-name companies, as well as governments. If we begin to see wider acceptance of the Ethereum blockchain in real-world applications (i.e., beyond pilot projects), there's a real chance it could surpass bitcoin's market cap.

Ripple

Ripple might even be a bigger threat to bitcoin, with the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin needing only to double once more in order to surpass it.

Like Ethereum, all eyes are on Ripple's blockchain technology, which is being specifically targeted at big banks and financial institutions. Ripple's exceptionally low transactions fees and quick settlement times are designed to be a major upgrade over the long-winded verification process payments go through with the traditional banking system.

Though Ripple announced in June 2016 that seven large banks would be testing out its blockchain technology in a limited capacity, it really gained notoriety in November 2017 when American Express (AXP 1.24%) and Banco Santander (SAN 0.82%) announced their intention to use Ripple's blockchain in a real-world test. The partnership will allow U.S.-based American Express users who send non-card payments to U.K. Santander accounts to have those payments processed through Ripple's blockchain. It's believed that these transactions will settle instantly, which is far quicker than what happens with current cross-border transactions, where the verification process can take days.

Ripple has also benefited from rumors surrounding its presumably inevitable listing on Coinbase, the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchange. Assuming it does get listed soon and manages to snag new banking partners, it could give bitcoin a real run for its money.

Two dark-horse candidates that could really surprise and surpass bitcoin

There are also two dark-horse candidates that could do exactly what Ripple has done and emerge from the shadows to make a run at bitcoin.

Stellar

As with Ripple and Ethereum, Stellar's blockchain technology is the star. Stellar's blockchain offers quick processing times on its network of between two and five seconds for most transactions, which again would be a major improvement over the extended verification times often seen in cross-border payments.

Stellar's blockchain also incorporates its own version of smart contracts. Again, Stellar is making it clear that its blockchain is designed for enterprise customers and targeted at cross-border scalable applications.

But unlike Ripple and its laser focus on big banks, Stellar is approaching its search for scalability by seeking out multinational businesses. In October, IBM (IBM 1.22%) and KlickEx partnered with Stellar to facilitate cheaper and quicker cross-border transactions in the South Pacific region. This partnership involves a dozen international banks, representing multiple different currencies, developing and deploying Stellar's blockchain. The idea here being that IBM, which generates tens of billions of dollars each year outside the U.S., can receive payments from customers and have those payment process almost instantly, instead of waiting days for them to settle.

Assuming this project proves fruitful for IBM, ""Big Blue"" could choose to expand its application to other parts of the world. This is Stellar's chance to shine, and if it does, it may have a shot at garnering new partnerships and toppling bitcoin in the process.

Monero

Though it's the smallest of the four at the moment, with a market cap that's almost $250 billion behind that of bitcoin, Monero has the potential to really turn heads and supplant bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency.

Why Monero, you ask? Look no further than the tremendous surge in interest for privacy coins of late. A privacy coin is nothing more than a virtual currency that's placed an increased emphasis on the privacy and anonymity of the sender and receivers of virtual funds.

Many cryptocurrency users falsely believe that because their logged data is stored in an encrypted fashion on a digital ledger that it can't be traced back to them -- but this just isn't true. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service recently won a legal battle against Coinbase that required the cryptocurrency exchange to turn over information on 14,355 users who'd exchanged more than $20,000 worth of bitcoin between 2013 and 2015. Though the IRS's legal win was for the purpose of catching capital-gain tax evaders, the broader theme here is that blockchain transactions often aren't as anonymous as you'd think.

Monero employs an open-sourced protocol known as CryptoNote that uses ring signatures to obscure the sender of a payment. Ring signatures are akin to having multiple signers on a joint bank account, but without knowing who the official signer is. Each transaction on Monero's blockchain generates a one-time spend key known as a stealth address that allows only the recipient to detect and spend those funds.

If privacy coins remain popular among cryptocurrency investors, and Monero lands a major partner, it could come out of nowhere to leapfrog bitcoin."
2018-01-17 00:00:00+00:00	Here are all the theories explaining the crypto market crash	['Oscar Williams-Grut']	"The cryptocurrency market has lost $340 billion of value since the start of January, with a severe sell-off on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

Analysts are variously blaming: concerns about regulation, light trading volumes in Asia, bitcoin futures, and an unsustainable price run-up.

Expect the volatility to continue this year, experts say.



LONDON — Bitcoin dropped below $10,000 on Wednesday, almost 50% below its December peak, as the cryptocurrency market entered the second day of a major sell-off.

Almost all major cryptocurrencies fell on Tuesday and the market slump has extended into Wednesday. The combined value of the more than 1,400 cryptocurrencies in circulation has now fallen from over $800 billion at the start of January to around $460 billion at Wednesday lunchtime, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.com.

The causes for the sell-off are far from clear, with several theories making the rounds. Here's a roundup of what analysts and market participants are saying:

Worries about a regulatory crackdown

The most popular theory among market commentators is that fears about a regulatory crackdown in Asia are driving the sell-off.

Fiona Cincotta, an analyst with City Index, said in an email on Wednesday: ""The sell off comes amid concerns of fresh crackdowns on virtual currencies by the South Korean and Chinese government and as governments across the globe are struggling as how best to regulate bitcoin.""

Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst with Forex.com said in an email on Wednesday: ""Cryptos have been held back in recent days amid increasing levels of scrutiny from regulators, most notably in South Korea, where the government is planning to clamp down on trading in virtual currencies.

""The justice ministry is apparently working on a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges. If the bill is eventually passed by the National Assembly it would be very bad news given that South Korea is the world’s third-largest market for cryptocurrencies. The uncertainty is weighing on investor sentiment.""

FXPro said in its daily client email on Tuesday: ""The market seems overwhelmed by rumours regarding a complete currency ban in South Korea and the prohibition of mining in China due to high electricity consumption. What’s more, it was today reported that Chinese financial authorities plan to block domestic access to cryptocurrency trading platforms.""

Asian volumes tailing off

Investors are already getting a taste of what a market without South Korean activity could look like and this may also be playing a role in the cryptocurrency ""bloodbath.""

Mati Greenspan, an analyst with trading platform eToro, told Business Insider on Tuesday that volumes from Japan and South Korea had been tailing off in recent days. Traders in these markets are usually buyers and a large scale exit could have created an imbalance in the market, with more sellers than buyers driving down prices and sparking a panic.

""As we noted yesterday, there's been a trend from South Korea and Japan of lower volumes these last few weeks,"" Greenspan said in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""That did indeed come up a bit yesterday but is still nowhere near what it was in November/December.""

The Bitcoin futures theory

Greenspan provided the below graphs showing how Korean won bitcoin volume has recently declined:And a similar chart showing the same trend with Japanese yen bitcoin buying:Greenspan said the pickup in volumes on Tuesday shows ""that the two countries, especially Japan, are indeed starting to nibble at the lower prices. Indeed, the premiums have also come down a bit and price in the top two cryptotrading countries are now more normal compared to the rest of the world.""

Perhaps the wildest theory for what is driving the cryptocurrency crash is that the maturing of the first bitcoin futures contracts to blame.

Cboe and CME Group both introduced bitcoin futures contracts in mid-December, allowing institutional investors such as hedge funds to speculate on the future price of the digital currency.

The first bitcoin contracts, which are cash-settled, matured on Wednesday, January 17. The contract's settlement price is determined by a price auction on the Gemini exchange at 4 p.m. on Tuesday and some people are speculating that aggressive selling activity could have been used to drive down the price of bitcoin on the exchange to turn the futures contracts into winning bets.

""Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that as little as a million dollars could be used to shore up futures positions and influence the auction market,"" said EthNews.com's Matthew Da Silva, who reported on the theory.

CNBC, which also floated the idea , reported that Cboe's January 17 maturing bitcoin futures were priced at $10,000 on Tuesday afternoon, meaning that holders, in theory, had an incentive to push the price down by selling bitcoins they may have held as a hedge.

A popular Reddit thread has sprung up floating this idea, saying a sudden drop in the bitcoin price could have spooked the market.

""It's always fun to spin these types of stories but personally I don't buy into it,"" Greenspan told Business Insider.

""Number one, the entire market crashed, not just bitcoin. All the altcoins plummeted as well and Wall Street only has access to the bitcoin futures, which is fairly disconnected from bitcoin itself and certainly from the likes of Litecoin and Dash.

""Second point, the volumes that have been traded on these futures contracts are not sufficient to move the markets.""

Greenspan said that the total trade of Cboe's January 17 bitcoin contracts was around $1 billion in the month since they launched.

""Daily market volume on bitcoin is today $14.5 billion,"" he said. ""$1 billion over the course of a month, I don't think is going to tickle anything.""

Thomas Bertani, the CEO of cryptocurrency wallet company Eidoo, which has its own cryptocurrency, agreed with Greenspan. Bertani told BI: ""It might have played a role, but those price movements are all but new.""

A correction that was a long time coming

Bertani thinks the biggest factor driving the crash is the market overheating. Bitcoin rose by over 200% between October and December of last year as huge numbers of new investors poured cash into the sector.

Other cryptocurrencies rose alongside bitcoin and many market watchers argued that this created unsustainable bubble-like market conditions. The recent crash is just some of the air coming out of the bubble, Bertani argues.

Pawel Kuskowski, the CEO of Coinfirm. Coinfirm

""The last year has seen once again a massive growth and hype cycle (like it did already several times before) which needs to go back to normal after the current hype has reached its peak,"" he said. ""This is most likely what is going on now.

""The hypothesis of South Korea banning cryptocurrencies, more than a driving factor, is really just an excuse for the market to rest down for a little bit before continuing with its continuous growth.""

Pawel Kuskowski, the CEO and founder of Coinfirm, which provides cryptocurrency compliance services, told Business Insider on Wednesday: ""It's a correction, a long-expected correction.

""It was just for too long going up and up and up. Ether, in two months, went up from $300 to $1,300. That's absurd. Just crazy.

""I think there are some positions that are being closed at the moment but I don't think it's going to be a big negative impact. The correction was quite needed because it was just absurd what was happening.""

Expect more volatility

While Kuskowski doesn't expect any long-term negative impact to the sector from the currency sell-off, he does think that we are likely to see more of this type of volatility for the foreseeable future.

""I think it's going to stabilise probably not this year but probably within three or four years,"" he told BI. ""You're going to have more checks and balances. But in principle it's going to be a crazy world for another one year, two years, that's for sure. You're going to see more and more volatility, but then it's stabilisation.""

Christopher Keshian, managing partner and cofounder of Apex Token Fund, agreed, saying in an email: ""The volatility of bitcoin — and other cryptocurrencies — is an expected, and important, part of the journey to becoming a mature asset class.

""We expect the volatility to continue throughout 2018 but fundamentally believe that bitcoin is still in a bull market."""

The January 2018 futures contract is trading close to its earlier highs, at around $18,300. That’s up from an opening price of $15,000, and ahead of the ‘spot’ price - which is closing in on $17,000 tonight. Here’s the situation in Chicago: Bitcoin futures today Photograph: Cboe



11 Dec 2017 19.16 CBOE CEO Edward Tilly Photograph: Bloomberg TV Edward Tilly, chairman and chief executive officer at Cboe Global Markets, has spoken to Bloomberg TV about the bitcoin futures launch today. Tilly says it has been “business as usual”, with more than 3,000 bitcoin contracts sold on Cboe as market participants get up and running. Apparently there were just 12 registered traders involved with the bitcoin futures market at launch - that has risen to 22 during the trading day. That’s a fairly small pool of traders, frankly, given all the interest in digital currencies. I suspect major investors are treating bitcoin cautiously today, as they watch events unfold....



11 Dec 2017 18.28 Just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you should do, right? That mantra applies to bitcoin futures trading as much as anything else. So before you take the plunge, check out Bloomberg’s eight-point list of stuff you need to know: Here’s a flavour: 5. What are the risks? Not everyone thinks derivatives based on bitcoin are ready for prime time. One worry is the volatility that so far has been a key feature of the digital currency market. Just three days before Cboe’s product was slated to be introduced, bitcoin had one of its wildest sessions ever: On Coinbase’s GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes, before crashing back down. 6. So are bitcoin futures a bad idea? Some big traders think futures may be premature. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. In an open letter to the exchanges, the group questioned whether they would be able to adequately police market manipulation in bitcoin. The group said the exchanges should have sought more industry feedback on margin levels, trading limits and stress tests for the system before beginning trading. Cboe and CME are requiring traders to set aside an unusually large pile of cash to serve as collateral to back purchases. The full article is online here.

Updated at 18.00 GMT

11 Dec 2017 17.14 Naeem Aslam of Think Markets reckons the launch of bitcoin futures has gone pretty smoothly - even though only a few thousand contracts have actually been sold so far today. There are nearly 2900 contracts which have traded for the month of January which by no means can be classified as an anaemic volume but not exactly explosive either. The thought that comes to mind is that the Bitcoin’s spot and futures markets seem stable for now and things are looking much calmer. The spread between the February and January contract has narrowed to $150 which at one point was as high as $2000. This confirms that the volatility has eased off massively and in the coming days, we would not be shocked if the margin requirements are even lowered and the transaction cost reduced.



11 Dec 2017 16.17 By its recent standards, bitcoin has been notably stable today. The digital currency has been trading around at $16,300 mark for most of the day, a gain of around 10%. The futures contract has been more volatile, though: Looks as if #Bitcoin Options have tamed the Crypro-Beast, at least in the last 7hours. pic.twitter.com/g1DArsyjd0 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) December 11, 2017



11 Dec 2017 16.13 “Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, “It might have been.” The good news - I discovered I started a bitcoin wallet four years ago.

The bad - I didn't put any bitcoin in it. — Steve Goldstein (@MKTWgoldstein) December 11, 2017 Still, it’s only money, eh?



11 Dec 2017 16.09 Reuters’ Richard Beales has calculated that the volume of bitcoin future contracts actually traded today is quite modest. He writes: The one-month future surged more than 20 percent from the open before trading below $18,000 on Monday morning – still a premium to the crypto-currency itself. Considering the price of bitcoin has risen two-thirds this month alone, that seems fairly sedate. Volume was roughly $50 million, Breakingviews calculates, less than 0.5 percent of actual bitcoin trading in the prior 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.com. But the market could develop fast, as the CME exchange plans to rival CBOE by launching its own futures trading next Monday. Beales adds: Proponents reckon the entry of two big, regulated U.S. exchanges bolsters the legitimacy of bitcoin. It certainly broadens the universe of possible investors, and it invites the creation of new exchange-traded funds, which need a liquid benchmark to track. That would bring bitcoin exposure to retail investors. Yet the Futures Industry Association, which represents clearing houses and big banks, is apprehensive about the light regulatory scrutiny so far. And making the contracts cash-settled means the exchanges – and their customers – can now ride the bitcoin bandwagon without touching the crypto-currency at all.

Why the massive drop in cryptocurrency prices? Well, there have been massive stories that the Chinese government will be banning Bitcoin mining in the country, and with 80% of Bitcoin mined in China, this is huge on its own. But then news broke a couple of hours ago from Reuters that the South Korean government was pushing laws in to ban cryptocurrency trading on SK exchanges.

This has seen the drop of virtually every single cryptocurrency, with Ethereum going from its record high of $1400+ to $1230 in a matter of hours.

The total value of cryptos has crested the $600 billion mark, boasting massive appreciation since the start of the year when the same asset group was worth a more modest $18 billion or so, according to industry watcher CoinMarketCap.

The explosion in crypto value has been nothing short of staggering. And as with any movement in technology, crypto has attracted a host of morons, fraudsters, thieves, and boosters.

Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter & Facebook

It’s even managed to attract the attention of public companies. No, not Microsoft doing blockchain on Azure or IBM doing whatever this is. Instead, public companies that lack public attention are slathering themselves with a thin patina of crypto in hopes of attracting a market spike.

Think of it like smearing yourself in shit to attract flies.

And they are getting what they want. To understand how public investors could be so easily hoodwinked by hokum, let’s rewind the clock to a different time in which tech also lost its mind.

What Was This Dotcom Thing?

At one point, the Internet was new, and it was a thing, and everyone wanted to know about the thing and do the thing for good reason. If you were a thing-focused company, which is to say some sort of Internet-related entity, you were worth more. Instantly.

It’s something like tech-like companies arguing for tech-like revenue multiples in the current cycle; however, in the early 2000’s, it was more flagrant and the effects were far larger. (For a deeper look at the climate of those times, the rude F’d Companies is a good place to start.)

How silly did things get back around 2000? Quite silly. Famously silly, really, as this 2003 piece that references the 2000-era dotcom boom makes plain:

Back during the bubble years, companies were seeing their stock prices shoot up if they simply added an “e-” prefix to their name and/or a “.com” to the end. Call it “prefix investing.” There were also more than a few stories of companies having their stock prices driven up after a similarly named company had some good news happen.

But that’s just an overview of how weird the market got back when AOL wasn’t yet a punchline. Let’s look at a single example of how far from fundamentals the market managed to get itself back when Harry Potter wasn’t a complete set.

Here’s a piece from 2000 that includes one hell of a narrative arc:

Perhaps the most amazing stock of the year was Xcelera.com, formerly known as Scandinavia. Once a closed-end fund specializing in Scandinavian stocks, and then an operating company that owned a hotel in the Canary Islands, it made a small investment in an Internet company last year. Before it disclosed that investment, the family of Alexander Vik, the company’s chief executive, was given options to buy a million shares of stock, at a price of $3.25 each. The shares ended 1998 at $3.75, or $1.25 adjusted for two subsequent splits. They ended 1999 at $139.50, an increase of 11,060 percent. The Viks’ option position is now valued at $415 million.

Read that again, as it is incredible.

In short, if you were an Internet company, or you became a company that could lay title to any portion of the word “Internet,” your share price would rise.

That should sound familiar.

Bitcoin Goes Dotcom 2.0

As the saying goes, all this has happened before and will happen again. Such is the case with extant public companies and the bitcoin boom.

Some investors cannot, it turns out, buy bitcoin directly. So they may hunt for alternative investments that can provide exposure to the asset class. That makes public companies that work with bitcoin, and blockchain technologies more broadly, extra appealing to some.

That’s the theory behind why an already-public company that works with blockchain tech might fairly rise in value.

But as the dotcom examples detailed, not everyone who rides a particular boom really deserves to do so. Some companies, in contrast, spray paint themselves purple and then claim to be a tulip.

That’s what we are seeing today. For example, one company called Riot Blockchain is having a great few months, as The Street reports. Its shares are up “over 600% since early September, and […] about 250% since mid-November.”

But The Street has the rest of the terrifying story:

The funny thing is, until a few months ago, Riot had nothing at all to do with Bitcoin or blockchain technologies. The company was a struggling micro-cap biotech firm named Bioptix Inc. — one that had seen layoffs in January and a CEO change in April, and was trying to commercialize medical diagnostics instruments and IP related to a technology called Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance (eSPR). Then, on Oct. 4, Bioptix announced it’s changing its name to Riot Blockchain and disclosed a “strategic investment” — later said to be a 12% stake obtained for $3 million — in Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare.

That’s not so good. But this is hardly the only example we can point to.

There’s this December Bloomberg headline: “Bitcoin Fever Makes Pot Stocks Yesterday’s News in Canada.” Or, well, this other December Bloomberg headline: “This Mining Company Soared 159% After Saying It’s Buying a Crypto Firm.” And just for kicks, here is another December Bloomberg headline: “A Small Fintech Stock Surged 2,400% in a Week After Announcing It’s a Crypto Company.”

But don’t think that it’s only Bloomberg on the beat. Hell, even former apparel companies are getting in on the fun.

One example from CoinTelegraph stood out as well. Reported earlier this quarter, On-Line Plc, which had “been listed in London since 1996,” recently told the world that it was changing its name to Blockchain Plc. The company indicated to the public that it had been working on blockchain tech “for some time.”

The result? CoinTelegraph has the damage:

The decision of the Company to change its name provided a boost to the share price, resulting in the Company gaining 19% on Thursday. This turned out to be pretty insignificant, compared to what happened on Friday. The share price of the Company increased by 400%, from 17p the previous day to 84p. Shares closed the day at 46.50p, a 173% gain over the previous day’s close. The volume traded on Friday was multiple times the yearly trading volume of the Company.

Yes, an audible sigh is perfectly fine at this juncture.

This Is Stupid

The same silliness that took hold in the dotcom era is now repeating itself in the current moment, with “dotcom” scratched out and replaced with “HODL.”

Perhaps every real technological boom demands a period of excess. Certainly, the dotcom bust didn’t lead to the Internet extinguishment. And the slate-computing crash didn’t preclude the iPhone. But we’re past the moment when things merely looked a bit overheated in crypto.

Recall that $600 billion number? Folks are buying into crypto the boom with money they don’t even have, as venture capitalist Mark Suster recently made plain:

It wasn’t too long ago that it was said, in defense of the current tech bubble, that when it went bang, it wouldn’t harm normal people. After all, most of the value that would be deleted in a correction was locked up in private companies that your parents could not invest in. Well, now you can get your family hooked on crypto instead.

And if crypto undergoes the sort of correction, regular people can now get hurt. Just like before.

2017-12-19 09:20:00+00:00	Crypto-Derivatives: New Products, for New Participants in the Futures and Swaps Markets	[]	"The CFTC and exchanges are likely to be particularly vigilant for prohibited activity and abusive trading behavior in the new crypo-currency derivative market. Accordingly, firms trading these products must understand how the futures and swaps markets are regulated – this is particularly true for firms with little or no experience operating in the highly-regulated derivatives markets.

Implications for Bitcoin Market Participants

Bitcoin futures and swaps are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC""). Although bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are a novel class of commodities, derivatives based on these products are regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act and rules of the CFTC and National Futures Association (""NFA"") just like all other derivative contracts. This has numerous immediate and practical implications for market participants: • Futures commission merchants – Any entity that solicits or accepts orders to buy or sell bitcoin futures or swaps and accepts money or assets from customers for such orders must register with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant. • Introducing brokers – Any entity that solicits or accepts orders for bitcoin futures or swaps but does not accept customer funds must register as an introducing broker. • Commodity trading advisors – Any entity that, for compensation or profit, advises others, directly or indirectly, as to the value of or the advisability of trading bitcoin futures or swaps must register as a commodity trading advisor. • Commodity pool operators – Any fund or collective investment vehicle that trades bitcoin futures or swaps is a commodity pool, the operator of which must register as a commodity pool operator. • Swap dealers – Any entity that holds itself out as a dealer in bitcoin swaps; makes a market in bitcoin swaps; regularly enters into bitcoin swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own account; or engages in more than a de minimis volume of bitcoin swaps as a dealer must register as a swap dealer. Exemptions from some or all of the regulatory requirements associated with each of these registration categories may be available depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each individual or firm.

Devil in the Details: Reference Price Calculations

Each bitcoin derivative contract attempts to accurately represent prices in the physical bitcoin market through the methodology defined in the contract specifications for calculating the reference price for its bitcoin contract. This calculation is the core commercial term of the contract because it determines whether the derivative will function as an effective and reliable proxy for a position in the physical market. However, this calculation also provides would-be market manipulators with instructions on how the reference price the futures and swaps contracts will be determined and, in theory, how those prices could be manipulated for their individual gain. Market participants should use particular care when trading in both bitcoin futures or swaps and related markets because this type of trading activity may give rise to heightened regulatory scrutiny.



CME uses the Bitcoin Reference Rate (""BRR""), calculated by CME together with Crypto Facilities Ltd. using aggregated trade flow from major bitcoin spot exchanges (Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit, and Kraken) during a 1-hour daily calculation window. CBOE uses the auction price for bitcoin on Gemini Exchange (another spot bitcoin exchange) as of the futures contract’s final settlement date. Cantor will determine its own reference price based on various factors, including publicly available bitcoin spot price sources, market analytics such as bitcoin price arbitrage matrices, and the Exchange’s own bids, offers, and traded prices.

“To make a ready-made we needed a signature, but we were no one in the art world,” Mr. Sarrouy said, adding that he and his friends had chosen Richard Prince “because he is the king of appropriation art.”

“Our artwork has been created by our own Richard Prince,” he said. “And then there is the famous Richard Prince.”

The appropriation of this name was certainly mischievous, given that the “famous” Richard Prince continues to be involved in a lawsuit concerning his appropriation of an Instagram-sourced photograph for a 2014 exhibition. Adding further confusion, Mr. Prince’s most recent show of paintings at the Gladstone Gallery was titled “Ripple,” which also happens to the name of a high-rising cryptocurrency.

Mr. Prince declined to comment for this column.

“The project is interesting,” said Judy Mam, an organizer of the Rare Digital Art Festival, referring to the Distributed Gallery’s Duchampian token. “But we’re talking about people who are putting up money,” she added. “That’s when the theoretical aspect of the project comes crashing down.” It no longer features in the festival program.

As of Wednesday, Distributed Gallery’s auction had attracted four participants, who bid in Ether up to a value of about $2,600. Three bidders who thought they were competing for a work by the “famous” Mr. Prince have received or are in the process of receiving a refund, according to Mr. Sarrouy. “The last one has bet knowing what this project was all about,” he said, “and is still the highest bidder.”"

Crypto Roller Coaster Continues: This week, the total market cap for all coins hit a new all-time high around $835 billion on January 7th and took a steep correction losing over $200 billion in a just a few days to land at $628 billion on January 11th. At the time of writing, the market has seemed to stabilize (as stable as something can be in the Wild West World of Crypto) around $718 billion.

Bitcoin: The flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin was down roughly -15% to a price of $14,000.00 this week.

Ethereum: Despite the violent twists and turns of the market, Ethereum went up 25.91% this week hitting an ATH of around $1400. It regained its number two spot from Ripple.

Ripple Knocked Down to 3rd Spot: Following an explosive few weeks of growth, Ripple took a major hit when CoinMarketCap removed South Korean exchanges from their listings, instantly dropping prices from ATH’s. Down 34.91% this week, Ripple saw some alleviation with the announcement of its partnership with MoneyGram.

Cardano: Currently in the 5th position, Cardano was trading at $0.80 at the time of writing. The altcoin took a major blow along with Ripple, decreasing 21.22% this past week.

Tron Takes a Tumble: The recent allegations against Tron along with the market being overall down affected Tron pretty hard, moving the currency from its short-lived number 6th spot to 13th. The currency is down 47.24% this week.

Binance Coin: Binance Coin (BNB) is up 72% in the last 7 days. The coin, owned by major exchange Binance, offers discounts for using the coin when trading for other currencies on its platform.

Alt-coin “Vibe” Increases more than 400% in A Single Day: Vibe, a live-music focused cryptocurrency, exploded in growth after it was added to the Binance exchange. The coin, currently trading around $1.40, created a major buzz after it sold out in under 5 minutes during its ICO phase.

Tron Accused Of Plagiarizing in Whitepaper: CEO of Tron Justin Sun has had a bumpy week after facing a string of allegations, which include accusations of selling off all his coins by Litecoin founder Charlie Lee (later resolved between the parties). To add insult to injury, Tron was accused of copying their whitepaper by the founder of BitTorrent client JoyStream.

Famous Wall Street Trader Mike Novogratz to Start Cryptocurrency Bank: Former Goldman Sachs Partner Mike Novogratz has been an avid supporter of blockchain for some time, and is now looking to take his stake in the industry to new heights. According to Bloomberg Markets, Galaxy Digital Holdings will be publicly listed in Canada and will build the “best-in-class, full service, institutional-quality merchant banking business in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space”.

Computer Vulnerability Causes Major Exchange Shut Down: This past Wednesday, Bittrex took many wallets offline to secure the safety of data within its platform. The flaws, primarily found in Intel chips that were created from 1995 and beyond, affects “pretty much everyone” who uses them to connect to the internet.

Telegram Wants to Raise More Than $1 Billion for ICO: Instant messaging service Telegram plans on launching the Telegram Open Network (Ton) cryptocurrency in the near future. With roughly 200 million users on the app, users will be able to make purchases with “grams” for such tools as concealed browsing and file sharing.

Brains & Brawn, NFL Superstar Richard Sherman Weighs in on Crypto: Cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks Richard Sherman says people need to do research and educate themselves when investing in cryptocurrency. He also lays out three major issues with cryptocurrency, including expensive trading fees, slow transaction times, and “skepticism” injuring the market’s potential for mass adoption. With more spare time off the field due to injury, Sherman looks to crypto to “stimulate [himself] mentally”.

Self-Proclaimed “Crypto Genius” James Atlucher to Launch Exchange: You may recognize James from your FB ads or in your newsfeed, trying to convince “average Joes to ride the crypto boom” by enrolling in his crypto courses. Also called the “Guru of Finance”, the author and podcast host is now looking to start an exchange called “Bitzumi”. According to Altucher, the company intends to compete with the likes of well-known exchanges such as Bitstamp and Coinbase.

Former Bankrupt Company Kodak to Launch ICO: A day after announcing the creation of “KodakCoin”, Kodak shares tripled in value. According to the Kodak website, the coin will allow photographers to “receive payment for licensing their work immediately upon sale, and sell their work confidently on a secure blockchain platform.”

Warren Buffett States Cryptocurrency Will “Come to a Bad Ending”: In a sea of speculation, it’s no wonder the generally conservative investor steers clear of cryptocurrencies. In a CNBC interview, Buffet exclaimed that cryptocurrency “is a mirage… the idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke”.

Cryptocurrency News from Around the World

NEO’s Founder Doesn’t Expect Stricter Government Regulations: NEO’s Founder Da Hongfei noted in an interview with Bloomberg that the Chinese government has already been very strict with cryptocurrencies in China, but does not expect stricter regulations coming.

North Korea Mining Ultra-Anonymous Monero: North Korea is at the cyber attack game again, this time hacking peoples computers to mine Monero through them. The currency, which is being funneled to a university in Pyongyang, is said to “provide a financial lifeline to a country hit hard by sanctions” by U.S. cybersecurity firm Alienvault.

China Threatens to Ban Mining: According to Fortune.com, China wants an “orderly exit” from cryptocurrency and is willing to limit miners electricity supply in order to do so. With mining being an integral part of cryptocurrency and China being the largest market for Bitcoin mining, such a move could have devastating effects on the industry at large.

Venezuela’s “Petro” Cryptocurrency Considered Illegal by Congress: According to the Venezuelan congress, the “Petro” coin is just another way for President Maduro to “illegally mortgage the cash-strapped country’s oil reserves.” The Congress also adds that issuing the digital currency disregards legislative authority to approve borrowing."

['Max Gulker', 'Get Notified Of New Articles Max Gulker']	"This article is based on the excellent research of Alexandra Emily, Benjamin Loeper, and Edward Koharik, under the supervision of their professor Dr. Ana Ichim and AIER staff.

The volatility of the Bitcoin/dollar exchange rate is frequently discussed in the media and often cited as the primary reason why Bitcoin does not currently function as a reliable store of value and medium of exchange, generally accepted requirements for something to count as a money. AIER collaborated with undergraduate students from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, through a fall-semester course followed by an intensive two-week program at AIER, to investigate various aspects of Bitcoin’s volatility and the determinants of its price. In the coming weeks, we will publish multiple articles summarizing our findings. The first article in this series focuses on work done by a group of students during the fall semester on the causes of Bitcoin’s largest daily changes in price.

If Bitcoin trades in an efficient market with enough buyers and sellers, theory holds, its price should reflect all publicly available information about it, and changes in price should reflect new information. However, Bitcoin might not yet meet this standard. First, if the number of market participants is relatively small, the idiosyncratic behavior of a few individuals may significantly impact the price. Second, there have been accusations of market manipulation by traders of Bitcoin. Third, many observers believe Bitcoin to be in a speculative bubble, which may or may not imply large price changes not driven by newly revealed information.

While the scope of the study does not extend to all daily changes in Bitcoin’s price, we focused on the largest daily changes in price from the beginning of 2016 through the end of November 2017. We found evidence largely consistent with Bitcoin’s largest price changes occurring on dates when significant or widely discussed new information about the cryptocurrency was revealed. This does not mean we consider the market for Bitcoin to be efficient; we do not directly study the size of these price changes, nor can we establish certain causality between the events and price changes in question. However, the fact that one can point to specific events coinciding with the largest changes in price suggests at least some degree of rationality in the market.

The table below summarizes the seven largest daily price changes of Bitcoin in terms of absolute value during the period in question. Each coincides with a new event or piece of information that investors may have found important.

The largest daily increase in Bitcoin’s price during the period occurred on July 20, 2017 (25.4 percent), when an agreement appeared to be reached regarding the scaling of Bitcoin’s blockchain-based payment system. The largest daily price decrease occurred on September 14, 2017, when the Chinese government announced plans to shut down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.

We also examined the 50 largest price changes in absolute value during the period, summarized in the table below. We categorized potential news events into eight categories: BS (change in structure of Bitcoin), PO (personal opinions), GR (government regulation), OC (other currencies), NI (new investment opportunities), UI (under investigation), CS (cybersecurity), and NF (nothing found). Of these categories, we found that news about changes in the structure of Bitcoin (such as scaling and potential forks) had the largest effect on the price. Looking closer at the dates for which we did not find news about Bitcoin itself, thus categorized NF, we found there were often news releases about changes in major currencies around the world, such as large inflation of the euro or increases in the value of the dollar. Large changes in the price of Bitcoin on those days might be explained by these events, or might be instances of price changes driven by smaller numbers of individuals, as discussed above.

While the nature of the news events does not necessarily explain the magnitude of Bitcoin’s price changes or its daily volatility, it does suggest that the market is not being driven entirely by manipulation or the behavior of small numbers of traders. In the next brief in this series on AIER’s collaboration with the Missouri University of Science and Technology, we will look directly at Bitcoin’s volatility and compare it with that of widely used currencies and other assets."
2017-12-04 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin and cryptocurrency on Twitter: The most important people to follow	['Jessica Marmor Shaw', 'Barbara Kollmeyer']	"It’s a new year, and for those of us in the newsroom who spend far too much time hunting tips, charts and RTs on Finance Twitter TWTR, +1.76% , that means one thing: time to update our annual list of who to follow.

Our 2016 edition was all about the names that might offer a heads-up on market tumult (remember when we were worried about that?!). For 2017, we put together a comprehensive list that, honestly, still stands for 2018. (A full roundup is available in one Twitter list right here.) This year... it’s all about crypto.

But before we dive head-first into the blockchain, we’ve been asking you, our readers, for 2018 nominees and a few of you spotted that we were under-representing accounts covering Asia. Here are a few of your nominees to correct that oversight: Comrade Balding @BaldingsWorld, managing director/chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management Patrick Chovanec @prchovanec, and the technical-analysis focused @Sunchartist.

From our newsroom, a few general tips: Author and never-Trumper Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) is an outspoken tweeter on politics with blistering retorts to those who claim their own facts. Check out Bama @Bamabroker if you’re looking for tweets about commodities. Investment advisor Ross Gerber @GerberKawasaki has racked up over 46,000 followers with his market following tweets. ValueWalk (@valuewalk) is a good all-arounder on hedge funds and value investing. And may we recommend WSJ Millennials @WizJourn — it’s as perfect as it sounds.

The 30 essential Crypto Twitter accounts to follow

Now let’s get down to it: 2017 was the year of the cryptocurrency. You know the story: Bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.67% exploded onto the scene this year with a 1,400% yearly gain (and plenty of volatility to go along with it). The total crypto market cap now stands at over $554 billion. Social chatter about the new asset class has blown up, and the followings of notable Crypto Twitter accounts have seen, well, crypto-like, 500%+ gains.

On this topic, EVERYONE has a differing opinion ranging from “fraud” to “the future” — and social media is often the place those opinions get aired and debated. Meanwhile, price moves happen quicker than you can tweet about it. For investors, sorting through the noise (not to mention the ICO pump and dumps) to find signals worth listening to is no easy thing.

Are cryptocurrencies a huge bubble, or just getting going? Is ether the next bitcoin? What’s the ideal crypto portfolio? Whatever your position, we hope these accounts will deliver the analysis and commentary you’re looking for in the year to come. (Who did we miss? Tell us in the comments below.)

VIPs and founders

Vitalik Buterin @VitalikButerin — AKA the “boy genius” of crypto — is a co-founder of decentralized cryptocurrency platform Ethereum. He’s Canadian/Russian and in his early twenties... and if you don’t know who he is it’s probably time to read this or this or this. Named to the Forbes 30 under 30 list. In January of 2017, Buterin had about 40,000 Twitter followers. Today, his following is over 514,000.

(For the story behind that tweet, go here.)

Charlie Lee@satoshilite is the creator of Litecoin and the ex-director of engineering at Coinbase. He’s active on Twitter, keeping up with every turn and hard fork in the road. He, too, has seen a massive follower growth in 2017 — from under 30K earlier this year to about 558,000 at latest check. He made headlines back in December for announcing he sold and donated his Litecoin stake to avoid conflicts of interest while overseeing the cryptocurrency’s growth.

Roger Ver@rogerkver claims to be the world’s first investor in bitcoin startups. He apparently used to be all about bitcoin, and now it’s Bitcoin Cash. Some would call him a little controversial.

Canadian entrepreneur Joseph Lubin @ethereumJoseph is another Ethereum co-founder, and founder of a blockchain software production studio called ConsenSys.

Barry Silbert@barrysilbert is the founder/CEO of Digital Currency Group and pink-sheet listed Bitcoin Investment Trust GBTC, -0.20% , the world’s first publicly traded bitcoin fund.

Gavin Andresen@gavinandresen was previously lead developer on Bitcoin Core, the original open source software created by Satoshi Nakamoto, and took over maintenance of the code directly from Nakamoto. He’s been called “the man who really built bitcoin,” and has drummed up a fair bit of controversy over the past few years.

His Fortress hedge fund shuttered after heavy losses, but Michael Novogratz @novogratz appears to be trying to reinvent himself as the “king of bitcoin.” If you’re looking for bold, bullish calls... you’ve found your guy. (Though that planned bitcoin hedge fund is no longer in the works, for the time being anyway.)

Andreas Antonopoulos@aantonop has been called a “primary thought-leader and ambassador on bitcoin” by CoinDesk and made their top list of influencers several times over, including a spot at No. 1 in 2014. He literally wrote the book on it (or one of them — “Mastering Bitcoin”) and he’s a frequent crypto conference headliner. His feed often points to explainers and how-tos on his YouTube channel:

Analysts

Alex Sunnarborg@alexsunnarborg, former research analyst at digital asset broker Coinbase is a founding partner at Tetras Capital, a hedge fund that focuses on diversified blockchain, crypto and digital assets. He’s also on CoinDesk’s list of top 10 traders and analysts. He’s good for charts, stats and more.

Spencer Bogart aka @CremeDeLaCrypto also makes that CoinDesk list, and was one of the first Wall Street analysts to focus on cryptocurrencies. He’s now a researcher for investment fund Blockchain Capital, and also shows up on Forbes with some stuff that’s written in layman’s terms.

One more from the CoinDesk list: Willy Woo @woonomic produces “some of the highest-quality and most creative charts in the industry.”

Author and commodity trader Peter Brandt @PeterLBrandt now also trades and offers commentary and charts on bitcoin. Extra points for his informative AMAs on Twitter, like this one.

Ronnie Moas@RonnieMoas, independent analyst and founder at Standpoint Research, is worth following just to see how high the bar is being set for bitcoin right now (He once said it’ll catch up with Apple’s AAPL, +3.28% market cap within five years). He does plenty of research to back up his calls. He’s not just into bitcoin, but you’re going to have to subscribe for that research.

Investors and miners

Wences Casares @wences was called the “Patient Zero for bitcoin in Silicon Valley” by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. He’s more of a retweeter than a tweeter. He’s also garnered some fame over this YouTube video — circa 2014 — that explained how bitcoin would get to a billion users.

Jameson Lopp@lopp is an engineer at blockchain security company BitGo and the author of this tweet that got passed around feverishly as bitcoin was hitting new highs mid-November:

Balaji S. Srinivasan @balajis is the CEO of Earn.com, formerly 21 Inc., a well funded blockchain startup that helps its users make money by creating public profiles for receiving paid messages, or completing small tasks. Like Twitter TWTR, +1.76% , but “you’re not just wasting time, you’re making money,” is how Srinivasan put it anyway (and CoinDesk has a writeup of what it’s all about here). Like most of the folks on this list, he’s got some pretty strong convictions about where this crypto thing is going:

Alvin Lee tweeting @onemanatatime describes himself as a veteran crypto trader and entrepreneur, blogging at Aluna Cyrpto blogspot. For example, in “Top 5 things cryptocurrency traders can learn from poker players,” he talks about how much you should really risk (the answer: a tiny percentage of your overall capital).

BTF%$D@CryptoHustle is a full-time crypto trader. On his website, he offers up a free masterclass on bitcoin. Over on Twitter, he’s got plenty to say on bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, market sentiment and swearword-laced, crypto-style philosophy:

@westcoastbill — Bill Lee is the founding chairman of BitGo and a Silicon Valley angel who has a lot of notable investments — Tesla TSLA, +5.78% , Space X, bitcoin and Coinbase.

@CharlieShrem: first bitcoin felon? Charlie Shrem, entrepreneur and early bitcoin advocate, did jail time for helping a customer get bitcoins to resell on the now-shuttered Silk Road. Shrem dusted himself off and is keeping pretty busy with a hand in all sorts of projects. He has no shortage of fans, with some 65,000 followers.

Linda Xie@ljxie is a Coinbase product manager and a good one to follow for explainers and news on alternate cryptocurrencies. She’s got beginner guides up on Bitcoin Cash, Monero and more, and points her followers to them, along with tips like these:

Blockchain tech

Jihan Wu @JihanWu is co-founder of BITMAIN, which has been called perhaps “the most influential company in the bitcoin economy by virtue of the sheer amount of processing power, or hash rate, that it controls.”

@starkness — Elizabeth Stark is the co-founder of @lightning, a so-called open protocol layer that leverages blockchains and smart contracts to “make cheap, fast, private transactions available to anyone around the world.”

Perianne Boring@PerianneDC is a blockchain advocate and founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Congress, which bills itself as a leading trade association representing blockchain. She’s also out to educate:

Nick Szabo@NickSzabo4 is a highly followed cryptographer and blogger, known as one of the pioneers of blockchain. He’s one to follow on issues of scalability and security.

Adam Back@adam3us, CEO of Blockstream, a big provider of blockchain technologies, and inventor of hashcash, the proof-of-work algorithm used in bitcoin mining. He seems pretty big on educating the public, and, well, his bio may make your head spin.

Commentary

Don’t let the fact that we’ve come this far in the list before getting to WhalePanda @WhalePanda deter you: this is pretty much a must-follow when it comes to crypto.

Chris Burniske@cburniske the author of “Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor’s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond” offers a balanced, if bullish, perspective on the crypto space with tweets that tend to be investor-focused and easy to get your head around for the newbies.

Investor and fintech/hard-money analyst Tuur Demeester @TuurDemeester is worth a follow if you’re interested in easy-to-read charts and a greater market perspective:

“Into crypto before it was cool,” is how Arianna Simpson — @AriannaSimpson — describes herself. She’s an early-stage investor in startups and also has held roles at BitGo and Facebook. She doles out all sorts of advice:

Plus a dozen more...

We’ve tried to offer up a curated list above of must-follow accounts that are consistently active, influential, and bring something unique to the table. But there are dozens (hundreds! thousands!) more out there, each offering up something slightly different. Here are a dozen more names, if the 30 we called out above aren’t enough for you.

Blockchain experts and advocates: Neha Narula @neha is the director of digital currency at MIT Media Lab; cryptography consultant Peter Todd @petertoddbtc; Meltem Demirors — @Melt_Dem — is a director at Digital Currency Group; Elizabeth Rossiello @e_rossiello hasn’t tweeted in awhile, but is founder of a blockchain payments startup. Luke Martin @VentureCoinist is one to follow for charts, and you might also add derivatives trader and consultant Tone Vays @ToneVays.

Other crypto big wigs: Fred Ehrsam @FEhrsam, previous Coinbase co-founder; Brian Armstrong @brian_armstrong, another Coinbase co-founder and its current CEO; Tony Gallippi @TonyGallippi is the co-founder and Executive Chairman of BitPay. NEO founder Da Hongfei @dahongfei, Jackson Palmer @ummjackson, creator of @dogecoin, could also make your follow list. The Winklevii accounts are nearly all RTs these days, but should you feel the need to follow the first reported bitcoin billionaires, they are @winklevoss and @tylerwinklevoss.

Yes, we undoubtedly missed some good ones. So let us know in the comments section which accounts you think are a must-follow."
