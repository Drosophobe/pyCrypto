It’s been a rocky start to the year for Bitcoin, but experts still say it will hit $100,000 — and that it’s more a matter of when, not if.

Bitcoin’s price surged above $23,000 on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve decided to take a more aggressive plan of action by raising interest rates by 0.75% and an economic report revealed the U.S. GDP fell for two consecutive quarters. The upward price movement suggests that investors were already expecting those two outcomes this week. The largest crypto is up more than 10% in the last 24 hours.

“The FOMC decision provided optimism that the end of tightening is in sight and that triggered a nice rally for risky assets that helped elevate cryptos,” says Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker Oanda. “A clear greenlight to buy up risky assets won’t happen until we see evidence inflation is coming down.”

Moya says Bitcoin is showing some signs of stabilizing lately, but the market may not be out of the danger zone yet. Bitcoin has fallen below $20,000 — a key price point — several times in recent weeks and the “majority of crypto watchers are still awaiting further weakness and possible retest of the June lows,” he says.

The latest crypto market crash in June was spurred by momentary de-risking from Wall Street as many investors are feeling pessimistic about the economy amid surging inflation, a shaky stock market, and rising interest rates. The crypto market has increasingly tracked the stock market in recent months, which makes it even more intertwined with global economic factors.

In addition to macroeconomic factors, Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at Uphold, says investors fear the crypto industry’s long-term viability after several major crypto players halted withdrawals, cut jobs, and tried to stem losses in recent weeks. However, crypto prices are much more vulnerable to factors contributing to the difficult economic situation than the pullback in the crypto ecosystem, he says.

“The market remains vulnerable and on edge, not necessarily by threats from more crypto projects going bust but from the difficult economic situation we are facing right now,” Hiesboeck says. “In other words, the price of bitcoin depends more on the supply of gas to Germany as it does in any crypto-related news or metric.”

With no end in sight, the war, inflation, and shifting monetary policy in the U.S. will likely continue to drive more volatility in the coming weeks and months, experts say.

Bitcoin has only been above $45,000 for a few short stretches over the past six months, and hasn’t been above $50,000 since Dec. 25, 2021. Amid the ups and downs, Bitcoin’s current price is a long way off from the latest all-time high it hit in November, when it went over $68,000. But even with the recent decline in price, Bitcoin is still more than twice as valuable as it was just a couple years ago. For Bitcoin, these kinds of ups and downs are nothing new.

One Week Ago (July 22) One Month Ago (June 29) 3 Months Ago (April 30) $23,155.21 $20,282.54 $38,650.55

Prices updated: July 29, 2022

Despite the volatility and recent slumping price, many experts still say Bitcoin is on its way to passing the $100,000 mark, though with varying opinions on exactly when that will happen. And a recent study by Deutsche Bank found that about a quarter of Bitcoin investors believe Bitcoin prices will be over $110,000 in five years.

The volatility is nothing new, and is a big reason experts say new crypto investors should be extremely cautious when allocating part of their portfolio to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has shown as steady a rise in value over the years as any other cryptocurrency on the market. It’s only reasonable for Bitcoin investors to be curious about how high it can ultimately go.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin’s price is extremely difficult to predict and even more susceptible to market factors than more established asset classes. But we decided to ask some experts for their best guesses anyway. Here’s what they said:

Bitcoin Price Predictions

It was easy to predict a $100,000 Bitcoin price late last year, coming off its latest all-time high in November. With Bitcoin’s big fall since then, the prediction game is even trickier.

The most extreme crypto skeptics say Bitcoin will tank to as low as $10,000 in 2022, but a middle ground might be to say the cryptocurrency can still climb to $100,000 like many experts predicted late last year — just on a slower timeline.

“The most knowledgeable educators in the space are predicting $100,000 Bitcoin in Q1 2022 or sooner,” Kate Waltman, a New York-based certified public accountant who specializes in crypto, told us back in November 2021.

But now, bullish experts are re-evaluating the crypto industry altogether as major corporations like Nike and other big brands are looking at ways to monetize their products in the digital metaverse. The rise of metaverse games, worlds, products, and experiences is increasing the popularity of altcoins, which has changed investors’ sentiments about Bitcoin (known as the original crypto).

Many experts are hesitant to predict a number and a date, but rather point to the trend of Bitcoin increasing its value over time. Investors should expect a “pretty sustainable” rise in Bitcoin’s long-term value driven by organic market movement, with the $100,000 threshold in near-sight, predicted Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, last October.

“What I expect from Bitcoin is volatility [in the] short-term and growth [in the] long-term,” says Kiana Danial, founder of Invest Diva and author of “Cryptocurrency Investing For Dummies.”

Here are some more predictions we found, ranked from low to high over the next year:

Point of View: Bitcoin investor and founder of crypto research and media company Token Metrics

Bitcoin investor and founder of crypto research and media company Token Metrics Prediction: Bitcoin can go to $100,000-$150,000, but the timeline is unclear

Bitcoin can go to $100,000-$150,000, but the timeline is unclear Why: Bitcoin is in a bearish sentiment cycle, but the total crypto market and other crypto asset classes are not. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but now others have surpassed it in innovation when it comes to what experts call “Web 3” — aka the new internet built on blockchain. The release of new altcoins and hype about the metaverse will continue to drive the demand for crypto, and Bitcoin will therefore bounce back eventually.

Technical analysis and blockchain data analyst Prediction: Bitcoin can reach $100,000 in 2022

Bitcoin can reach $100,000 in 2022 Why: The price of Bitcoin in January 2022 is almost equal to its price in January 2021, but there’s a new demand for altcoins. There’s also an ongoing trend of Bitcoin supply leaving major exchanges (presumably to be stored in offline crypto wallets), Hyland said in a tweet. He also recently tweeted that a dip below $40,000 could lead to “free fall” into a Bitcoin bear market.

Robert Breedlove

Point of View: Founder and CEO of the digital assets marketing and consulting firm Parallax Digital

Founder and CEO of the digital assets marketing and consulting firm Parallax Digital Prediction: $307,000 by October 2021 (now passed), and $12.5 million by 2031

$307,000 by October 2021 (now passed), and $12.5 million by 2031 Why: Inflationary pressures after COVID-19 will drive interest in cryptocurrency, pushing the value of Bitcoin up higher than previous projections estimated, Breedlove said in an interview earlier this year. Known as more of a philosopher type among crypto enthusiasts, Breedlove speaks often about the broader social implications of crypto as a form of more transparent, decentralized currency — but his price predictions haven’t exactly been spot-on.

Big financial institutions have made their own predictions, as well, with JPMorgan predicting a long-term high of $146,000 and Bloomberg predicting it could hit $400,000 if the currency climbs at rates comparable to the past.

Pro Tip Even if Bitcoin breaks $100,000, stay focused building on your overall portfolio including passive index funds, emergency savings, and your retirement account(s).

What Influences Bitcoin’s Price

Normal economic factors influence the price of cryptocurrency just like any other currency or investment — supply and demand, public sentiment, the news cycle, market events, scarcity, and more.

As a new and emerging asset, additional factors influence Bitcoin’s value more than the average currency or security. Here are some:

Scarcity

There are only 18 to 19 million Bitcoins currently in circulation, and minting will stop at 21 million. Industry experts consistently point to this built-in scarcity as a big part of cryptocurrency’s appeal.

“There’s a fixed supply but increasing demand,” says Alexis Johnson, president of the blockchain public relations and events company, Light Node Media.

Other experts point out Bitcoin has value because people give it value. “That’s really why everybody’s buying — because of the psychological aspect,” says Nelson Merchan, Johnson’s Light Node Media co-founder. That can make it difficult for the average consumer to discern whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are legitimate. The whole concept of supply and demand only works when people want something scarce — even if it previously didn’t exist.

“It actually does almost kind of seem like a scam,” Merchan says about Bitcoin’s origins. Though he says he’s seen his crypto holdings reach millions at times since he began investing in 2017, he’s also seen them disappear in an instant.

“I’m a big believer that if it’s not in cash, you don’t really have that money because in crypto, anything can drop dramatically overnight,” Merchan says. This is why certified financial planners suggest only allocating 1% to 5% of your portfolio to crypto — to protect your money from the volatility.

Mainstream Adoption

One of the main factors driving the price increase of Bitcoin is the rate at which new consumers are buying and exploring cryptocurrency, says Waltman.

“Crypto technology is being adopted at a faster rate than humans first adopted internet technology,” she says. Assuming it continues, the compounding acceleration of new adoption could keep pushing the value of Bitcoin higher and higher.

Bitcoin adoption has been increasing at an annual rate of 113%, according to data from the digital asset management firm CoinShares. (Meanwhile, people adopted the internet at a slower rate of 63%.) If people warm up to Bitcoin at a comparable rate to that of the internet’s early days (or faster), the report makes the case that there will be 1 billion users by 2024 and 4 billion users by 2030.

CoinDesk reported last month the number of new wallets worldwide increased 45% from January 2020 to January 2021, to an estimated 66 million. Popular crypto exchange Coinbase says it has now over 73 million worldwide users, while fellow exchange Gemini recently released its “State of U.S. Crypto Report,” which found 21.2 million Americans own cryptocurrency of some kind.

Regulation

Federal officials have made it clear in recent months they are paying attention to crypto. Industry professionals have recently alluded to what crypto insiders perceive as “hawkish” federal regulation being one key driver for Bitcoin’s lagging price. In a recent CoinDesk First Mover interview, Seth Ginns, a CoinFund managing partner, said “the Fed moved to a hawkish position [on crypto regulation] just as Omicron started to tick up in the U.S.,” which could have increased doubt in crypto as a viable asset—resulting in January’s bearish sentiments.

Crypto regulation brings up a lot of unanswered questions. President Joe Biden recently signed an infrastructure bill requiring all crypto exchanges to notify the IRS of their transactions. Similarly, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently said stablecoins — a type of crypto linked to the value of the U.S. dollar — should be subject to federal oversight.

The conversation on regulatory policies is “patchy,” said an industry white paper published by Flourish, a fintech platform designed for investment advisors. With a relatively new asset class like cryptocurrency, any new regulation has potential to impact value.

When China banned crypto in September 2021, for instance, investors saw the price of Bitcoin drop, though it has since risen and resumed its usual volatility. Even though there’s now about a decade of precedent for Bitcoin, the Securities and Exchange Commission is taking all decisions on a case-by-base basis in what experts refer to as its “crawl, walk, run” strategy toward mainstream crypto adoption.

“[Regulation has] kind of evolved over the last five years,” says Ben Cruikshank, head of Flourish, “Regulators can always change their mind.”

Mining Cycles

Finally, another major influence on Bitcoin’s price is a cycle known as halving. It’s complicated and algorithmic in nature, but in essence halving is a step in the Bitcoin mining process that results in the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions getting cut in half.

Halving influences the rate at which new coins enter circulation, which can impact the value of existing Bitcoin holdings. Historically, halvings have correlated with boom and bust cycles. Some experts try to predict these cycles down to the day after a halving event concludes.

What Investors Need to Know About Bitcoin Price Projections

As with any investment, financial planners and other experts advise against letting Bitcoin’s price fluctuations lead you to emotional decision making. Studies have shown investors who contribute regularly to passive index funds and ETFs perform better over time, thanks to a strategy called dollar cost averaging.

That’s part of why experts recommend not investing more than 5% of your overall portfolio in cryptocurrency, and never to invest at the expense of saving for emergencies and paying down high-interest debt. The path to long-term wealth and saving for retirement is most often successful for people with diversified investments like low-cost index funds, with crypto making up a very small part.

And even with crypto, experts say a set-it-and-forget-it approach makes sense. “Passive investing is a very valid way to achieve financial goals,” says Arkansas-based certified financial planner Sarah Catherine Gutierrez.

Since crypto is still new to most people, it’s OK to wait and see how things unfold before putting your money on the line. We only have about 10 years of data to inform crypto price predictions, and the value of Bitcoin — while potentially climbing long-term — is highly volatile from day to day.

Volatility makes it hard to know the “what” and “why” behind your crypto strategy. Before investing in Bitcoin or any alternative assets, ask yourself what you want to achieve from your participation in this particularly volatile market, and why. That will help you stay focused.

“I don’t think people understand across the board how to value [Bitcoin],” says Gutierrez. “When you’re buying it, you need to know your expectation of what value you’re going to get from what you’re buying.”

Financial planners don’t have a bias against cryptocurrency, Gutierrez says, particularly if a client expresses an interest in learning about it. However, you should ask yourself whether you need crypto as part of your plan. In most cases, says Gutierrez, the answer is no.

“Our take is that we don’t think you need Bitcoin in order to reach financial goals,” she says, adding that the average person should favor simple ways of investing that are easy to understand. This will keep you on track for core financial goals and better position you long-term for a healthy retirement."

Here are 5 things that happened in the space this past week	['Taylor Locke']	"NFT.NYC signage outside the Nasdaq MarketSite during the Annual NonFungible Token (NFT) Event in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.

1. Over 5,000 people attend NFT.NYC conference

To celebrate their love for NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, over 5,000 people attended the NFT.NYC conference in Manhattan last week. The highly anticipated event, which left 3,000 people on a waitlist, began on November 1 and ended on Thursday. The week included 600 speakers on panels, as well as parties, dinners, raves, galleries and attractions. The people behind notable NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club threw an actual yacht party on the Hudson River, along with an owners-only concert by The Strokes at music venue Brooklyn Steel. NFT enthusiasts, top crypto influencers and mainstream celebrities all attended, including director Quentin Tarantino, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and comedian Chris Rock, to name a few. Throughout, attendees traded 700,000 event NFTs, according to CoinDesk.

2. 'Squid Game'-inspired cryptocurrency crashes

A cryptocurrency inspired by Netflix's hit TV series ""Squid Game"" crashed after its founders cashed out, CNBC reported on Tuesday. The token, called SQUID, hit a high of just over $2,861 on Nov. 1 before plummeting to near zero, according to price-tracking website CoinMarketCap.

CoinMarketCap issued a warning that it received ""multiple reports"" that users were unable able to sell the token on Pancakeswap, a popular decentralized exchange, and the token's white paper and website have since disappeared. It seems that the token's creators collected at least $3.4 million in investor funds. The incident appears to be a so-called ""rug pull,"" where project founders abandon a project and take investor funds with them.

3. Quentin Tarantino to offer seven uncut scenes from ‘Pulp Fiction’ as NFTs

On Tuesday, Quentin Tarantino announced plans to sell seven uncut scenes from ""Pulp Fiction"" as NFTs. Each will also include handwritten scripts from the film and audio commentary from Tarantino himself, which will only be able to be seen by owners of the NFT. The NFTs will be auctioned on marketplace OpenSea. A launch date has not yet been announced.

4. Incoming NY mayor Eric Adams vows to take first three paychecks in bitcoin

New York City mayor-elect Eric Adams plans to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin, he said in a tweet on Thursday. ""NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry,"" Adams wrote. On Wednesday, Adams also said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio that he wanted to wager a ""friendly competition"" with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who is a big bitcoin supporter. ""He has a MiamiCoin that is doing very well — we're going to look in the direction to carry that out,"" Adams told Bloomberg Radio, alluding that he's looking into creating a city coin for New York that is similar to Miami's.

Bitcoin Leads the Drop

Bitcoin is leading markets into the red during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. BTC has lost 7.3% over the past 24 hours in a fall to around $61K at the time of writing.

The king of crypto has retreated 11.6% from its Nov. 10 all-time high of a touch over $69K. Pricing models such as stock-to-flow are still predicting larger gains for Bitcoin before the end of this year with a target price of $135K painted.

Despite this latest loss, BTC has still more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year when it was trading at around $29K. According to Tradingview, there is support at the 50-day moving average which is around the $58,800 price zone.

Bitcoin’s fall comes just a day or so after its Taproot privacy upgrade went live with no issues.

Altcoins Bleeding in Crypto Plunge

As usual, the rest of the crypto market is being dragged down by big brother. Ethereum has retreated 8% on the day in a tumble to $4,329 at the time of writing. ETH has now lost 11.2% from its all-time high of $4,878 also on Nov. 10.

The altcoin market is a sea of red at the moment with no token in the top 50 making a gain today. Binance Coin, Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Polkadot have all lost between 6% and 11% over the past 24 hours.

Larger losses are being felt by other altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Crypto.com (CRO) which have all decreased more than 12% on the day."

""We remain optimistic that Bitcoin will keep testing its all-time highs and hit the $100,000 mark by the end of this year. We are witnessing the biggest financial revolution in modern history which will forever change the way monetary transactions are executed,"" he said in a statement.

According to Nigel Green, CEO and founder of deVere Group which has $12 billion under management, Bitcoin is undeniably a mainstream asset class and most investors should consider including crypto assets as part of a diversified portfolio.

""In July, we publicly predicted that Bitcoin would reach and most likely beat it's previous all-time highs. I am confident that while there might be some profit-taking in the near-term, so that investors can accumulate more later, the momentum is such that we can expect prices to continue on their upward trajectory,"" he said recently.

Building wealth is a long-term process and requires disciplined efforts. Investing a small amount at regular intervals is the prudent way forward, rather than investing in one go. It helps to ride out the wave of volatility. Attempting to time the market is a pretty flawed approach and does not work most of the time. Cryptocurrencies have steadily transitioned into an asset class that has the potential to deliver better returns than most other asset classes. However, it comes with a greater risk than many other asset classes. Investors should ideally not put more than 5-7% of their net worth into cryptocurrencies.

2021-11-11 08:41:00+00:00	Crypto markets shudder as Evergrande fears re-emerge	['Lachlan Keller', 'Author Profile', 'Lachlan Is A Journalist', 'Producer At Forkast Working Melbourne', 'Australia. His Work Can Be Found In Numerous Magazines In Australia On Topics Ranging Culture To Science. Lachlan Holds A Bachelor S Degree In Journalism Macleay College In Australia.']	"The crypto market was rocked this morning Asia time as news that indebted Chinese property giant Evergrande may default on a US$148 million bond payment sent prices dropping around 5% across the board. Prices stabilized throughout the day, however, after the firm was able to make the payment at the last moment as the grace period deadline expired yesterday. With the company around US$300 billion in debt, there are concerns over the effect the company defaulting would have on global markets, both crypto and otherwise.

The price drop-off comes after days of strong price action among many leading tokens. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, both reached new all-time highs within hours of each other overnight before each losing more than 5% coming into business hours this morning, according to data from CoinGecko. Both following very similar price movements, Bitcoin reached US$69,044 just after midnight with Ethereum reaching a new level of US$4,878 shortly after.

This is not the first time concerns over Evergrande’s future have caused global markets to falter. In September a similar scare saw crypto markets losing around 9% as the company debt woes made headlines around the world, with the threat of its collapse, eliciting comparisons to the Lehman Brothers downfall that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008. The fallout from the pending default was not as acute this time around, but one market analyst told Forkast.News the company’s troubles are far from over.

“Every time [Evergrande] makes a payment, the clock starts ticking down for the next one, and I think the market’s very much aware that it’s always going to try and use that grace period [on its loans],” said Andrew Sullivan, founder and writer for Asianmarketsense.com. “It doesn’t have enough money to pay for everything on time, so it’s having to play swings and roundabouts, taking money from the left pocket to the right pocket … in order to pay different suppliers, different bondholders.”

With the exception of stablecoins, no tokens in the top 10 by market cap were spared the downturn, though some were more affected than others. Binance Coin, in third position, which had been making a run up on its all-time high it set back in May, had been trading at its highest point since that time before dropping 10% this morning. It has since recovered and was trading at US$630 at press time, according to CoinGecko.

Fifth-place Solana set its own all-time high of US$259 over the weekend in the leadup to the network’s first major global conference, Breakpoint, which was held in Lisbon earlier this week. Among the major developments announced at the conference was a US$100 million partnership with the venture firm of Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social media site Reddit, to invest in decentralized social media platforms to be built on the network. Solana saw a 7% decline in the two hours before trading this morning, but has recovered swiftly and was trading back near its mid-week high at US$246 as of press time, according to CoinGecko.

After sitting in third position for much of the past few months in the leadup to its long-awaited Alonzo upgrade, which was to bring smart contract capabilities to the network, Cardano has been in slow decline since early September. An impressive price run earlier in the week seemed to suggest a change in fortunes for the network, gaining 20% in a matter of days to reach a one-month high of US$2.36. Its price retreated from this point quickly, however, and with the 9% drop off this morning, most of the gains of the past week were erased. It was trading at US$2.15 at press time, according to CoinGecko.

While the company — like the global economy — is not out of the woods yet, today’s payment has bought Evergrande some time, with the next major payment not being due until early 2022. Nonetheless, the company is still rife with liquidity issues and has had to resort to extreme measures to get money together. Company employees have been told they must give the firm short-term loans if they wish to receive their bonuses, and company founder and chairman Xu Jiayin put a luxury house in Hong Kong he owns as loan collateral at the request of company creditors.

Speculation abounds as to whether the Chinese government would allow Evergrande to fail, or would step in to save the company, though Sullivan does not believe that it would, instead that it may attempt to apply subtle pressure to other developers to help the flailing behemoth out. Evergrande’s competitors may be disinterested in stepping in as many of the company’s projects are already pre-sold, and so would yield little capital in return. While this has been done in the past, it was while the markets were much healthier, and Sullivan speculates some competitors may be holding off on buying any assets until the prices come down even further.

The real estate market has had enormous economic and cultural value to the world’s most populous nation, and if it were to collapse it would be disastrous for the country and its people. “People in China view property to a large extent as their bank, this is their pension,” Sullivan said, explaining as the housing market was slowing down, the Chinese government was trying to shift the economy towards the production of high-end technological goods, such as semiconductors.

China has taken a progressively hard-line approach to cryptocurrency this year starting with a crackdown on mining throughout the country before putting a blanket ban of all cryptocurrency-related transactions in September due to the government’s belief crypto is disrupting the economic and financial order.

Sullivan said the strong market action recently could have raised tensions with would-be investors within the country, but the government has taken advantage of the current moment to smooth over the cryptocurrency issue — among others.

“People are naturally going to be resentful of the fact that they’ve been banned from that market,” Sullivan said. “How much they can do about it, how much that’s going to sway the government [it’s] difficult to say. The thing about Covid is that it’s allowing [the government] to be very, very draconian, to close China down, to make sure people aren’t aware of what’s going on outside so much as they would have before. So that suits [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping].”"
