[]	"Popular YouTube crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, has been considering the logarithmic regression band for the total cryptocurrency market cap in his latest video, and based on his analysis, thinks that the total digital asset market cap could hit $10 trillion during the next bull run.

What’s A Logarithmic Regression Band?

While it may sound like AI-generated musicians for psychotherapists to relax to, the logarithmic regression band is actually the range of values to which the crypto market tends to fall back when it is not in a bubble. It is represented by the green band on the chart below.

The line forms a smooth curve overtime when plotted against a logarithmic value scale. At the peak of the 2017-2018 bubble/burst cycle, the total crypto market cap came very close to $1 trillion. However, it has since fallen back to the regression band and currently stands at around $290 billion.

Diminishing Returns Each Crypto Market Cycle

Plotting the difference between the total market cap and the lowest point of the regression band over time shows that the peak levels are becoming lower with each market cycle. This supports the theory of diminishing returns over time.

Assuming this behavior continues, we can project a potential peak level above the regression band for the next major bull run. As an example, Cowen projects this happening in 2022, but of course, it could be earlier or later than this, if it happens at all.

The potential outcome of this would be a total cryptocurrency market cap of around $10 trillion at the peak of the next bubble. In this scenario market cap is likely to oscillate within the regression band for a while before starting its climb.

But What About $100 Trillion Bitcoin?

Ah yes, according to PlanB’s stock to flow (S2F) model, the Bitcoin market cap alone is projected to go to $100 trillion. Cowen’s $10 Trillion market cap peak for the entire crypto market doesn’t sound so impressive against that prediction.

Of course, the $100 trillion Bitcoin is still some way off in the future. The projected price increases in the S2F model happen because of the artificial limiting of supply over time. The next halving will happen in May this year.

However, the $100 trillion projection isn’t due until another two halvings after that, or sometime in 2028. So, for now, a $10 trillion market cap by 2022 will have to do.

At current Bitcoin dominance levels, a $10 trillion total crypto market cap gives a BTC price of around $330,000, so that’s something to look forward to.

Do you think the total crypto market cap will hit a $10 trillion valuation in 2023? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

He Is Profoundly Active In The Bitcoin Space Since', 'Has Contributed To Several Cryptocurrency Media Outlets', 'Including Newsbtc', 'Fxdailyreport', 'Bitcoinist', 'Ccn. Academically', ""Yashu Holds A Bachelor'S In Information Technology"", 'With Majors In Data Structures', 'C', ""Programming Language. He Has Also Won The 'Atulya Award' For His Efforts Towards Raising""]"	"Jacob Canfield, a crypto market analyst known for accurately predicting bitcoin’s 2020 price rally, has alleged that there was market manipulation in the trading of altcoins this year.

In a video published last week, Mr. Canfield linked the resurgence of otherwise underperforming cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and EOS to PlusToken, a Ponzi scheme that, under the disguise of a high yield investment company, stole over $3 billion from its clients. The steal included 70,000 bitcoin, 790,000 ether, and 26 million EOS tokens.

Mr. Canfield noted that PlusToken scammers first artificially pumped bitcoin from $3,500 to circa $14,000 last year. They then sold about 70-90K BTC in the range of $9,000 and $13,000, which roughly equals about $600 million. The profitable move gave them enough capital to drive the altcoin market upward.

“If [Plustoken scammers] are using their capital to push the Ethereum market, then they can push its prices back to $300, $500, $600 and even $1,000,” said Mr. Canfield. “They can also set up traps for short-sellers and continue to push the short-seller cascade in thin-order markets.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpiUaytYuFo

The statements came at the time when altcoins are severely outperforming their top rival bitcoin. Ethereum and EOS, for instance, surged by up to 130 and 155 percent after bottoming out in December 2019. In the same timeframe, bitcoin surged by up to 63 percent only.

On the whole, the crypto market – excluding bitcoin – attracted up to circa $66 billion between December 2019 until February 2020 top.

Mr. Canfield theorized that PlusToken scammers are using cryptocurrency exchanges and OTC brokers with closed order-books to trade their steal for alternative crypto tokens. The analyst further admitted that he has stopped entering short leveraged positions over his fears of fat price dumps.

Crypto Trend Will Continue

Despite fears of a massive dump, Mr. Canfield believed the crypto market will keep rising. The analyst recommended traders to identify near-term dips to buy Ethereum, EOS or other altcoins but exit their positions on the first signs of deep pullbacks.

He further advised traders to watch the crypto wallets that belong to the scammers associated with PlusToken, noting that any kind of small or big withdrawal would alert them of a potential bearish correction."
2020-02-10 16:15:36+00:00	Bitcoin Whale Gives Warning About Inflated Market	[]	"One of the leading traders on Bitfinex and a notable Bitcoin whale has given a warning about the impact of ‘phantom money’ on the market.

How much of cryptocurrency trading is real? By some estimates, only a small fraction of the entire market. A bombshell report in March 2019 found that around 95% of the entire market is fake, as BeInCrypto has previously reported. Since then, exchanges and various exchange data sites have put in stricter reporting standards with metrics like ‘real liquidity.’

Despite these changes, however, one whale claims that the market is still incredibly ‘inflated.’ Joe007 (@J0E007) is a prominent Bitcoin whale in the cryptocurrency world. Often known for topping Bitfinex leaderboards, he’s also been outspoken on rumors in the industry—and often doesn’t hold back criticism.

As Bitcoin breaks the $10,000 price point and the entire market rallies, Joe007 criticized the amount of so-called “phantom money” in the market. He writes: “At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show.”

You can push the price only so long with fantom money. At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show. — Joe007 signals·alerts·funds are scams, all of them (@J0E007) February 9, 2020

However, recent metrics seem to contradict Joe007’s claim about this rally being based on the so-called ‘phantom money.’ On-chain investor activity has increased significantly parallel to this rally, as also reported by BeInCrypto. This didn’t happen when Bitcoin broke $10,000 in the summer of 2019, so there’s no reason to believe that this rally is less legitimate than others.

Joe007 is known for stirring the pot on Twitter and causing controversy. For example, last month Joe007 claimed that Binance was outright faking their numbers. He’s also taken issue with Huobi and OKEx faking their reported trading stats as well. A known critic of Bitcoin SV (BSV), Joe007 has also said that BSV delistings may have helped the coin ‘scam pump’ much easier due to low liquidity.

Whether or not Joe007 is correct about the cryptocurrency market’s current rally remains to be seen. As of now, Bitcoin has dropped down under the $10,000 price point and is currently trading at around $9,800."

Cryptocurrency markets have been climbing higher in value as coins like BTC have gained over 19% during the last 90 days. However, many other digital assets have seen much larger gains and BTC dominance has been sliding downwards consecutively for the last 14 days.

BTC’s Ratio of Market Dominance Sinks to 60%

During the last few weeks, BTC dominance has dropped from a high of 70% to a low of 60%. The term and metric BTC dominance is the ratio of BTC’s market capitalization versus all the other coin market caps. So the current market valuation of the entire cryptoconomy is around $305 billion and BTC captures 61% of that today with a market valuation of around $186 billion. BTC has always been the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and prior to February 2017, the asset captured more than 80% of the entire cryptoconomy for eight years straight. However, the video tweet below shared in 2018 shows how crypto dominance metrics can change drastically over time.

After February 26, 2017, BTC dominance slid from 85% to a low of 40% one month later. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) spiked to an all-time high of 31% of the cryptoconomy’s overall valuation and XRP was at 17%. A number of people believe that BTC’s rising network fees and clogged backlog (mempool) of transactions in 2017 and 2018 attributed to the decline. Alongside this, many crypto proponents and traders referred to the time as “alt season,” in which a variety of alternative digital assets reduce BTC’s share of the entire coin market cap.

After BTC dropped to a low of 40%, the dominance metric slid even lower in January 2018 as BTC dominance was around 33%. Since then, the digital currency has regained a lot of market cap dominance and BTC had risen to close to 70% on September 8, 2019. However, after the jump to 70%, BTC’s share of the cryptoconomy has been sliding once again. From September’s high of 70%, BTC dominance has dropped down to 60% on February 15, 2020, losing roughly 10%. The sliding metric has been due to other digital assets that have done far better percentage-wise as far as gains are concerned. For instance, during the last 90 days, BTC has gained 19%, but ETH jumped 52%, XRP 26%, BCH 82%, and BSV rose by 185% in that time period. BTC dominance has slid consecutively for the last 14 days straight to its current low and only today has it started to rise again slightly. It’s been one of the longest downward slides for BTC dominance since September 2018.

Are Market Valuations and Dominance Important Metrics?

Even though BTC dominance is a metric used by crypto market price aggregation websites, many proponents do not believe the data reflects any real value. Market caps only reflect the current worth of every coin circulating in real-time and some people think the data can be skewed. Despite the fact that a number of crypto proponents believe market caps and dominance are inadequate value metrics and do not necessarily reflect the project’s real worth, these metrics are used by the majority of crypto enthusiasts. In the early days, after assets like namecoin, ripple, litecoin, and mastercoin appeared, the website coinmarketcap.com was developed and the public were able to compare coins based on market valuations. There’s now a great variety of coin market cap aggregation websites that show similar data and provide other statistics too like trade volumes.

Despite some believing that market cap lists are not a good reflection of real value, individuals find the data very important. As mentioned above, investors believe there are significant reasons for BTC dominance declines, whether it was the network stress or alt season that prompted the decline from 85% to 33%. Market caps and dominance metrics show investors the level of risk involved as small-caps, mid-caps, and large-caps see different types of movements.

Traditionally, mid to small market caps are far more volatile than larger-cap cryptocurrencies and they can spike in price and drop in value very quickly. People view market valuation and dominance as a reliability metric because large caps usually present less risk to investors. Smaller crypto market caps provide investors with high-risk trading situations which can be good or bad depending on how the individual is trading.

The fact that BTC lost 61% of the dominance it commanded over the entire cryptoconomy between February 2017 and January 2018 is a metric of great importance to a lot of crypto enthusiasts. When BTC’s dominance climbed from 33% back to 70%, some maximalists and hardcore BTC supporters said that “altcoins were dying.” Although ever since this, altcoin values have been outperforming BTC by a long shot. Lesser known coins are also outpacing many coins in the top 20. BCH and ETH’s rise during the last 90 days did outperform BTC, but coins like presearch (PRE 2,641%), cryptaur (CPT 1,351%), htmlcoin (HTML 333%), vetri (VLD 322%), and Digixdao (DGD 308%) did even better.

Georgi'S Passion For Bitcoin"", 'Cryptocurrencies Bloomed In Late', ""He Hasn'T Looked Back Since. Crypto S Technological"", 'Economic Implications Are What Interest Him Most', 'He Has One Eye Turned To The Market Whenever He S Not Sleeping.']"	"The cryptocurrency market shows no signs of slowing down so far in 2020. After charting one of the most impressive performances in January, Bitcoin continues its rally in the first week of February as well. In the past seven days, the cryptocurrency increased by about 5.5%, claiming essential resistance levels on the way up. Currently trading at around $9,800, all eyes are on the critical psychological barrier of $10,000.

Bitcoin’s price was rangebound in the first few days of the week, and it dipped to as low as $9120 on Tuesday, February 4th. From there, however, it was all uphill. The cryptocurrency charted a high of around $9,900 and retraced a bit to $9,800. The market sentiment is particularly bullish as $10,000 seems in sight.

It’s not just Bitcoin, though. Altcoins are surging as well. Bitcoin’s dominance has decreased down to 63.9%, which means that other cryptocurrencies manage to claim serious grounds.

As seen in the above picture, not only are altcoins in the red, but almost all of them are marking double-digit increases in the past seven days. Ethereum has had an impressive performance, surging upwards of 23%, while XRP follows closely with 17%. An interesting survey revealed that 50% of cryptocurrency traders hold mainly altcoins over Bitcoin at this time.

In a broader view, the trend of government-backed cryptocurrencies continues. Federal Governor Lael Brainard recently said that the US is looking closely at launching its own. Japan is also reported to move forward with its plans to avoid falling behind China.

2020-02-20 09:00:31+00:00	This weird Bitcoin pattern suggests Wednesday’s 10% dump may precede a massive surge	['Nick Chong', 'News Desk', 'Chainwire', 'Samuel Wan', 'Andjela Radmilac', 'Cole Petersen', 'Jonnie Emsley']	"Over the past few days, all anyone could talk about on Crypto Twitter was the golden cross that had formed on Bitcoin’s one-day chart.

For those unaware, a traditional golden cross in technical analysis is when an asset’s 50-day simple moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average, suggesting that a decisive bull trend is forming. As Investopedia further explains on the subject matter:

“As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes. […] It is interpreted by analysts and traders as signaling a definitive upward turn in a market.”

So, unsurprisingly, when Bitcoin formed this auspicious sign at the start of the week, cryptocurrency investors across the board were over the moon, claiming that the next parabolic bull run that will take BTC to $100,000 and beyond was starting then and there.

Though this was quickly proven not to be the case. On Feb. 19, the cryptocurrency cratered from the $10,300 daily high to as low as $9,250 on some exchanges — a drop of just around 10 percent — in a matter of a few hours, liquidating hundreds of millions of dollars worth of leverage positions.

Despite this brutal crash that undoubtedly caught traders with their pants down, Bitcoin’s strong correction may actually be par for the course in a wider uptrend.

Bitcoin could be on verge of strong bull run, despite 10% crash

As aforementioned, Bitcoin, from its peak on Feb. 19, dropped just around 10 percent. This, of course, was shocking; the golden cross that formed just a day or two earlier was a sign to many investors that the days of BTC dropping hundreds of dollars in a day were long over.

The thing is, the leading cryptocurrency just this week exhibited almost the exact same trend the last time a golden cross was registered:

As this writer explained in the tweet below, in the 48 hours after Bitcoin’s golden cross in April 2019, the price of the asset plunged by $641, marking an 11.41 percent move lower, before starting to trend higher in the weeks after the post-cross correction. In fact, in the two months after the golden cross and the subsequent plunge formed, BTC surged 180 percent to a level just short of $14,000.

Fun fact: Bitcoin dumped 11% in the two days after the last golden cross in April 2019, then proceeded to rally ~170% to $14,000. pic.twitter.com/i3XYS5XNII — Nick Chong (@_Nick_Chong) February 20, 2020

This writer wasn’t the only one who noticed this peculiar trend of Bitcoin temporarily moving against its crosses prior to moving in the trajectory the cross suggests.

Alex Krüger, a macroeconomist and cryptocurrency market commentator, noted in his own tweet that Bitcoin’s printing of a death cross (the opposite of a bull cross) preceded the 42 percent “China pump” that took BTC across $10,000 for the first time after weeks of a bear trend. What followed this was a 50 percent retracement from prices above $9,000 to $6,400 in the months that followed.

These two cases suggest that Bitcoin, after finishing its correction over the next day or two, will form a new uptrend that will take it past the previous local top at $10,550, likely to start a longer-term bull market.

Golden cross sets a good tone for the market

Indeed, golden crosses have historically preceded the cryptocurrency’s biggest uptrends higher. More specifically, data this writer compiled shows that the golden cross in 2012 led to a 20,578 percent surge in the price of Bitcoin and that a golden cross in 2015 led to the 6,739 percent rally that took BTC to just shy of $20,000.

Yes, there were two cases where the golden cross actually preceded macro declines of 65 percent and -32 percent, though that was when the 200-day moving average was rolling over, not starting to trend higher as it has over the past few weeks."
2020-02-04 00:00:00+00:00	XRP Bucks Crypto Market, Strategist Says Bitcoin (BTC) Must Hold This Line to Avoid Major Breakdown	[]	"XRP is one of the few crypto assets seeing green as Bitcoin and the crypto markets shift into negative territory.

At time of publishing, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up 6.57% at $0.2659.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin is down 1.24% at $9,176, Ethereum is down 0.84% at $187.87 and Bitcoin Cash is down 0.87% at $379.11, according to the data tracker COIN360. Here’s a bird’s-eye view of the market.

Despite today’s rally, crypto strategist DonAlt tells his 127,000 followers on Twitter that XRP remains in a bear trend until it can break above $0.30.

“Going according to plan, I TPd early to avoid the $0.25-$0.30 resistance area which is where pretty much all of the risk is. As I stated early in the thread, $0.30 is the number to beat, until that happens all of this is a bear market retracement.”

As for BTC, it hit resistance at $9,551 on January 30th, leaving crypto traders wondering just how large the current correction will be.

A trader known in the industry as TraderXO tells 31,500 followers on Twitter that BTC will remain bullish if it can post a higher low in the coming days. The trader says BTC needs to stay above $7,600 to $8,200 to avoid a major breakdown.

“BTC – Higher Low and I’m Bullish.

If the local top is in and BTC prints a higher low between 7.6k – 8.2k – then my bias would be bullish.

Breaking below 7.6k’s more so the yearly open then quite likely BTC drops further lower, continuing its bearish market structure towards 5.8 – 6k.”

2020-02-21 00:00:00+00:00	7 Explosive Cryptocurrencies to Buy for the Bitcoin Halvening	['Luke Lango']	"The third big ""bitcoin halvening"" is coming in May, and according to our very own Matt McCall — whose Ultimate Crypto portfolio has averaged a jaw-dropping 40% gain in 2020, against a market that’s flat year-to-date — that’s a huge reason to be bullish on cryptocurrencies in 2020.

But, before we jump into understanding what that halvening is (also referred to as a ""halving"") and which cryptocurrencies to buy for 2020, let's first understand why cryptocurrencies as a broad asset class have a bright future.

The core purpose of cryptocurrencies is relatively simple: leverage technology to eliminate the middle-man in financial transactions and make buying and selling things less costly and more efficient. Through the blockchain - a decentralized public ledger of transactions that anyone can view consistent across the whole network, unable to be edited and/or updated unless the whole network agrees with the update - cryptocurrencies are able to conduct and verify financial transactions without needing any central oversight.

That may sound like a mouthful. It's not. Traditional currencies need big banks to oversee and verify all transactions. Cryptocurrencies do not. This means they're less costly and more efficient than traditional currencies, because there's no middle-man to pay and no paperwork to fill out.

Sure, there are risks to cryptocurrencies achieving mainstream adoption and overtaking government-backed currencies. But, lower transaction costs and quicker transactions are large enough value props to warrant there being a bright future for cryptocurrencies (even if they don't take over the world).

Why the Halvening Is Bullish

Now, let's take a deeper look at why cryptocurrencies will rise in 2020.

Two key characteristics of bitcoin are limited supply and constrained supply growth. That is, there are a fixed number of bitcoins in the world (21 million).

The bitcoin world started with most of those bitcoins being locked in the system. Each time an individual updated bitcoin's ledger (also called ""mining""), the individual would unlock new bitcoins. But to constrain supply growth and retain incentives for mining, the bitcoin system is set up so that every so often, the amount of new bitcoins unlocked for mining a block is halved.

So far, bitcoin has undergone two halvings. After the first halvening in 2012, bitcoin prices rose about 8,000% over the following 12 months. After the second halvening in 2016, bitcoin prices rose about 2,000% over the following 18 months. In both instances, many .

In other words, bitcoin halvings have traditionally been exceptionally bullish catalysts for cryptocurrencies. And that makes complete sense. According to Will Cong, Associate Professor of Finance at Cornell University, - money supply and velocity would be important determinants - to the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the end of the day, prices are determined by supply and demand. If supply growth slows, and demand growth doesn't, then prices should go up.

The third bitcoin halvening is coming in May 2020. The number of bitcoins unlocked for mining one block will fall from 12.5 bitcoins, to 6.25 bitcoins. Because of this halving, bitcoin’s supply is expected to rise by just 2.5% in 2020 — an all-time low for the cryptocurrency. It’s expected to rise by less than 2% in 2021.

Concurrently, demand growth should accelerate in 2020, driven by the introduction of more financial derivative products, broader support from central banks and increasing recognition of bitcoin as a digital store of value.

Bigger demand growth plus lower supply growth equals higher cryptocurrency prices. That’s largely why Matt McCall, who has already picked two 70%-plus altcoin winners this year, thinks that the best of the big 2020 cryptocurrency rally is still ahead of us.

With all that in mind, I suggest readers keep a close eye on these seven explosive cryptocurrencies in the coming year:

Cryptocurrencies to Buy for 2020: Bitcoin (BTC)

Of course, the most obvious cryptocurrency to buy for 2020 is bitcoin. Over the next few months, bitcoin will be a direct beneficiary of slowing supply growth and accelerating demand growth across the cryptocurrency world.

On the supply side, the third halving in May will directly impact the amount of new bitcoins coming into market, and will lead to relatively slow supply growth.

Meanwhile, on the demand side, bitcoin demand will move higher in 2020 simply because this is the ""gateway"" into cryptocurrencies for new investors. That is, as new investors enter the cryptocurrency market over the next few quarters, most of them will likely start by getting their feet wet with bitcoin, implying that cryptocurrency demand growth in 2020 should run largely parallel to bitcoin demand growth.

Accelerating demand growth plus constrained supply growth will lead to higher prices for bitcoin in 2020.

Zcash (ZEC)

Privacy is a top priority in the cryptocurrency community, and privacy-focused coins will likely win big in 2020. That's why McCall has picked top privacy coin Zcash as one of his top altcoin investments for 2020.

Zcash is a pure play on the growing importance of privacy in cryptocurrency.

That is, the first wave of cryptocurrencies was all about decentralization:

“Existing currency valuation models do not quite take into consideration decentralization — a potentially distinguishing feature of cryptocurrencies,” says Professor William Cong of Cornell University.

Now that cryptocurrencies have gained more mainstream traction and are starting to exhibit staying power, it’s time for another distinguishing feature to emerge — privacy. Privacy is one of the more important and discussed characteristics in both the crypto world and the financial transaction world at large.

As the importance of privacy grows in the crypto world, privacy coins will outperform, and Zcash looks particularly primed to outperform given the company’s recent pivot into private mobile transactions.

Ripple (XRP)

A leading altcoin positioned for potentially big gains in 2020 is Ripple.

Ripple is a company which leverages blockchain technology to enable banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporations to send money globally, usually using the company’s cryptocurrency, XRP.

In many ways, then, Ripple is the infrastructure behind cross-border cryptocurrency payments.

As cryptos gain more mainstream traction, Ripple is adding more and more banks and various other customers to its network. Most recently, the National Bank of Egypt just partnered with Ripple.

More and more banks will partner with Ripple in 2020 as cryptocurrency awareness and demand rises. As it does, the price of XRP will rise, too.

Basic Attention Token (BAT)

One of the more interesting cryptocurrencies to watch in 2020 — and which could explode higher — is Basic Attention Token.

The core idea behind BAT is pretty simple. The digital advertising model is broken, in that user and advertiser incentives are not aligned. Instead, they run opposite one another. That is, advertisers want users to watch their ads, while consumers want to skip the ads.

The idea of BAT is to realign the incentive structure in the digital ad network so that user and advertiser incentives match one another.

To do this, users get paid Basic Attention Tokens to watch ads in the Brave browser, so that they are now financially incentivized to watch the ad. The end goal, of course, is that more consumers watch ads, and advertisers sell more product/generate more brand awareness.

It’s a pretty smart business model.

And, as cryptocurrencies gain more mainstream consumer traction in 2020, this smart model for compensating users to watch ads should similarly gain traction. As it does, the price of BAT should rise.

Chainlink (LINK)

One of the hottest cryptocurrencies, and one which Matt McCall thinks will remain red hot for the foreseeable future, is Chainlink.

In his Ultimate Crypto portfolio, Matt first recommended Chainlink in early January at a price of $2.09. Today, Chainlink trades hands at $3.87, up a whopping 85% in just five months. What’s more, that 85% return over the past five months, follows a 450% return in 2019.

In other words, Chainlink has been scorching hot. Strengthening fundamentals imply that it will remain hot for the foreseeable future.

Specifically, Chainlink leverages blockchain technology to create smart contracts, which are essentially self-executing contracts that can be executed without central oversight.

But businesses have been slow to adopt smart contracts because data is integral to executing these smart contracts, and there hasn’t yet been a reliable way to connect external data with the smart contract.

That’s exactly what Chainlink does. So, they provide a very necessary gateway to usher in broader adoption of smart contracts. This adoption uptake in 2020 will provide a natural tailwind for LINK, and the coin’s red-hot rally will likely persist.

Synthetix Network Token (SNX)

The Synthetix Network Token is a cool platform in the ethereum ecosystem which leverages blockchain technology to help bridge the gap between the often very obscure cryptocurrency world, and the far more tangible traditional asset world.

That is, in the Synthetix Network, there are Synths, which are synthetic assets that provide exposure to assets such as gold, bitcoin, U.S. Dollars and various equities like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The whole idea of these synthetic assets is to create shared assets wherein users benefit from asset exposure, without actually owning the asset.

It’s a very unique idea, and a promising project in the ethereum landscape. Because it helps bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets, it creates a level of familiarity and value that are often missing in other cryptocurrency assets. This familiarity and value ultimately position SNX price to rise in 2020.

DxChain Token (DX)

On the smaller side, a cryptocurrency which look like an interesting speculative buy in 2020 is DxChain Token.

DxChain is a very ambitious project which aims to use blockchain technology to solve the world’s data computation, storage and privacy issues. It’s a tall order. But, if it works, it could yield huge results in terms of DXC usage and value growth.

In 2020, data privacy concerns are front and center. As such, privacy-focused coins should rise. DXC is one of the more interesting privacy-focused coins with potentially huge long term upside.

While it’s still all very speculative, those attributes may make this altcoin worth the risk over the next few quarters.

In the bigger picture, it’s not an understatement to say that the opportunity in cryptocurrency in 2020 is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

New technologies are often undergirded by periods of rapid, exponential growth … before either dying out in supernova fashion or normalizing to meet realistic expectations. So when cryptos had their first “once-in-a-lifetime” event in 2013 — which turned every $1,000 into $93,000 — the spectating world thought they had missed out.

Then came the next life-changing event in 2017, turning every $5,000 into $123,000 … that was assuredly the big boom that you either rode to 25x gains or, well, you didn’t, right? Wrong.

Cryptocurrencies are unlike any trend we’ve ever seen before, and there will be another opportunity for investors to turn a fistful of dollars into millions of dollars.

The key to this explosion is the Halvening. Don’t miss out this time!

His Main Focus Is On Cryptocurrency Price Analysis', 'Industry News Coverage. Lets Follow Him On Twitter At']	"Bitcoin price bearish leg extends below $9,100 after support at $9,500 was shattered.

A possible double-bottom pattern could soon relaunch BTC/USD towards $10,000.

Bitcoin price is still exploring how deep the rabbit hole goes. Following the shattering of the key support at $9,500, sellers’ confidence shot up incredibly. Last week’s support at $9,300 did very little to stop the energized selling lot. BTC/USD extended the lower leg to $9,090 (intraday low). The price is down 1.84% towards the end of the Asian session, besides an attempt to pull the price upwards has hit a critical snag at $9,200. Instead, BTC/USD is exchanging hands at $9,142 while the trend remains inclined to the south and volatility levels are high.

Bitcoin Price Technical Picture

According to the indicators applied, BTC/USD is still under great duress and could dive farther towards the critical $9,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) downward slope within the oversold region doubles down on the heightened selling pressure. Similarly, the price is trading under the moving averages where the 50 SMA is exerting pressure at $9,563.70 on the hourly chart and the 100 SMA at $9,668. The visible and increasing gap between the two moving averages signals that sellers would stay longer in the driver seat.

BTC/USD hourly chart

Possible Double-Bottom Pattern

It is said that it gets darker before dawn. I believe Bitcoin’s ongoing declines would soon lead to a rally likely to blast past $10,000. However, the rally would depend on the ability of the double bottom pattern’s impact described in classical technical analysis. A double-bottom pattern is a reversal pattern that mostly breaks an extended downtrend allowing the bulls to take control as the sellers lose traction. Some of the regions likely to pose as selling zones during recovery include $9,200, $9,400, $9,600 and $9,800.

""Cryptocurrencies basically have no value,"" he said. ""You can't do anything with it except sell it to somebody else.""

The Berkshire Hathaway CEO remained a crypto critic despite dining with Tron CEO Justin Sun and other crypto bosses in January.

""The logical move from the introduction of bitcoin is to go short suitcases,"" Buffett joked, as criminals are laundering money online instead of stuffing cash into duffel bags.

Warren Buffett dismissed bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as worthless in a CNBC interview on Monday.

""Cryptocurrencies basically have no value,"" Buffett said. ""They don't produce anything.""

""You can't do anything with it except sell it to somebody else,"" he added. ""But then that person's got the problem.""

The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO trashed cryptocurrencies despite hosting a belated charity dinner with Tron CEO Justin Sun and four other crypto bosses last month.

Sun said he gave Buffett a pair of Samsung Galaxy Fold smartphones loaded with a bitcoin and nearly $2 million worth of Tron's cryptocurrency. However, Buffett denied holding any cryptocurrencies in the CNBC interview.

""I don't own any cryptocurrency,"" he said. ""I never will.""

Shorting suitcases

Buffett told CNBC that none of Berkshire's businesses uses bitcoin, and highlighted its frequent usage for illicit purposes.

""Bitcoin has been used to move around a fair amount of money illegally,"" Buffett said. He joked that bitcoin's ""economic contribution"" to society might be reducing demand for suitcases.

""The logical move from the introduction of bitcoin is to go short suitcases,"" he quipped, as criminals increasingly move money online instead of stuffing cash into duffel bags.

Buffett may be a vocal critic of crypto, but he gave kudos to Sun for paying a record amount for their charity meal. The investor auctions off the chance to eat with him each year to raise money for Glide, a homeless charity in San Francisco.

""Justin gave $4.6 million to Glide and that will buy a lot of meals and provide a lot of beds for people in San Francisco,"" Buffett said. ""I thank him."""
2020-02-06 12:06:53+00:00	Bitcoin SV jumps back over $300 amidst global market rally	['Decrypt', 'Daniel Phillips']	"In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has gained more than 7% to reach over $300 for the first time since late January. At time of writing, BSV sits at just over $304, after adding almost half a billion dollars to its market cap since yesterday.

Following this most recent price action, Bitcoin SV is now the second-best performing large market capitalization cryptocurrency—narrowly edged out by Ethereum (ETH).

Despite its recent growth, Bitcoin SV has had an extremely volatile last month. Following earlier developments in the Craig Wright vs Kleimann court case, investors were initially led to believe that Wright would produce indisputable evidence of his ability to access $8 billion in Bitcoin, which would verify his claim to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. This news caused BSV to pump to more than $400 last month. However, a later turn of events found Wright unable to prove that he could access the funds, leading Bitcoin SV to lose some of its recent gains.

After briefly flipping Bitcoin Cash (BCH) out of the position of fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin SV has once again regressed to fifth-place after losing more than a third of its value in the space of three days in mid-January. Bitcoin SV currently retains the position of fifth largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap in excess of $5.5 billion.

With that said, Bitcoin SV isn't the only cryptocurrency experiencing strong growth today. Practically every major asset is performing well, with the global cryptocurrency market now up just over 3%."

2020 promises to be a good year for the cryptocurrency market. With many high anticipated developments planned to take place, investors and experts are expecting nothing but all ‘greens’ this year. Of course, the crypto market will again see the influx of new digital coins all with the aim of making it to the top. Many cryptocurrencies have been projected to excel this year and this piece sheds light on a few of them.

1. Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum has been bitcoin’s biggest challenger for the most part of its crypto journey. The digital coin, however, has failed to impress over the past few months, but many experts believe this is about to change.

Its dApp processing platform raked in over 1.4 million users last year, of which 1.28 million were new users with the remaining number, returning users. Ethereum’s network use has evolved over the past years and its adoption rate is also on the high. Many experts are predicting a big year for the digital coin.

2. Tezos (XTZ)

Tezos’s underlying technology which is supported by an on-chain governance system takes its proof of stake technology to the next level. Its ecosystem, according to experts is on course to become a major public infrastructure, after major bodies expressed interest in it. The digital coin is currently ranked 11th and is trading at $1.98 but expected to climb up to $12 by the end of the year.

3. Litecoin (LTC)

Litecoin was one of the best-performing coins last year and is expected to carry on with that superb form this year. With its Lightning network already up and running, LTC will be interchangeable with Bitcoin. Litecoin has always been seen as the superior coin over Bitcoin in terms of Technology, as its platform is ready to serve as a global payment network, something that Bitcoin cannot offer.

Its price is expected to double this year, with other experts believing that, the digital coin will achieve a whopping 440% rise before the end of the year. Currently trading at $69.70, the coin is amongst the top options for investment this year.

4. Stellar Lumens (XLM)

Stellar Lumens is projected to conquer the market in 2020 with regards to remittance payments, ICO’s on its network, cross-border payments in small banks and other financial institutions, decentralized exchanges such as SDEX and the implementation of the lightning network.

Although Ripple’s XRP will dominate in the big bank circle, as well as Solaris, powering past Stellar (now 5 times larger than Stellar in terms of market share), Stellar Lumens is projected to run the other aspects which put them in the same league as the aforementioned digital coins.

5. XRP

Undoubtedly the leading coin in terms of banking infrastructure, Ripple looks set to achieve more this year. With a partnership with Worldwide financial services powerhouse, Western Union and projected deals lined up from Moneygram, the digital coin is going to maintain its spot as the go-to coin in terms of banking. The digital coin is reportedly going to achieve over 380% this year and with its price currently at $0.25, it is one of the coins to keep tabs on.

6. ICON (ICX)

ICON seeks to connect crypto to the real world by building the largest decentralized network that will enable users to communicate between diverse blockchains and is going to be a convenient platform that will serve institutional and retail investors. ICX token is currently trading at $0.52 and this price is expected to hit the $5 mark this year, thus according to predictions.

7. Cardano (ADA)

Cardano started the year on a strong note, moving from $0.033 at the start of the month to currently trading at $0.056. Even though its adoption rate is still lacking behind, the coin is expected to change around this year. The launching of the Goguen Project and the KEVM testnet is expected to give the coin a push. Cardano’s 47% rise in the opening stage of the year makes a strong case for a bullish run this year."
2020-02-06 00:00:00+00:00	Running on Empty: A Proposal to Fill the Gap Between Regulation and Decentralization	[]	"Chicago, IL

Thank you George [Chikovani] for that kind introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to be with all of you today. Before beginning, I have to remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Securities and Exchange Commission or my fellow Commissioners.[1] Indeed, the views I will express today are not fully formed in my own mind and may not reflect my own opinions in the months to come. To that end, I welcome the feedback of all of you and anyone else with an interest in the regulation of digital assets. These issues are difficult, and many bright minds on the Commission’s staff and outside are trying hard to develop a reasonable framework. As I thought about talking with you today, a story—one that predates my career as a regulator, but nevertheless informs it—bubbled out of my memory.

More than two decades ago, I was on a road trip. I was lost. I did not have a cell phone. It was very late at night. It was pouring. The gas gauge was on empty. There was no gas station in sight. I was distraught until two things happened. First, I saw the lights of a lone gas station blinking in the not-too-far distance. Second, I realized that I was in New Jersey! Recalling something a college friend had told me, I would not have wanted to be anywhere else on a stormy night with an empty gas tank. This friend, who had grown up in New Jersey, had never pumped gas in her life—a deficiency she attributed to a New Jersey law that allowed only gas station employees to pump gas. Everybody else was prohibited from pumping gas. That law sounded a little silly at the time, but now that I was in New Jersey about to enjoy this mandated luxury on a rain-drenched night, it sounded just wonderful. Relieved that the fumes in my tank got me to the station, I pulled up to the pump, which, incidentally, was not under a roof substantial enough for even a rain shower, let alone this downpour. There it was—the unequivocal sign saying that it was illegal for anyone other than a gas station attendant to pump gas. I waited expectantly for the station attendant, roused from a comfortable slumber by my arrival, to emerge from his booth and start the pump. He looked at me. I looked at him. He pointed at me. He pointed at the pump. His message was clear—forget the law, there would be no full service on that dark and stormy night. I will not tell you what choice I made, but let’s just say that the soundtrack for that drive was Bruce Springsteen’s State Trooper: “New Jersey Turnpike ridin’ on a wet night ‘neath the refinery’s glow . . . I got a clear conscience ‘bout things I done. Mister state trooper, please don’t stop me.”[2] A sensible regulatory framework would have not prevented my pumping the gas rather than being stranded in the rainy dark of night. Perhaps the New Jersey law had a hardship exemption to cover just such situations, but the empty gas tank and sign prohibiting me from filling it seemed irreconcilable at the time.

In any case, the memory of that incident brought with it a basic lesson as I think about regulation of digital assets. It is important to write rules that well-intentioned people can follow. When we see people struggling to find a way both to comply with the law and accomplish their laudable objectives, we need to ask ourselves whether the law should change to enable them to pursue their efforts in confidence that they are doing so legally.

Entrepreneurs across the crypto landscape are facing just such a scenario in their attempts to develop worthwhile and beneficial products. Whether it is issuing tokens to be used in a network, launching an exchange-traded product based on bitcoin, providing custody for crypto assets, operating a broker-dealer that handles crypto transactions, or setting up an alternative trading system where people can trade crypto assets, our securities laws stand in the way of innovation. While I look forward to working with people in the community to develop solutions to each of these problems, today, I am going to focus on how to address the regulatory difficulties faced by people who want to build functioning token networks.

Before detailing my proposal for a safe harbor, I will first outline the problem. Many crypto entrepreneurs are seeking to build decentralized networks in which a token serves as a means of exchange on, or provides access to a function of the network. In the course of building out the network, they need to get the tokens into the hands of other people. But these efforts can be stymied by concerns that such efforts may fall within the ambit of federal securities laws. The fear of running afoul of the securities laws is real. Given the SEC’s enforcement activity in this area, these fears are not unfounded.

The SEC has scrutinized token sales through the lens of SEC v. Howey,[3] a now infamous case describing what an investment contract is. An investment contract is one type of security under our federal securities laws. The Howey case dealt with the sale of orange groves, and subsequent cases have involved the sale of a host of other esoteric assets.[4] In the Howey case, purchasers of units in the orange grove were deemed to be purchasing securities because they were buying the managerial efforts of others along with their piece of the orange grove.

The SEC has tried to apply the Howey analysis to crypto, but doing so is not particularly easy. For example, some commentators have pointed out that we have elided the distinction between the token and the investment contract.[5] The “contract, transaction or scheme” by which the token is sold may constitute an investment contract; but, the object of the investment contract—the token—may not bear the hallmarks of a security. Conflating the two concepts has limited secondary trading and has had disastrous consequences for the ability of token networks to become functional. Also of concern, suggesting that tokens will increase in value, combined with securing secondary market trading, can trigger a conclusion that those tokens are being sold pursuant to an investment contract. There are circumstances in which the security label fits, but, in other cases, promises made about tokens increasing in value are nothing more than expressions of the hope that a network will succeed and be used by lots of people. I would argue that the analysis should focus on the objective nature of the thing offered to the purchasers. If the token seller is simply discussing the potential for an increase in the value of a token in the same manner that a seller of any number of other consumer products might appeal to purchasers’ desire to buy a product of lasting or even increasing value, it there an investment contract? The subjective intent of any particular purchaser should not be controlling. If it were, then is there any end to the Commission’s authority? How would that logic apply to a shoe company, which, as it sells you a pair of sneakers, promises to hire some prominent athletes to promote the brand, thus focusing your mind on how sky high the price will go on StockX[6] rather than on how high your new kicks will enable you to jump on the basketball court?

The SEC’s approach in these cases has made it extremely difficult for a company to distribute a token—a process that typically includes planning for a future in which people use the network and talking positively about its prospects for success—without running into a charge that the company is engaged in a securities offering. We have even hinted that a token airdrop in which tokens are given out freely might constitute an offering of securities. How is a person supposed to get a network up and running when she cannot even give away the tokens necessary to use the network?

One option is to stay far away from the securities laws by simply releasing a white paper, publishing the open source code, mining the genesis block, and then stepping back to allow a network of users blossom organically. Other entrepreneurs, however, might choose to remain actively and publicly involved in building a network for some time. Some of these people have chosen to proceed with their token offerings as planned in the hopes that they can avoid scrutiny under the securities laws and perhaps convince the SEC that their networks are sufficiently functional to avoid the securities label. This approach is risky because proving that tokens have utility prior to being distributed to a widespread user base is difficult.

Another option is for the developers to sell the tokens in a registered offering or pursuant to an exemption from registration. To date, no registered offering of tokens has been conducted in the United States. Many token offerings have proceeded under exemptions from registration, typically Regulation D exemptions that require tokens be sold exclusively to accredited investors with transfer restrictions. Given the limited pool of persons qualifying as accredited investors based on the current wealth and income tests, it can be difficult for these projects’ networks to take off.

Several issuers of tokens have opted for conducting exempt offerings pursuant to Regulation A.[7] However, the costs of conducting one of these so-called “mini-IPOs” can be prohibitive. Even if a team has the financial resources to take this route, once the token is a security, it must trade as a security. A core benefit of a token network is its non-reliance on intermediaries; people transact directly with one another. Having to buy or sell tokens through a registered broker-dealer or on a registered exchange certainly puts a damper on the development of a thriving, decentralized crypto network. Particular problems arise because there are unique challenges related to broker-dealers and exchanges handling digital assets.

Other projects have sought to sever any ties with the United States to avoid the reach of our securities laws. This approach is risky because invariably some activity occurs in the United States. Moreover, this approach is detrimental to the US economy because it prevents American citizens from participating in budding token networks. It is evident that any route chosen by a team to distribute tokens into the hands of potential users is fraught with uncertainty under the securities laws.

We have created a regulatory Catch 22. Would-be networks cannot get their tokens out into people’s hands because their tokens are potentially subject to the securities laws. However, would-be networks cannot mature into a functional or decentralized network that is not dependent upon a single person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts unless the tokens are distributed to and freely transferable among potential users, developers, and participants of the network. The securities laws cannot be ignored, but neither can we as securities regulators ignore the conundrum our laws create.

There is, I think, a way to address the uncertainty of the application of the securities laws to tokens. The safe harbor I am laying out this morning recognizes the need to achieve the investor protection objectives of the securities laws, as well as the need to provide the regulatory flexibility that allows innovation to flourish. Accordingly, the safe harbor protects token purchasers by requiring disclosures tailored to their needs, preserving the application of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, and giving them an ability to participate in networks of interest to them. The safe harbor also provides network entrepreneurs sufficient time to build their networks before having to measure themselves against a decentralization or functionality yardstick.

I have spoken openly about my intention to sketch out a safe harbor, and in response, I have gotten some very helpful feedback. But before detailing the specifics of my proposal, I want to emphasize that this remains a work in progress. I look forward to additional input, and, if I am able eventually to convince my colleagues to add consideration of such an approach to the SEC rulemaking agenda, many other voices, I hope, will weigh in. For now, the text of the proposed safe harbor is available for viewing as an appendix to this speech at sec.gov and will be posted on social media so that unfiltered critics can apply their editorial hacksaws to it. You also can give me a call, send me an email, stop by my office, or provide feedback at FinHub. After all, I am very much a believer in the value of drawing on the creativity and ingenuity of as many people as possible. That is why I find decentralized networks such a powerful phenomenon, and one that will allow society to benefit from the talents of people who—because of societal or geographic barriers—have heretofore been excluded.

I call particular attention to the definitions section of the safe harbor. I am a securities regulator, not a technologist, and am eager to learn how the definitions can be improved. The challenge is accurately capturing the technology without baking-in terminology that will become outdated in a short period of time.

One struggle I have had in constructing this safe harbor is the appropriate scope. My core concern is for projects that are looking to build a decentralized network, but have difficulty bridging the legal gap. Additionally, our staff has issued no-action letters to centralized networks.[8] While sales of tokens intended for these networks seem much less likely to implicate the securities laws, the existence of the no-action letters could be interpreted to suggest otherwise. Hence, I am suggesting that the safe harbor be available for these types of projects also.

Another unsettled matter is that the safe harbor could take the form of a rule or a Commission-level no-action position. In taking a no-action position, the Commission would pledge not to bring enforcement actions against project developers that fall within the parameters laid out in the position. A no-action position may be preferable to a rule because it would not concede that the token sales it covers fall within or outside of our securities laws. Such grey areas are an appropriate place for no-action relief. On the other hand, a rule-based approach would be more durable and would make clear that state laws do not apply. For purposes of this discussion, I will lay out the safe harbor as a rule.

Getting into the specifics of the proposal, the safe harbor would provide network developers with a three-year grace period within which they could facilitate participation in and the development of a functional or decentralized network, exempted from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws, so long as the conditions are met. This objective is accomplished by exempting (1) the offer and sale of tokens from the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, other than the antifraud provisions, (2) the tokens from registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (3) persons engaged in certain token transactions from the definitions of “exchange,” “broker,” and “dealer” under the 1934 Act.

The initial development team would have to meet certain conditions, which I will lay out briefly before addressing several in more depth. First, the team must intend for the network on which the token functions to reach network maturity—defined as either decentralization or token functionality—within three years of the date of the first token sale and undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to achieve that goal. Second, the team would have to disclose key information on a freely accessible public website. Third, the token must be offered and sold for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network. Fourth, the team would have to undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to create liquidity for users. Finally, the team would have to file a notice of reliance.

The first requirement—that the initial development team must intend for the network to reach network maturity within three years—is intended to focus project teams’ minds. At the end of three years, token transactions would not be securities transactions if the network has matured into a decentralized or functioning network on which the token is in active use for the exchange of goods or services. To assess decentralization, the team must consider whether the network is not controlled and is not reasonably likely to be controlled, or unilaterally changed, by any single person, group of persons, or entities under common control. The mere theoretical possibility of a 51% attack, for example, would not prevent a team from determining that the network is decentralized under this definition. Nor would the participation of the team in a network alteration achieved through a predetermined procedure in the source code that involves other network participants prevent a team from determining that the network is decentralized. To assess functionality at the end of three years, the team must consider whether holders can use the tokens in a manner consistent with the utility of the network. For example, can holders use the tokens for the transmission and storage of value, to prove control over the tokens, or to participate in an application running on the network?

The tests laid out in the safe harbor are meant as proxies for the considerations raised in the SEC’s Howey analysis and attempt to bring clarity on when a token transaction should not be considered a securities transaction. These tests should be easier to pass at the end of three years than when the network is first launched. Once the network cannot be controlled or unilaterally changed by any single person, entity, or group of persons or entities under common control, the token that operates on that network will not look like a security. Even for a network that remains centralized—think of the networks outlined in the TurnKey Jet and Pocketful of Quarters no-action letters—once the tokens are actually in use to buy and sell the services for which they were intended, the securities laws will be clearly inapplicable.

Three years is a long time and token purchasers need certain protections during this grace period, which brings me to the second requirement detailing the disclosure that must be provided. The disclosure requirement of the safe harbor addresses information asymmetry concerns and mandates that certain information be provided on a freely accessible public website. The team launching a token project knows details about the project that would be useful for potential token buyers to know. Of primary importance is the source code and transaction history. The safe harbor requires this information to be publicly available and encourages the development of a block explorer, or similar tool, for verifying the transaction history. Token purchasers also need to understand the purpose and mechanics of the network. For example, the team would have to explain the launch and supply process, including the number of tokens to be issued in the initial allocation, the total number of tokens to be created, the release schedule for the tokens, and the total number of tokens outstanding. Public disclosure also would include information about how tokens are generated or mined, the process for burning tokens, the process for validating transactions, and the consensus mechanism. The team also would have to explain the governance mechanisms for implementing changes to the protocol.

Another key disclosure would be the plan of development, including the current state and timeline for the development of the network that provides a roadmap to how and when the initial development team plans to achieve network maturity. To demonstrate how realistic these plans are, a team could explain, for example, how the network development will be financed and who is on the development team. To provide insight on the initial development team, the names and relevant experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills of each person that is a member of the team must be disclosed. Required disclosure also includes the number of tokens owned by each member of the team, a description of any limitations or restrictions on the transferability of tokens held by such persons, and a description of the team members’ rights to receive tokens in the future. In addition, teams would need to disclose any time that a member sells five percent or more of her originally held tokens over any period of time, which would help to guard against fraud. Additionally, team token sales could be an indication of flagging commitment to the project.

To further demonstrate their commitment to building a functioning network, teams will be required to update the posted disclosures to reflect any material changes. Changes affecting the token economics, the network’s functionality, or the team developing the network will be of great interest to potential users of the network. A team committed to building a widely used network likely would provide these updates regardless of whether we mandated it.

The third condition is that the token must be offered and sold for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network. This condition, along with the definition of token, is meant to clarify that the safe harbor is not appropriate for debt or equity securities masquerading as tokens.

The safe harbor’s fourth condition requires the team to attest that it intends to, and will undertake, good faith and reasonable efforts to create liquidity for users. To the extent the team attempts to secure secondary trading of the token on a trading platform, the safe harbor requires the team to seek a trading platform that can demonstrate compliance with all applicable federal and state law, as well as regulations relating to money transmission, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection. Moreover, to alleviate existing regulatory uncertainty on the applicability of securities laws to the secondary trading of tokens, the safe harbor would exempt persons engaged in certain token transactions from the definitions of “exchange,” “broker,” and “dealer” under the 1934 Act.

Admittedly, the liquidity condition may surprise observers of SEC staff positions in which attempts to facilitate secondary trading have been viewed as indicia of a securities offering. In the context of the safe harbor, by contrast, secondary trading is recognized as necessary both to get tokens into the hands of people that will use them and offer developers and people who provide services on the network a way to exchange their tokens for fiat or crypto currency. To the extent it is aware, the team would disclose any secondary trading platforms on which the token trades.

The final condition is the need for the team to file a notice of reliance on EDGAR within fifteen days of the date of the first token sale in reliance on the safe harbor. As part of the filing, a member of the team would have to attest that all the conditions of the safe harbor are satisfied. The notice filing would also include the website where the required disclosure may be accessed. None of the disclosures required by the safe harbor would be provided in the notice filing on EDGAR.

Having outlined the conditions of the safe harbor, I would like to emphasize a few points concerning its scope. SEC enforcement has played an important role in combatting fraud in connection with token sales.[9] The safe harbor would not provide immunity from such actions. First, the safe harbor would not be available to a team if one or more members of the team is subject to disqualification as a bad actor under the securities laws. Second, the safe harbor would reserve the SEC’s antifraud authority with respect to token sales under the safe harbor. Although the safe harbor would preempt state securities laws, it would not stand in the way of state antifraud actions. If anyone lied in connection with selling tokens pursuant to the safe harbor, the SEC or a state could bring an enforcement action. This provision is not directed at teams that set forth a plan for a network and work earnestly toward building it, but fail to bring it to fruition. Rather, it is designed to ensure that the SEC can bring suit against a team that sets out to defraud token purchasers by materially misrepresenting or omitting key information. We all know that there are plenty of those kinds of “projects” polluting the crypto space.

It is also important to note that the safe harbor would be available for tokens that were previously sold in a registered offering or pursuant to a valid exemption under the Securities Act. These teams may need the safe harbor in order to permit secondary trading to occur and to distribute their tokens more widely into the hands of potential users. Tokens that already are in widespread use on a decentralized network presumably are not securities and, therefore, would not need to take advantage of the safe harbor. It is during the development phase that questions about the securities/non-securities line seem to be most difficult to resolve. Once a token network is up and running, few people would advocate application of the securities laws.[10] By essentially buying time for this question to be answered, the safe harbor makes it much more likely that the question as to whether something is a security can be answered in the negative.

Now that I have outlined the safe harbor, I suspect some of you are asking, “Who cares?” I get the point. I am one of five Commissioners. I cannot write rules unilaterally. However, to quote another of the Boss’s songs: “you can’t start a fire without a spark.”[11] It does not hurt to get the ball rolling. People change their minds. Moreover, if we are going to do something like what I suggest today, I want to get it right. Getting it right means that I need people like those of you in the audience or reading this speech to weigh in and tell me what I have gotten right and what I have gotten wrong.[12] Don’t be that guy in New Jersey telling me I have to do this all by myself.

Appendix

Token Safe Harbor Proposal

Office of Commissioner Hester M. Peirce

February 6, 2020

Proposed Securities Act Rule 195 – Time-limited Exemption for tokens.

Preliminary Notes:

1. Distributed ledger technology may be used to offer and sell digital assets, such as tokens, to raise capital and for other purposes. The U.S. federal securities laws may apply to such transactions, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.

The analysis of whether a token is offered or sold as a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the digital asset. A token may be offered and sold initially as a security because it is wrapped in a transaction involving an investment contract, but that designation may change over time if the token is later offered and sold outside of an investment contract. For example, a token sale may no longer be the sale of an investment contract if purchasers could no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts.

However, in order for a network to mature into a functional or decentralized network that is not dependent upon a single person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts, the tokens must be distributed to and freely tradeable by potential users, programmers, and participants in the network. Additionally, secondary trading of the tokens typically provides essential liquidity for the users of the network and aids in the development of the network. The application of the federal securities laws to these transactions frustrates the network’s ability to achieve maturity and prevents the transformation of the token sold as a security to a non-security token functioning on the network.

Accordingly, this safe harbor is intended to provide Initial Development Teams with a three-year time period within which they can facilitate participation in, and the development of, a functional or decentralized network, exempt from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws so long as the conditions are met. The safe harbor is also designed to protect token purchasers by requiring disclosures tailored to the needs of the purchasers and preserving the application of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

Upon the conclusion of the three-year period, the Initial Development Team must determine whether token transactions involve the offer or sale of a security. Token transactions may not constitute securities transactions if the network has matured to a functioning or decentralized network. The definition of Network Maturity is intended to provide clarity as to when a token transaction should no longer be considered a security transaction but, as always, the analysis will require an evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances.

2. Rule 195 is not an exclusive safe harbor. A person who does not meet all of the applicable conditions of Rule 195 still may claim any other available exemption under the Securities Act of 1933 for the offer and sale of the securities.

(a) Exemption. Except as expressly provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Securities Act of 1933 does not apply to any offer, sale, or transaction involving a token, as defined herein, if the following conditions are satisfied by the Initial Development Team, as defined herein.

(2) Disclosures required under paragraph (b) of this section must be made available on a freely accessible public website.

(3) The token must be offered and sold for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network.

(4) The Initial Development Team intends to and will undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to create liquidity for users. If the Initial Development Team attempts to secure secondary trading of the token on a trading platform, it will seek secondary trading platforms that can demonstrate compliance with all applicable federal and state law and regulations relating to money transmission, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection.

(5) The Initial Development Team files a notice of reliance in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) Disclosure. The Initial Development Team must provide the information described below on a freely accessible public website.

(iii) An explanation of governance mechanisms for implementing changes to the protocol; and

(iv) Sufficient information for a third party to create a tool for verifying the transaction history of the token (e.g., the blockchain or distributed ledger).

(4) Plan of Development. The current state and timeline for the development of the network to show how and when the Initial Development Team intends to achieve Network Maturity.

(5) Prior Token Sales. The date of sale, number of tokens sold, any limitations or restrictions on the transferability of tokens sold, the amount raised, and the type of consideration received.

(6) Initial Development Team and Certain Token Holders. Furnish the following information.

(i) The names and relevant experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills of each person who is a member of the Initial Development Team;

(ii) The number of tokens or rights to tokens owned by each member of the Initial Development Team and a description of any limitations or restrictions on the transferability of tokens held by such persons; and

(iii) To the extent members of the Initial Development Team have a right to be rewarded tokens in the future in a manner that is distinct from how any third party could obtain tokens, describe how such tokens may be rewarded.

(7) Trading Platforms. Identify secondary trading platforms on which the token trades, to the extent known.

(8) Sales of Tokens by Initial Development Team. Each time a member of the Initial Development Team sells five percent of his or her tokens as disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section over any period of time, state the date(s) of the sale, the number of tokens sold, and the identity of the seller.

(c) Filing of Notice of Reliance. The Initial Development Team offering or selling tokens in reliance on Rule 195 must file a notice of reliance on the safe harbor no later than 15 calendar days after the date of the first token sold in reliance upon the safe harbor, unless the end of that period falls on a Saturday, Sunday or U.S. federal holiday, in which case the due date would be the first business day following.

(1) The notice must contain the following information:

(i) Names of the Initial Development Team, including each individual member;

(ii) Date of the first token sold in reliance upon the safe harbor;

(iii) Attestation by a person duly authorized by the Initial Development Team that the conditions of this section are satisfied; and

(ii) Functional, as demonstrated by the ability of holders to use tokens for the transmission and storage of value, to prove control over the tokens, to participate in an application running on the network, or in a manner consistent with the utility of the network.

The definition is not meant to preclude network alterations achieved through a predetermined procedure in the source code that uses a consensus mechanism and approval of network participants.

Proposed Exchange Act Rule 3a1-2. Exemption from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) of the Act.

An organization, association, or group of persons shall be exempt from the definition of the term “exchange” to the extent such organization, association, or group of persons constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilitates bringing together purchasers and sellers of tokens satisfying the conditions of Rule 195 of the Securities Act, or otherwise performs with respect to such tokens the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood.

Proposed Exchange Act Rule 3a4-2. Exemption from the definition of “broker” for a person engaged in a token transaction.

A person is exempt from the definition of the term “broker” to the extent it engages in the business of effecting transactions in tokens satisfying the conditions of Rule 195 of the Securities Act of 1933 for the account of others.

2020-02-08 18:54:59+00:00	After Four Years, Is Decred Better than Bitcoin Yet?	['Liam Kelly']	"Share this article URL Copied

Decred, a hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (Pos) crypto network, turns four today. And unlike the average, fickle altcoin project, Decred’s message has been clear since 2016: Be a better Bitcoin.

But how close has it come to achieving this objective? Crypto Briefing asked two of the protocol’s most active researchers to find out.

A 10,000 Foot Perspective

The hybrid consensus mechanism used to mine each and every Decred (DCR) token is one of the protocol’s strongest selling points.

Enthusiasts have indicated time and again that this mechanism is more secure than networks using exclusively one or the other. Understanding how it operates is relatively straightforward.

Like Bitcoin, miners in the Decred network work to produce blocks. Unlike Bitcoin, Decred’s blocks must be again verified by stakeholders, or in Decred parlance, PoS ticket holders. These tickets can be purchased with DCR tokens in an open auction. Every Decred block announces 20 tickets for sale.

At the time of press, one ticket currently costs an estimated 135.11 DCR, or ~$2,868. Token holders are allowed to bid on as many tickets as they can afford.

To participate, DCR holders must first wait for the Decred network to announce an open bid on a ticket via users’ wallet software. Interested parties then place their bid and wait for the miners to include it in an upcoming block. The bid joins a pool of bids for the same 20 tickets.

Ticket holders still need to wait 24 hours before using their ticket to vote on an incoming block, however.

Five PoS tickets in the network are pseudo-randomly selected to validate a mined block. Three of them must validate the block mined for the block to be attached to the blockchain. If this validation fails for whatever reason, the blocks must be mined again.

If successful, then the block reward is split three ways: 60% to miners, 30% to winning ticket votes, and 10% to the Decred treasury.

One can think of Decred as having added a functional social layer on top of the mining protocol. Token holders, or those most incentivized to benefit from a healthy network, can actively participate in the project’s security. It is in their best interests to behave honestly because it is also the most economically sound choice in this network.

Thus, attacking the Decred network is slightly more complicated than a brute force 51% mining attack. Malicious agents would need both a majority of the hashing power and the majority of the tickets in the network.

Assuming the cost of mining equipment, market cap, and hashpower is the same as pure-play PoW networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, one analyst, Zubair Zia, concluded in 2018 that “Decred would be ~22 times costlier to attack than Bitcoin and ~9 times more expensive to attack than Etheruem.”

The above outline is only the foundation. Since launching this hybrid consensus mechanism, a lot has been added to Decred in the past four years.

Decred’s Governance Experiments

“I only found Decred in early 2018, so I can only really speak to the past two years,” said Permabull Niño in a Twitter conversation with Crypto Briefing. “The biggest thing for me is how much has been built in that time, which was an extended bear market.”

My crypto investment philosophy summarized in a graphic, and why I'm only willing to hold BTC and DCR. Dominant coins within a certain ledger assurance model will be the big winners is my bet pic.twitter.com/JKgMAqtklw — Permabull Niño (@PermabullNino) December 21, 2018

More than armchair crypto analysts, both Permabull and Checkmate have been hard at work researching, documenting, and getting the word out about all of the developments happening in Decred. The two have been so prolific, the Decred community has practically employed the duo to be its spokespeople.

In the same year that Permabull began digging into the nuances of the cryptocurrency, Decred launched Politeia. The initiative offers additional powers to ticket-voting stakeholders beyond helping with block confirmation. Indeed, the entire vision of the project, not just its security, has been handed over to the community.

Stakeholders can lance proposals for 0.1 DCR, and the rest of the community can vote and discuss the proposal through the Politeia portal. Like proposals, it costs 0.1 DCR to create a Politeia account. This cost is in place to prevent the rise of sock puppets and other forms of spam.

Proposals fall into two broad categories — those that looking for voter support to make a change to the protocol, or those that hope to draw funding from the Decred Treasury.

The latest proposal, for instance, is for a research grant to fund the work of Checkmate and Permabull.

“The goal is to build more charts on metrics that are specific to Decred,” Checkmate said in an interview with Crypto Briefing. This data would then be used to better understand Decred’s behavior as well as offer investors a more comprehensive understanding of the project.

Checkmate added:

“I believe [Decred is] the most important coin next to Bitcoin and want to explore what the data indicates and what the fundamental potential of the project is.”

To complete the task, Checkmate, along with Permabull, has asked the community for $17,500 for roughly eight months of work. Critically, this is the second proposal of the same nature; Checkmate asked for $12,000 in July 2019 for similar work. The community voted 92.3% in favor to pursue the research at that time.

The first proposal was also an opportunity to corral some of the more active members of the Decred community. This includes Richard Red, Murad Mahmadov, Zubair Zia, and others.

Once a proposal is approved by the community, the requisite funds are drawn from the treasury. If one remembers earlier, the treasury is replenished with 10% of the block reward each time a block is mined and validated by voters. At the time of press, the treasury holds 643,405.27025766 DCR, or $13.7 million.

Successful proposals have been wide-ranging, too. The community voted on whether to hire Wachsman, a blockchain-focused marketing agency, for instance. Other proposals have included creating video content, developing Decred-integrated ATMs, performing a bug bounty, and setting up a Decred-native decentralized exchange (DEX).

As for 2020, Permabull said that he is most excited about the upcoming DEX. “I think a lot of people are sleeping on its potential and over time it will become a key piece of crypto infrastructure,” they said.

For Checkmate, Decred is ahead of most other projects entering the decade. “As for fundamental potential of the project, the biggest narratives coming up are privacy, Chainalysis, KYC, security in the face of expanding derivatives (ability to short and 51% attack), funding, and governance,” they said. Concluding:

“Decred has solved these issues long before they showed up elsewhere. So far, betting against convention has paid off.”

But is it better than Bitcoin yet? The question isn’t yet relevant, according to Permabull.

“When Decred is larger in scale, the comparison between it and Bitcoin will be more appropriate.” Instead, Permabull takes solace in another thought. They said:

“Bitcoin changed the way I look at money, and Decred changed the way I look at cryptocurrencies.”

Whether it will eventually outpace the premier cryptocurrency is pure speculation. But as many throughout the crypto space experiment with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and the challenges of governance, one may not need to look much further than Decred."
2020-02-11 15:07:24+00:00	Cryptocurrency crime losses more than double to $4.5 billion in 2019, report finds	['Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss']	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Losses from cryptocurrency crime surged to $4.52 billion last year, as insider theft soared even as hacking losses declined, according to a report from blockchain forensics company CipherTrace seen by Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: A delegate talks on his phone at the Delta Summit, Malta's official Blockchain and Digital Innovation event promoting cryptocurrency, in Ta' Qali, Malta October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi

Last year’s losses were up nearly 160% from 2018’s total of $1.74 billion.

Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering bitcoin, is a shared database maintained by a network of computers.

Cryptocurrency user and investor losses due to fraud and misappropriation in 2019 increased by more than five times, while hacks and thefts fell by 66%, the report showed.

“We noticed a significant uptick in malicious insiders scamming unsuspecting victims or leaching on their users through Ponzi schemes,” Dave Jevans, CipherTrace chief executive officer, told Reuters. “Attacks from the inside of organizations lead to significant exits with major consequence to the crypto-ecosystem.”

Since bitcoin’s launch more than 10 years ago, governments and regulators around the world have grappled with the opaqueness and lack of transparency in the cryptocurrency market that has led to massive losses for investors.

Two large losses early last year were the main drivers for the surge, CipherTrace said.

Users and customers lost roughly $3 billion from an alleged Ponzi scheme involving crypto wallet and exchange PlusToken.

The other significant loss was the almost $135 million that customers lost from Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX following the unexpected death of its co-founder, according to CipherTrace.

The CipherTrace report also found illicit cryptocurrency money service businesses - including crypto exchanges - have transmitted funds on the payment networks of almost all the top 10 U.S. retail banks.

Analysis further revealed that a typical large U.S. bank processes billions of dollars annually in undetected cryptocurrency-related transfers.

“These clandestine operations create AML (anti-money laundering) compliance risks because criminals must find ways to launder ill-gotten crypto profits,” CipherTrace said in the report.

CipherTrace research found that banks globally paid more than $6.2 billion in AML fines in 2019."
2020-02-20 10:43:44.672000+00:00	Using Python to Get Crypto Market Data	['Yura Zatsepin']	"Using Python to Get Crypto Market Data

Let’s take a look at just how easy it is to download historical prices and alternative data in Python for the crypto market.

When referring to historical price data, this is about the Open, Close, High, Low price of any asset. You can create a trading bot or alert bot based on this data. Just create a scheduled script for this condition:

If Close > desired X: send_me_message(“Look at this!”)

The problem is here, let’s start to resolve it.

Alternative data is easy to skip over, but it’s important to really take a look at it. For oil stock, it’s financial data about the pricing of pipes, steel or data from logistic companies or any related data which can affect oil stock. Also, it can be a feed of news, government reports.

In the crypto world, it’s on-chain data, social data, news, etc, etc.

And this is super good news for you, as you can see each transaction from a historical perspective and in real-time on Blockchain. But how easy to get this data?

I will use Santiment API, It gives two approaches. Simply using Python library and one is based on using GraphQL. There are some alternatives out there (Coimarketcap, Coingecko, etc.), but Santiment API has more than just financial data.

The first approach uses a library called sanpy. Let’s install the sanpy library.

pip install sanpy

Then, here is the basic code you need to collect historical pricing data for Ethereum:

import san ohlc_df = san.get( “ohlc/ethereum”, from_date=”2015–01–01"", to_date=”2020–02–10"", interval=”1w” ) print(ohlc_df.tail())

You can see, that your result should be a Pandas dataframe containing weekly historical OHLC data for Ethereum.

Look at the first argument of san.get() function. (“ohlc/ethereum”) OHLC is a name of metric and “ethereum” is a slug. A Slug is a unique identifier for an asset. The best way to locate the slug for your asset is to open https://app.santiment.net and use the search.

If you have any questions just check this site.

Ok. Now try to fetch alternative on-chain data for Ethereum. For our first example, we can use Network Growth metric. Network Growth shows the number of new addresses being created on the project network each day.

net_growth_df = san.get( “network_growth/ethereum”, from_date=”2019–02–05"", to_date=”2020–02–05"", interval=”1d” ) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt net_growth_df.plot() plt.show()

If you want to understand what type of alternative data and metrics you can get with this library. You can read more https://github.com/santiment/sanpy or https://academy.santiment.net/for-developers/

Many crypto companies are using open source as a driver for their business. What can we say about projects based on their open source development activity? LTC is a good example. They just occasionally merge some new staff from BTC and don’t do anything new themselves.

Let’s prove it:

dev_df = san.get( “dev_activity/litecoin”, from_date=”2018–02–05"", to_date=”2020–02–05"", interval=”1d” ) dev_btc_df = san.get( “dev_activity/bitcoin”, from_date=”2018–02–05"", to_date=”2020–02–05"", interval=”1d” ) dev_df.plot() dev_btc_df.plot() plt.show()

Ok. Sure, you can scrape all this data from on-chain or GitHub, but it’s a complex engineering task if you want to make a simple alert bot.

And the final example. Let’s try to get social volume about Bitcoin"

It is a research-oriented club which is gently in the process of compiling reviews on MLM companies.

Although you sit in front of your computer or hold your cell phones for hours opening 10 to 15 tabs for the latest news and updates in the Crypto industry, but you still feel like you haven’t covered it all.

I am sure you have experienced it!!

Every day, there are so many updates going on in the Crypto world that it has become very hard to cover them all.

There are plenty of Crypto news sources available in the market and there are multiple apps that aggregate Cryptocurrency news from the market.

on the other hand, It is obvious that several queries might strike your mind, like :

Are they providing valid news?

Is there any option to filter out fake news that misdirects investors?

Do they provide insightful news to make informed buy/sell Crypto decisions?

Personally, I browse multiple websites for different information. I have started building my own list of favorites with maximum time spent reading news and analyzing different coins.

One such platform in my favorite list is CryptoPanic

What is CryptoPanic?

CryptoPanic is a News aggregator platform that helps users and traders understand price movements for the cryptocurrencies they hold or are trading. It is common knowledge that prices change every day for cryptocurrencies and it could take time to understand why they are falling or rising. Indeed, it would take you to for instance carry out research by scrolling through many crypto news sites and/or social media.

CyptoPanic crawls through reliable news websites and other sources like social media (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube etc.)

Their tagline is “If You’re Going To Panic, Panic Early.”

Besides news, you also receive an update on prices for major cryptocurrencies. This shows on the right border of the page. This feature allows you to track news for each of the cryptocurrencies. Thus you can use CryptoPanic to avoid the panic in the general crypto market but also in individual crypto markets and community.

It comes in hardy because news affects cryptocurrency markets as a whole or as individual cryptocurrencies.

“I Got Tired Of Running Around Cryptocurrency News And Subreddits To Understand Why Prices Are Suddenly Skyrocketing Or Falling”,

says the developer of this website.

Their website interface divides the screen into two parts. A feed of news from different sources appears on the left side. On the right side, there are details about the news that a user clicks on from the left.

News

The first section on the website is the news section. Similar to every Aggregator, CryptoPanic crawls through crypto news portals and lists the recently updated news under one section. You can find popular news portals like Cointelegraph, dailyhodl, newsbtc listed here. The News section also allows categorizing news based on recent updated or top news amongst updated ones. I feel this feature to be useful as one can easily search for intended news. It is also possible to sort news items as “All News,” “Trending,” or Positive and Negative. A user can also cycle through the news items by pressing on the J or K keys. A basic write-up about the topic accompanies each of the news items and there is a link to the original source of the news.

Media

With the advent of time, audio and video news have gained popularity. CryptoPanic takes a note of this and the media section lists all the audio/video news for the crypto users. Even podcasts are listed here. The same bifurcation News section follows can be found here.

Polls

Then comes the Polls section. All the recent polls can be found here. It is very useful as we understand the crypto sentiment of traders as well as end-users.

Resources

CryptoPanic Resources is a catalog of cryptocurrency resources. Users can submit their company resources, discuss crypto projects, etc.



Portfolio

CryptoPanic Portfolio is a crypto performance tracker. One can integrate API of the exchanges to their profile and track each crypto performance.



Develop and Region

The develop section lists resources to develop API, bots or widgets and keep the crypto news at your fingertips.



More about the right section

It also allows a user to log in and vote if the information in any news feed is positive, negative or important to the markets. This means that its users give feedback about the impact of the news feed on the website. Those feeds that score positive votes from most users show as green while those that users deem to have a negative impact will show as red. White is for neutral-impact news.

The right section of the website shows price of top cryptos like BTC, ETH, BCH, etc. It is a useful tool as we get to know the prices of all these cryptos for 1hr, 24 hr and 7 days all in one tab. you can click on each of them to reveal the news relating to that specific crypto chosen.

since there are all relevant news, many news are double posted by many news sites

Verdict – CryptoPanic Review

CryptoPanic includes a bunch of unique features that make a good option for many serious crypto traders. Although it’s one of the oldest crypto news aggregators in the industry, it has never stopped updating. What’s most attractive is the platform doesn’t limit any basic features. Thus, it doesn’t force users to get the PRO version."

2020-02-24 00:00:00+00:00	France: Regulation of Crypto-assets, Intermediaries and Initial Coin Offerings s in France	['Iris Barsan', 'Iris Barsan Joined Baker Mckenzie In October After Practicing As A Lawyer In A Franco-German Law Firm. Prior To That', 'Iris Worked For Several Years In The Legal Department Of The Prudential Control', 'Resolution Authority', 'As A Financial Lawyer In A French Banking Group', 'Insurance', 'Investment Banking .', 'Iris Holds A Doctorate In French', 'German Law', 'An Ll.M. The University Of Cologne']	"An optional “visa” for ICOs

ICO issuers have the ability, but not the obligation to apply for a “visa” from the French Financial Markets Regulator (AMF) in return for filing an information document, providing clear, transparent and not misleading communications to the public, and by complying with anti-money laundering (AML) duties. Such a visa gives an issuer access to a bank account and allows them to solicit investment. This is important in practice as many banks refuse to open bank accounts for actors in the crypto environment or actually close existing accounts. Potential investors are protected because without a visa, an ICO cannot target or solicit investments in any way.

Two-legged regulation of intermediaries

Intermediaries of the crypto ecosystem have also been regulated in this novel way. Intermediaries such as custodian wallet providers and crypto/fiat exchange service providers are subject to a mandatory AML registration, while all intermediaries including platforms and investment advisers may apply for an optional license. In other words, registration is mandatory but licensing is voluntary. The advantage of applying for a license is gaining access to a bank account and the ability to solicit investments.

Mandatory registration

As referred to already, custodian wallet providers and crypto-fiat exchange service providers must register with the AMF. France has simply transposed the AML-Directive, and as a result, they obtain a “monopoly” of the market that is protected from non-registered businesses by criminal sanctions. They also need to comply with a set of rules, which among others, include provisions in respect of anti-money laundering.

Voluntary registration

All intermediaries (custodian wallet providers, crypto-fiat exchange service providers, crypto-crypto exchange service providers, trading platform operators, service providers engaging in the reception and transmission of orders, investment advice, underwriting and guaranteed or unsecured investment) can voluntarily apply for a licence to the AMF. As result, they will need to comply with AML duties and other regulatory requirements, depending on the activity carried on. It should not be forgotten that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) revised its guidelines in October 2018 to recommend the registration and licensing of all intermediaries in the crypto ecosystem in order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

While the French regulatory framework has potential, its success depends on a cost-benefit analysis. Given that the blockchain ecosystem is mainly composed of start-up businesses, it is not certain that the benefits outweigh the regulatory costs. As these market participants are very mobile, and laws have a territorial scope, enforcement may become an issue. For more details, please consult this extended article by the author."

2020-02-08 17:26:59+00:00	SC On Cryptocurrency Case, Here's How Warren Buffett Owns A Bitcoin	['Suprita Anupam', 'Gargi S.', 'Chetan T.', 'Tapanjana R.', 'Jaspreet K.']	"On Feb 18, US authority to auction off 4,041 Bitcoin worth $37 Mn Tron founder Justin Sun meets Warren Buffett over dinner, gifts him a Bitcoin SC to hear Dalmia case after pronouncing judgement over IAMAI case

In spite of Elon Musk’s controversial tweets every now and then, automaker Tesla has been through an amazing journey. Be it the market cap from $33.68 Bn on May 20, 2018 to hitting $175 Bn for a brief period on February 6, or the share price, which registered 395% growth from June 6, 2019 to $868 on Feb 6, it’s been a dream run for the company, and so has been for Bitcoin, feels investment banker Michael Novogratz.

While both appear to have registered a parabolic growth, in the given time period, Bitcoin, in fact, has performed better than Tesla. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $10K.

In a tweet, Novogratz shared comparative growth curves of Bitcoin and Tesla. On Ripple, he said, “ Ripple will have another lackluster year in 2020.”

This soon sparked another debate on Twitter. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse responded, “XRP has outperformed BTC and the broader crypto market in 2020. XRP is up 44% (19.1 to 27.5) vs BTC’s 33% (7,100 to 9,500) so far this year.”

It is worth noting that Novogratz is the CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners which is a major investor in Ripple. In a series of Tweets, Novogratz, however, defended his statement. He said, “I commented the Ripple tokens underperformed BTC last year because Ripple owns a lot of them….Ripple and many other cryptos, like Ethereum are still in the ‘proving’ phase. They aren’t going to succeed as solely a store of value as BTC has taken that lane. Ripple does have its own fervent community (largely in Asia) but has a large supply to absorb (some 57% or so).”

Crypto Case: Dalmia Petition To Be Heard After IAMAI Case Judgement

Another crypto case, other than the clubbed cases pertaining to RBI’s 2018 circular on cryptocurrency, which was supposed to be heard on January 27, will now be listed after the IAMAI case judgement, said the Court.

Speaking to Inc42, petitioner and advocate in the case, Vijay Pal Dalmia said, that the Court has observed the direct correlation between the two cases. After pronouncing a judgement over IAMAI case where it is looking into the constitutional validity of RBI circular, it will have more clarity pertaining to our cases.

Dalmia said that the Court, having already heard the main arguments from the ends in IAMAI case, might pronounce the judgement within a month.

Long before Kali Digital, IAMAI and others filed numerous petitions in various courts, Siddarth Dalmia and Supreme Court advocate Vijay Pal Dalmia had filed a writ petition in 2017 in Supreme Court questioning the legality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A similar case was filed by Dwaipayan Bhowmick, later in 2017, seeking a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.

The crypto case of Siddharth Dalmia and Vijay Pal Dalmia actually talks about banning cryptocurrencies in India amid rising funding of terrorism and insurgency, illicit trade of arms and drugs, illicit investments, avoidance of banking channels etc.

While notices were issued to the respondents including the Union of India earlier in the case, on May 1, 2018, the Supreme Court had tagged these cases along with the fresh petitions filed by IAMAI and others.

On August 8, 2019 hearing, the Court further detagged the cases. It stated, “We have been informed by the learned Solicitor General that the Report of the Committee which proposes specific action be taken in relation to Virtual Currencies has since given on February 28, 2019. We have also been shown the Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019, which, according to the learned Solicitor General, may be introduced when Parliament is reconvened. Having regard to these facts, list the petitions in the last week of January 2020.”

Warren Buffett Finally Owns Bitcoin, Here’s How

Having purchased his lunch with legendary investor Warren Buffett at $4.57 Mn in June, last year, Tron Foundation founder and CEO Justin Sun finally had the dinner on January 23.

In a series of tweets, Sun shared his experience and also informed that he has presented a Bitcoin as well as 1,930,830 TRONs to Buffett. Both, the Bitcoin and TRON were stored in a Samsung Galaxy Fold which Sun presented to the investor.

“@WarrenBuffett received his first Bitcoin. This lucky Bitcoin is safely stored in his #Samsung Galaxy Fold. Since I gifted him this Bitcoin, Bitcoin has increased by 16%! Hope it continues to moon! Brought Mr. Buffett 2 Galaxy Fold w/ #TRON built in. @WarrenBuffett is officially a $TRX owner! I gifted him 1,930,830 $TRX equivalent to his bday! Mr. Buffett joked he wished he was born later so that he could have more! ”

Buffett is also known for his anti-Bitcoin stance. At a master-class and Q&A session in Omaha, Buffett once said, “You can’t value Bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset.”

Adding that Bitcoin has emerged as “real bubble”, he was not very enthusiastic about ICOs too, “People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates,” opined Buffett.

US Authority To Auction Bitcoins Worth $37 Mn

The US Marshals Services (USMS) has yet again announced the auction of 4,040 Bitcoins worth $37 Mn. While the bidders are required to register latest by February 12, the online auction will take place on February 18.

This sealed bid auction for 4,041.58 Bitcoin has been separated into four series: Series A (5 blocks of 500 Bitcoins) and Series B (10 blocks of 100 Bitcoins) and Series C (10 blocks of 50 Bitcoins) and Series D (1 block of 41.58424932 Bitcoins).

In a similar auction in January 2018, USMS had sold around 3,800 Bitcoins. In 2014, investor Tim Draper, in a similar auction, had purchased nearly 30,000 Bitcoins which were seized from Silk Road marketplace by US Marshals."
2020-02-12 19:30:00+00:00	Top 5 richest Bitcoin owners in the cryptocurrency market	[]	"In 2009, one Bitcoin was worth less than 10 cents. Meanwhile, by December 2017, the Bitcoin price had risen to nearly $ 20,000. At press time, a Bitcoin costs about $ 10,388. Bitcoin price alone has created many billionaires and millionaires in the past eight years. Here are the top ten people/organizations that have held large amounts of Bitcoin over time.

1. Satoshi Nakamoto

Satoshi Nakamoto is known as a person or an organization that created Bitcoin. At the same time, this is also the primary and earliest holder of Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market. The number of Bitcoin Nakamoto owned today is estimated at 1.1 million BTC, equivalent to about $ 11.3 billion at the current Bitcoin price.

However, Nakamoto never touched his Bitcoin number. Nor did he convert them into real-world currencies nor use them for any other purpose. And the fact that no one knows who he is now is it dead … Satoshi Nakamoto seems to have disappeared since the creation of the Bitcoin network and has only appeared a few times since. If he/she sells all of it, the value of Bitcoin can plummet immediately.

2. Bulgaria

Bulgaria is currently sitting on a vast treasure. So, how can a European nation own this enormous amount of money? In May 2017, after an organized crime crackdown by Bulgarian law enforcement, police confiscated 213,519 Bitcoin. This amount is currently worth about $ 2.2 billion, enough to pay a quarter of the country’s national debt.

According to Bulgarian authorities, criminals used tricks to evade taxes. However, the Bulgarian government declined to comment on the status of the above Bitcoin.

3. The Winklevoss twins

Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss were among the first Bitcoin billionaires. The duo first became famous when they sued Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea of ​​creating Facebook from them. As the Winklevoss brothers presented, they were contacted by Zuckerberg to develop ConnectU, later renamed to Facebook.

They used $ 11 million in the $ 65 million compensation they received from a legal dispute with Zuckerberg to buy 1.5 million Bitcoins in 2013. Previously, one Bitcoin was trading at $ 120. That investment has increased by more than 20000% since then.

The twins are said to own about 1% of the total Bitcoin in circulation. Their combined net worth is about 400 million. They created Windex, funded several Bitcoin-related ventures, and invested $ 1.5 million in BitInstant.

4. BitFinex

BitFinex is a cryptocurrency exchange, owning one of the largest Bitcoin wallets with 163,133.38 Bitcoin. This Bitcoin is worth about $ 1.6 billion, with the current price being $ 10,388/BTC. The coins are said to be kept in cold wallets to protect them from cyber attacks, unauthorized access, and other vulnerabilities that a system connected to the internet tends to.

5. FBI

The FBI is one of the biggest notorious Bitcoin holders. In September 2013, they brought down Silk Road, the well-known black web drug market and seized 144,000 Bitcoin owned by website operator Ross Ulbricht, known as Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht made severe mistakes, making it easy for investigators to locate the site and link him to it.

Silk Road users are believed to have traded about 9.5 million Bitcoins since Ulbricht launched the site in 2011. Some even think that the FBI has sold large amounts of their Bitcoin holdings or also is all the FBI value mentioned when they have some money in Bitcoin points. A large portion of the Bitcoin confiscated and sold was transferred to Barry Silbert.

There are still many other Bitcoin billionaires and millionaires

In addition to the five characters above / organizations, AZCoin News will mention five more names that also belong to the list of people who have become so creamy thanks to Bitcoin. In sixth place is Garvin Andresen – one of the people credited with creating Bitcoin today. Garvin is one of the suspected Satoshi Nakamoto, but he denied it. Instead, Andresen said he only had a close relationship with Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto chose him as his successor in late 2010. Garvin became the leading developer of open-source determining how Bitcoin works. The Bitcoin Foundation had paid him more than $ 200,000 for his contributions, but he cashed out quite a lot.

The next names are:

Roger Ver, also known as Bitcoin Jesus, was one of the first Bitcoin billionaires and is said to hold or hold at least 100,000 Bitcoin.

Barry Silbert, a venture capitalist and founder of Digital Currency Group. He was the first to accept Bitcoin. He purportedly walked away with an eye-watering 48,000 Bitcoins in an auction held by the US Marshals Service in 2014.

Charlie Shrem, one of the most controversial Bitcoin millionaires. He invested in a large amount of Bitcoin during the early days of cryptocurrencies. At the end of December 2014, Shrem was convicted of money laundering and received a two-year prison term. Although he did not disclose exactly how many bitcoins he owned, he said he bought several thousand BTC when they were worth several hundred.

Tony Gallippi, a famous business tycoon, is said to be one of the major Bitcoin holders. He is the brain behind BitPay, one of the most popular Bitcoin payment service providers in the world. Bitpay is also one of the companies contracted with major companies, including Microsoft, Dell, TigerDirect, and Newegg. In 2014, the company employed about 100 people.

Currently, there are 153,000 Bitcoin addresses with ten or more BTC. Surprisingly, these addresses represent only 0.57% of the total number of wallets in the market, holding more than 15,400,000 BTC. This number accounts for nearly 75% of the total BTC that will exist in the market. There are also 140,596 more affluent addresses than $ 100,000. Only four addresses have more than 100,000 coins, which is generally uncommon. If exchanges want to hold money, they often have different wallets to do so, not one. These can be huge whales who want money in their wallets only.

The top 5 inactive addresses that held BTC for over five years accounted for 1.2% of the total amount on the market. These addresses hold 212.40 BTC, indicating that there are large whales currently holding Bitcoin and waiting until the price of this virtual currency will reach a higher price. Most of these accounts have large deposits but small withdrawals.

Many of these wallets are anonymous, which means the market does not know who these funds belong to. Crypto hedge funds, exchanges, and significant investors are often behind these wallets.

Crypto Trade Execution: What type of trader are you?

Welcome back to The Market Series. The topic of execution touches on how traders evaluate, strategize, and place orders on the exchange to maximize their profits and minimize losses.

Price vs. Execution Risk

A trader faces two types of risk when submitting an order:

Price risk — the risk that your order may move the market price and result in a trade at an unfavorable price. Price risk is also referred to as slippage .

Execution risk — the risk that your order will not execute entirely, or at all, because the price you are advertising may not match with another trader.

Everyone has different sensitivities when it comes to price and execution risk. If you’re determined to win an auction no matter what, you might choose to pay a higher, Buy-it-Now price. In this case, you’re said to have low sensitivity to price risk, but high sensitivity to execution risk. Conversely, that toothpaste you ordered online doesn’t need to arrive tomorrow for an extra $5 shipping fee. Here, you are said to have high sensitivity to price risk and low sensitivity to execution risk.

Notice, though, that price risk and execution risk are really just a set of tradeoffs. Traders that want to execute a transaction right now often need to sacrifice their price sensitivity, and traders who want to manage their price risk carefully must give up their sensitivity to execution risk. Traders accomplish this through order types.

Order Types

We’ve previously described an order as a set of instructions. These instructions indicate basic information like whether you’d like to buy or sell an asset and for what price. An order type represents a pre-configured instruction form that allows traders to include additional criteria tailored to manage their execution risk.

Kraken offers four order types: Market, Limit, Stop Loss, and Take Profit. Below we will cover the first two basic order types and provide some context on the primary motivations for using each one.

Market Orders

Order Instruction Description Asset & Market Buy or Sell Quantity Market orders immediately match with available orders advertised in the orderbook. These orders carry the highest price risk, as they will take at any price posted on the orderbook. For this same reason, they incur the lowest execution risk. Traders use market orders to nearly guarantee * that they will execute their trade.

*Market orders may not fully execute if the market order is for a quantity larger than all of the combined, advertised orders in the orderbook, an unlikely event.

Limit Orders

Order Instruction Description Asset & Market Buy or Sell Quantity Limit orders require a trader to designate a limit price . For buy orders, this is the highest price the trader is willing to pay; for sell orders, this is the lowest price the trader is willing to accept. Limit orders carry lower price risk because traders can explicitly choose their price. However, they have higher execution risk as the order may not be marketable , or immediately matched with bids and asks in the orderbook. For example, a trader placing a limit order to buy bitcoin for $500 per bitcoin while the market value is $10,000 per bitcoin will have to wait for a significant decrease in market prices before their buy order is executed. However, intuitively, as limit orders designate a price, it can also be placed such that execution risk is low to none. For example, if a trader placed a limit order to buy bitcoin for $10,000 per bitcoin when the orderbook ask volume is heavily filled at $10,000, it is likely to be matched immediately. This shows that limits orders can carry low execution risk, if desired.

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders

Order Instruction Description Asset & Market Buy or Sell Quantity Stop Loss Price A stop loss order allows a trader to designate a stop loss price that triggers a sale when the market price crosses a chosen threshold. Traders use stop loss orders to limit their potential losses from a certain position. Because stop losses triggers a market order, this trade carries a higher price risk (because you cannot be guaranteed a specific sale price) and lower execution risk (because you know that trade will be settled).

Order Instruction Description Asset & Market Buy or Sell Quantity Take Profit Price A take profit order allows a trader to designate a take profit price that triggers a market order when the market price exceeds a chosen threshold. Traders often use take profit orders to lock in profits by placing a market sell order if prices rise to the trigger level. Since take profits also trigger a market order, this trade carries a high price risk and low execution risk. Take profit orders also execute as taker transactions.

Next time…

We’ve now covered the basics on markets, orderbooks, trading, and execution! These topics represent the foundational elements to market structure. First, we conceptualized markets and described orderbooks as a forum for traders to advertise bids and asks. Then we defined a trade as a confirmed exchange between a buyer and a seller that have agreed on a price. Here, we discussed how traders consider the process of execution in their trading decisions. In our next post, we’ll build off of these concepts and discuss liquidity and market impact, so that we can get into more advanced topics and thorough market structure analysis. Stay tuned!

Green investment vehicles are limited by multiple market failures, such as high transaction costs for certification and monitoring, and high minimum investment sizes. In this exploratory study, we apply an inductive approach based on qualitative evidence from expert feedback to assess the potential of blockchain-based security tokens to address these market failures. The tokenization of real assets or debt/equity instruments reduces transaction costs through disintermediation and automation, enhances transparency, and reduces size and liquidity requirements due to lower transaction costs. The main constraints to the adoption of tokenized securities are software risk, regulatory uncertainty, and immature investment infrastructure. These constraints can be addressed by decision- and policy makers in Asia. Through developing pilot use cases and establishing regulatory sandboxes for tokenized securities, valuable experiences and stakeholder feedback can be merged into coherent regulatory and investment frameworks. Even though tokenized securities are a nascent technology and currently limited by immaturities, it is important to consider and develop this financing mechanism in a proactive manner, given its high potential to democratize green finance.
