2020-02-25 10:05:26+00:00	Crypto market sees extensive bloodbath as Bitcoin reaches key level	['Cole Petersen', 'Chainwire', 'News Desk', 'Samuel Wan', 'Andjela Radmilac', 'Joseph Young', 'Ali Martinez']	"After a futile attempt to kick off another uptrend yesterday, the crypto market has seen an intense selloff that has stemmed from Bitcoin’s move down to $9,500, which has subsequently led most major altcoins to plummet lower.

This bloodbath has led most major cryptocurrencies to form an incredibly close correlation to Bitcoin, and it is highly probable that where the aggregated market heads next will be dependent on whether or not BTC is able to hold above a key level that it is currently trading at.

If the benchmark crypto breaks below this level, it could spark a market-wide selloff that leads many major altcoins to invalidate the bullish market structures they have formed over the past several weeks.

Crypto market sees intense selloff following Bitcoin’s bearish rejection

Yesterday, Bitcoin attempted to make a move up to $10,000 that was met with significant selling pressure, subsequently leading BTC to plummet towards $9,500.

This rejection sent shockwaves throughout the aggregated crypto market, with many altcoins that were previously expressing bullishness to see notable selloffs.

At the time of writing, Tezos and Chainlink – two of the best performing altcoins in 2020–are leading today’s drop, trading down 8 percent and 7.5 percent respectively.

Most other altcoins are closely trailing these losses, with Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, and others all trading down roughly 6 percent.

The only major cryptocurrency that has been able to dodge losses of this magnitude is Ethereum, which is trading down just under 3 percent.

Where altcoins go next depends on how Bitcoin reacts to one key level

Today’s selloff has led Bitcoin to a key support level at $9,550 that bulls are currently attempting to defend, and a drop below this level could open the gates for significantly further near-term losses.

Big Chonis, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, spoke about this key level in a recent tweet, referencing the level seen on the below chart.

“Very important area that Bitcoin bulls want to hold…Has acted as support to resistance and back to support… weekly!”

In the near-term, how deep the ongoing altcoin selloff extends will likely rest largely on whether BTC is able to further extend its upwards momentum, as a failure to do so will likely lead investors to flee their altcoin positions in favor of BTC."
2020-02-22 10:35:25+00:00	Can the Total Crypto Market Cap Hit $10 trillion by 2023?	[]	"Popular YouTube crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, has been considering the logarithmic regression band for the total cryptocurrency market cap in his latest video, and based on his analysis, thinks that the total digital asset market cap could hit $10 trillion during the next bull run.

What’s A Logarithmic Regression Band?

While it may sound like AI-generated musicians for psychotherapists to relax to, the logarithmic regression band is actually the range of values to which the crypto market tends to fall back when it is not in a bubble. It is represented by the green band on the chart below.

The line forms a smooth curve overtime when plotted against a logarithmic value scale. At the peak of the 2017-2018 bubble/burst cycle, the total crypto market cap came very close to $1 trillion. However, it has since fallen back to the regression band and currently stands at around $290 billion.

Diminishing Returns Each Crypto Market Cycle

Plotting the difference between the total market cap and the lowest point of the regression band over time shows that the peak levels are becoming lower with each market cycle. This supports the theory of diminishing returns over time.

Assuming this behavior continues, we can project a potential peak level above the regression band for the next major bull run. As an example, Cowen projects this happening in 2022, but of course, it could be earlier or later than this, if it happens at all.

The potential outcome of this would be a total cryptocurrency market cap of around $10 trillion at the peak of the next bubble. In this scenario market cap is likely to oscillate within the regression band for a while before starting its climb.

But What About $100 Trillion Bitcoin?

Ah yes, according to PlanB’s stock to flow (S2F) model, the Bitcoin market cap alone is projected to go to $100 trillion. Cowen’s $10 Trillion market cap peak for the entire crypto market doesn’t sound so impressive against that prediction.

Of course, the $100 trillion Bitcoin is still some way off in the future. The projected price increases in the S2F model happen because of the artificial limiting of supply over time. The next halving will happen in May this year.

However, the $100 trillion projection isn’t due until another two halvings after that, or sometime in 2028. So, for now, a $10 trillion market cap by 2022 will have to do.

At current Bitcoin dominance levels, a $10 trillion total crypto market cap gives a BTC price of around $330,000, so that’s something to look forward to.

2020-02-20 14:03:27+00:00	Top Analyst: Foul Play Pumped the Crypto Market by $66 Billion	"['Yashu Gola Is A Mumbai-Based Finance Journalist. He Is Profoundly Active In The Bitcoin Space Since', 'Has Contributed To Several Cryptocurrency Media Outlets', 'Including Newsbtc', 'Fxdailyreport', 'Bitcoinist', 'Ccn. Academically', ""Yashu Holds A Bachelor'S In Information Technology"", 'With Majors In Data Structures', 'C', ""Programming Language. He Has Also Won The 'Atulya Award' For His Efforts Towards Raising""]"	"Jacob Canfield, a crypto market analyst known for accurately predicting bitcoin’s 2020 price rally, has alleged that there was market manipulation in the trading of altcoins this year.

In a video published last week, Mr. Canfield linked the resurgence of otherwise underperforming cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and EOS to PlusToken, a Ponzi scheme that, under the disguise of a high yield investment company, stole over $3 billion from its clients. The steal included 70,000 bitcoin, 790,000 ether, and 26 million EOS tokens.

Mr. Canfield noted that PlusToken scammers first artificially pumped bitcoin from $3,500 to circa $14,000 last year. They then sold about 70-90K BTC in the range of $9,000 and $13,000, which roughly equals about $600 million. The profitable move gave them enough capital to drive the altcoin market upward.

“If [Plustoken scammers] are using their capital to push the Ethereum market, then they can push its prices back to $300, $500, $600 and even $1,000,” said Mr. Canfield. “They can also set up traps for short-sellers and continue to push the short-seller cascade in thin-order markets.”

The statements came at the time when altcoins are severely outperforming their top rival bitcoin. Ethereum and EOS, for instance, surged by up to 130 and 155 percent after bottoming out in December 2019. In the same timeframe, bitcoin surged by up to 63 percent only.

On the whole, the crypto market – excluding bitcoin – attracted up to circa $66 billion between December 2019 until February 2020 top.

Mr. Canfield theorized that PlusToken scammers are using cryptocurrency exchanges and OTC brokers with closed order-books to trade their steal for alternative crypto tokens. The analyst further admitted that he has stopped entering short leveraged positions over his fears of fat price dumps.

Crypto Trend Will Continue

Despite fears of a massive dump, Mr. Canfield believed the crypto market will keep rising. The analyst recommended traders to identify near-term dips to buy Ethereum, EOS or other altcoins but exit their positions on the first signs of deep pullbacks.

He further advised traders to watch the crypto wallets that belong to the scammers associated with PlusToken, noting that any kind of small or big withdrawal would alert them of a potential bearish correction."

2020-02-10 16:15:36+00:00	Bitcoin Whale Gives Warning About Inflated Market	[]	"One of the leading traders on Bitfinex and a notable Bitcoin whale has given a warning about the impact of ‘phantom money’ on the market.

How much of cryptocurrency trading is real? By some estimates, only a small fraction of the entire market. A bombshell report in March 2019 found that around 95% of the entire market is fake, as BeInCrypto has previously reported. Since then, exchanges and various exchange data sites have put in stricter reporting standards with metrics like ‘real liquidity.’

Despite these changes, however, one whale claims that the market is still incredibly ‘inflated.’ Joe007 (@J0E007) is a prominent Bitcoin whale in the cryptocurrency world. Often known for topping Bitfinex leaderboards, he’s also been outspoken on rumors in the industry—and often doesn’t hold back criticism.

As Bitcoin breaks the $10,000 price point and the entire market rallies, Joe007 criticized the amount of so-called “phantom money” in the market. He writes: “At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show.”

You can push the price only so long with fantom money. At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show. — Joe007 signals·alerts·funds are scams, all of them (@J0E007) February 9, 2020

However, recent metrics seem to contradict Joe007’s claim about this rally being based on the so-called ‘phantom money.’ On-chain investor activity has increased significantly parallel to this rally, as also reported by BeInCrypto. This didn’t happen when Bitcoin broke $10,000 in the summer of 2019, so there’s no reason to believe that this rally is less legitimate than others.

Joe007 is known for stirring the pot on Twitter and causing controversy. For example, last month Joe007 claimed that Binance was outright faking their numbers. He’s also taken issue with Huobi and OKEx faking their reported trading stats as well. A known critic of Bitcoin SV (BSV), Joe007 has also said that BSV delistings may have helped the coin ‘scam pump’ much easier due to low liquidity.

Whether or not Joe007 is correct about the cryptocurrency market’s current rally remains to be seen. As of now, Bitcoin has dropped down under the $10,000 price point and is currently trading at around $9,800."

Georgi'S Passion For Bitcoin"", 'Cryptocurrencies Bloomed In Late', ""He Hasn'T Looked Back Since. Crypto S Technological"", 'Economic Implications Are What Interest Him Most', 'He Has One Eye Turned To The Market Whenever He S Not Sleeping.']"	"The cryptocurrency market shows no signs of slowing down so far in 2020. After charting one of the most impressive performances in January, Bitcoin continues its rally in the first week of February as well. In the past seven days, the cryptocurrency increased by about 5.5%, claiming essential resistance levels on the way up. Currently trading at around $9,800, all eyes are on the critical psychological barrier of $10,000.

Bitcoin’s price was rangebound in the first few days of the week, and it dipped to as low as $9120 on Tuesday, February 4th. From there, however, it was all uphill. The cryptocurrency charted a high of around $9,900 and retraced a bit to $9,800. The market sentiment is particularly bullish as $10,000 seems in sight.

It’s not just Bitcoin, though. Altcoins are surging as well. Bitcoin’s dominance has decreased down to 63.9%, which means that other cryptocurrencies manage to claim serious grounds.

As seen in the above picture, not only are altcoins in the red, but almost all of them are marking double-digit increases in the past seven days. Ethereum has had an impressive performance, surging upwards of 23%, while XRP follows closely with 17%. An interesting survey revealed that 50% of cryptocurrency traders hold mainly altcoins over Bitcoin at this time.

In a broader view, the trend of government-backed cryptocurrencies continues. Federal Governor Lael Brainard recently said that the US is looking closely at launching its own. Japan is also reported to move forward with its plans to avoid falling behind China.
