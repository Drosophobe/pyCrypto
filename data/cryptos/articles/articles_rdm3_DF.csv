On Sept. 13, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed legislation that would close a tax loophole for cryptocurrency investors by imposing ""wash sale"" rules on commodities, currencies and digital assets, according to a released outline. Currently, investors can sell cryptocurrency for a loss and claim a tax benefit. Then, investors can immediately buy back the asset if it rebounds. So-called ""wash sale"" rules would prevent investors from buying the same asset back right away. Subjecting cryptocurrency and other assets to this proposed change would raise $16.8 billion over a decade, according to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

2. Senators demand cryptocurrency regulation guidance from SEC

On Tuesday, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the Senate Banking Committee that the SEC is working overtime to create a set of rules for cryptocurrency markets to protect investors. ""Currently, we just don't have enough investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading, or lending,"" Gensler said in prepared remarks. ""Frankly, at this time, it's more like the Wild West or the old world of 'buyer beware' that existed before the securities laws were enacted."" Some lawmakers also pressed Gensler about whether certain crypto assets, like stablecoins, meet the definition of a security, which has been an ongoing subject of concern and confusion for regulators and the crypto community.

3. Ray Dalio says if bitcoin is really successful, regulators will ‘kill it’

On Wednesday, Ray Dalio told CNBC that he believes that regulators would ultimately take control of bitcoin if the cryptocurrency is successful. ""I think at the end of the day if it's really successful, they will kill it and they will try to kill it. And I think they will kill it because they have ways of killing it,"" Dalio told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the SALT conference. ""You have El Salvador taking it on and you have India and China getting rid of it. And you have the United States talking about how to regulate it and it could still be controlled,"" he said. Still, Dalio disclosed that he has ""a certain amount of money in bitcoin,"" but noted that the allocation is smaller than his gold exposure. ""It's an amazing accomplishment to have brought it from where that programming occurred to where it is through the test of time,"" he said.

Crypto markets have dropped a great deal in value over the last 24 hours as crypto assets across the board have lost anywhere between 7-15% in value during this time period. The overall market valuation of all 10,000+ crypto-assets in existence has slid just below the $2 trillion handle, losing over 9% in value during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Economy Slips by 9% During the Last 24 Hours

Bitcoin (BTC) prices were above the $48K zone on Sunday, September 19, but the following day, BTC prices are much lower as the crypto asset dropped to a low of $42,660 per unit on Monday. BTC has shed 8.9% in value and the digital asset’s market valuation is around $815 billion today. At the time of writing, a single BTC is swapping for just above $43K per coin.

The second-leading crypto asset, ethereum (ETH) has dropped 10.3% in value during the last day and each ether is exchanging hands for just above $3K per unit. ETH has an overall market valuation of around $355.4 billion on Monday.

The biggest loser out of the top ten crypto-asset market positions is XRP, shedding 13.8% during the course of the last day. Bitcoin’s (BTC) 8% loss is the least of all the percentage losses on Monday. Just before BTC’s slide below $45K, Etoro’s crypto analyst discussed the current market events.

“Bitcoin and ether both experienced a weekend slip after a week of climbing back to previous highs,” Simon Peters, Etoro’s crypto analyst wrote in a note to Bitcoin.com News on Monday morning. “BTC began the week below $45,000 after the flash crash of the week before. Having risen across the week to near $49,000 levels the price collapsed again on Sunday, falling away to now trade around $45,500.” Peters added:

Likewise, ETH began the week trading around $3,200 before rising to a high of $3,652 on Thursday. The token began a decline earlier than bitcoin though, falling away from Thursday and across the weekend to now trade below $3,200, a 13% decline.

Cosmos Remains Unscathed, Fears of Economic Turmoil Stemming from Evergrande Collapse and Default Risks Rise

Overall, the entire crypto market cap has lost over 9% in fiat value between Sunday and Monday. The top coins being traded include nine different stablecoins. Besides the stablecoin action today, the coin that took the least amount of fiat loss is cosmos (ATOM). Cosmos only lost 0.9% on Monday and is up over 9% for the last seven days. The biggest loser today is Algorand (ALGO) losing 16.6% during the last 24 hours.

Cryptocurrency markets have followed the drop across all global markets on Monday as a few warnings of economic turmoil have arisen. For instance, news outlets detail that the U.S. may default on financial obligations which could turn into another financial crisis.

The secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Janet Yellen, has warned of a debt ceiling fallout. Furthermore, global stock markets are in the red over China Evergrande shares dropping like a rock. Evergrande shares saw an 11-year low and speculators have claimed the Evergrande collapse could be like the next Lehman Brothers crisis.

New Delhi: The largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is currently down by 4.5% over the past 24 hours and has been trading around $45,463. Bitcoin touched its all-time high mark of $64,000 in April. Other popular coins like Dogecoin, XRP, and Cardano also dropped in value along with the world’s most famous coin.

As we all know the nature of the crypto market is very volatile where you can see large swings or a sudden fall with no notice, thus people find it very risky to invest in this space. An upward trend can work wonders for you if you have invested in the right coin and a downswing can leave you with less amount of money than you invested.

Ether is at $3,120 with a change of -9.36% over the last 24 hours

Cardano is at $2.1 with a change of -10% over the last 24 hours

Binance Coin is at $384 with a change of -6.7% over the last 24 hours

XRP is at 0.9602 with a change of -11% over the last 24 hours

Solana is at 140 with a change of -13% over the last 24 hours

Why the crypto market is down?

The Crypto market has already suffered series of blows apart from its regular volatility and it is difficult to mark a common problem that can state that why markets are down today.

But reports are coming through many sources that U.S. officials are looking into whether Binance or its staff profited from taking advantage of its users. The review will involve Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigators which will reach out to potential witnesses in the recent weeks."

This indicated a 20.13 per cent increase for the same. With that said, there are a few cryptocurrencies, other than the usual Bitcoin, who are which are worth mentioning as they have seen significant gains over the last 24 hours as per information on CoinMarketCap.

Keeping this in mind, here are the top five gainers that the cryptocurrency market has witnessed over the course of the last day.

Top 5 Cryptocurrency Gainers (According to data from CoinMarketCap)

1) Aqua Pig – $ 0.000000000014 – 689.25 per cent change over the last 24 hours

5) InfinityCake – $0.0000007175 – 192.92 per cent change over the last 24 hours

On the other end of the cryptocurrency spectrum, we have the top ghost coins dominating the market. These include the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and so on. It should be noted that a majority of the top coins, including Bitcoin, have displayed a tendency to trade red, especially at the time of this article. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin, all top coins in the market, have been trading red over the past 24 hours. In most of the cases, they have also been trading red over the course of the past 7 days as per information on CoinMarketCap.

As per the data that was analysed, Bitcoin was trading at $45,093.11 which was 6.50 per cent down over the last 24 hours and 1.45 per cent up over the course of the week. The second most popular cryptocurrency, Ether was trading at $3,164.36 or an 8.09 per cent decline over the course of the last day. The coin was trading 1.58 per cent lower over the course of the last seven days. Cardano, Tether and Binance Coin took third, fourth and fifth place respectively.

Speaking on the performance of the top cryptocurrency, ZebPay Trade Desk said, “Bitcoin (BTC) has been fairly range-bound over the last couple of days, trading between $45,000 – $48,000. This seems to be a consolidating phase that the asset is operating in, and the bears are preventing the asset from crossing the $48,000 mark convincingly, making this a strong psychological resistance level for BTC.”

Apart from these, Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, the so-called ‘meme coins’, have garnered a lot of interest and attention over the past couple of months thanks to Tesla CEO and billionaire, Elon Musk. This all started when Musk took to Twitter to announce the arrival of his new Shiba Inu puppy that he named Floki. Soon after that both the Dogecoin and the SHIBA coin saw a dramatic jump in prices as the infamous ‘Musk’ effect took hold of the cryptocurrency market once again. This saw Dogecoin reach all the way to 9th place amongst the top crypto coins in the market. As of today it once again slipped down one space though and stood at a price of $0.2159 and was trading at 9.69 per cent down over the course of the past 24 hours.

NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency prices sank on Monday as concerns over the spillover risk to the global economy from Chinese property group Evergrande's (3333.HK) troubles spread across financial markets.

Bitcoin , the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, tumbled to $42,453.97, its lowest level since Aug. 7 before trimming some losses to trade down 7.4% at $43,745. It hit a near four-month high above $52,000 on Sept. 6.

Smaller rival ether , the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, fell more than 10% below $3,000 for the first time since early August. It was last down 7.6% at $3,071.

Market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market dropped 10% on Monday to under $1.94 trillion, from last Saturday's $2.17 trillion.

The loss in the value of cryptocurrencies comes at a time when institutional interest in the space has surged and some investment banks have ramped up their forecasts for cryptocurrencies in the coming months.

""It's red, red, red across the board today as the cryptocurrency markets follow the downturn being seen in traditional markets as China battles a highly-contagious property market crisis,"" said Tim Frost, chief executive officer at Yield App, a financial technology company that enables users to invest in decentralized finance.

""Bitcoin has lost support at the $44,000 mark and looks set to test its $39,000 floor. If it falls through here we can expect a significant correction to come,"" he added.

Bitcoin shorts in the futures markets have increased to 1,187 contracts , the largest since early August, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released Friday.

Lachlan Holds A Bachelor S Degree In Journalism Macleay College In Australia.']	"The cryptocurrency market has rebounded in the past 24 hours as news broke that China Evergrande Group, the second largest property developer in the world’s most populous nation, has taken a step back from falling off a potential debt cliff today.

Fast facts

While the overall cryptocurrency market is still down for the week, all major tokens saw a significant price bump early this morning Asia time, with Solana and Polkadot being the biggest movers in the top 10, each up 17% in the 24 hours before publishing time, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum prices were up 5% and 9%, respectively, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency resuming above US$43K and Ether reaching US$3K early this morning, Asia time. Cardano recovered 11%, regaining its third spot position that it had lost to Tether in Tuesday’s market crash, and is trading at US$2.28 at publishing time.

Uncertainty about Evergrande’s ability to meet bond repayments sent global markets reeling earlier this week, with the prospects of a default and any domino effects evoking comparisons to the Lehman Brother collapse that triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.

Evergrande announced Wednesday that it has resolved one coupon payment — a Shenzhen-traded 5.8% bond that matures in 2025 — that was due today. Global markets and not just crypto responded positively to the news, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all showing strong recovery in the past 24 hours. The celebrations could yet prove short-lived, however; as it is still uncertain if the indebted firm can pay a different US$83.5 million bond payment due today. Evergrande also has another US$475.5 million payment for March 2024 notes due on Sept. 29."
2021-09-08 02:31:04+00:00	Why Bitcoin, ether, other crypto prices are crashing	[]	"Bitcoin prices plummeted from more than $52,000 per coin, over 17% to $42,000, before recovering about half of that loss after El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday. However, the rollout stumbled in its first hours and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

Tuesday’s selloff is the most significant break in the rebound that had lifted Bitcoin almost 75% since late July. Overall cryptocurrency market value fell about $300 billion in the past 24 hours, according to tracker CoinGecko.

The world's largest cryptocurrency staged a small recovery as Bitcoin prices today were at around $46,757, down 11%. Meanwhile, other digital coins followed the lead with ether fell over 11% to $3,471 whereas dogecoin and cardano prices plunged 15% and 12% to $0.26 and $2.5 respectively. Stellar, XRP, Uniswap also crashed in the range of 15-20% over the last 24 hours.

“Social media platforms were very cautious over the weekend that a plunge could occur following El Salvador’s big day,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., wrote in a note, as reported by Bloomberg. Some investors likely bought in anticipation of the nation implementing its Bitcoin law Sept. 7 and then moved to “sell the fact,"" he said.

According to experts, bitcoin was still in the bull market as long the price stayed above the $43,000 level.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings and a long-time cryptocurrency bull, told Bloomberg the market for digital coins was running strong over the last eight weeks and became overbought. Interest from individual investors spiked on the back of large institutions jumping on board the crypto wagon, he said.

David Gerard, author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,"" told the Associated Press that Tuesday’s Bitcoin volatility likely had little to nothing to do with El Salvador. “My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

“Bitcoin basically doesn’t respond to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard said. “That sort of price pattern, where it crashes hugely in minutes then goes back up again, is usually one of the big guys burning the margin traders."" Because Bitcoin is so thinly traded, it could also have been a big holder making a large sale to have cash, thus sending the market for a ride, Gerard said.

2021-09-29 19:25:30+00:00	Regulating the unregulated cryptocurrency market	['Christina Pazzanese', 'Harvard Staff Writer']	"Is cryptocurrency the future of global banking and trade, or a sketchy payment and investment vehicle favored by scammers and speculators, criminal organizations, and any individual or entity shut out of Western banking systems, like North Korea?

The jury is still out. One thing that is clear, however, is that the cryptocurrency market continues to grow as its popularity has become more mainstream since 2019. Even many once-skeptical institutional investors have come around after seeing some of the mind-boggling returns. In January 2019, one Bitcoin traded for $3,441; this week, it hit $43,136.

But that success may have a price. Calls to rein in the industry are at fever pitch. This month China, one of the world’s largest digital currency markets, outlawed all crypto-related transactions. It banned trading them in 2019. The U.S. Treasury said this week it will sanction a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time for facilitating ransomware payments. New tax and trading rules for the industry are included in legislation Congress is scheduled to vote on by week’s end. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also pushing for greater enforcement. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler called cryptocurrency an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse” and said investors don’t have enough regulatory protection from the swarms jumping into crypto finance, issuance, trading, and lending.

Q&A

Scott Duke Kominers

GAZETTE: There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, but no consensus on the precise number. The range is between 5,000 and 12,000, valued at about $2 trillion. What does the landscape look like today?

KOMINERS: Those numbers sound huge, but there are actually many, many more than that because lots of crypto products are not currencies and lots of cryptocurrencies are too small to be part of mainstream exchanges. Many crypto products are effectively just tokens. Sometimes these are representative of ownership in decentralized autonomous organizations, which are organizations that share governance rights and returns to a committee of participants by allocating them tokens — a bit like stock shares. There are project-specific tokens used in specific online games or among individual communities. There are NFTs, which are unique non-fungible tokens that have been used as representing ownership over things like digital artworks. Tons of these are being minted daily at this point. So, there is a very large landscape. The pure currency aspect of it is a huge market on its own, but a drop in the bucket of the total applications of crypto and blockchain technology today.

GAZETTE: What’s the appeal for investors? Is it just the eye-popping returns or is there more to it?

KOMINERS: Some people have gotten interested in cryptocurrency because of the investment returns, unquestionably. But there are also real, practical infrastructure and technology benefits. You’re starting to see countries willing to receive officially recognized crypto payments. And people have been considering whether crypto technology can be used to deliver government aid. This is because when it’s working, crypto is frictionless, and thus creates a much more efficient way of transferring and sharing value among people. And, as a result, there’s a real opportunity to use crypto for large-scale payments, as well as in things like small business payment processing. Also, there’s a big opportunity for enhancing financial inclusion, by providing secure payment networks and cross-border transfers in places that don’t otherwise have well-structured consumer financial systems. So, while some people are interested in this for the short- or medium-term investment opportunity, I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.

GAZETTE: The SEC chairman called this an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.” Is this industry operating in a rule-free, “Wild West” atmosphere, as he suggested?

KOMINERS: I haven’t read the full Gensler remarks, so I can’t comment explicitly on his overall take, but I can comment on some of the individual elements you mention. It’s clear that this space needs much more consumer protection, and we’re starting to see that. Right now, if a hacker gains access to your crypto wallet, they can drain it and you may have no recourse. But the newer waves of wallet technologies and crypto exchanges are thinking hard about all the things consumers expect out of banking products and equities trading accounts. They’re trying to create more security and protections at the consumer-interface level. And then, of course, you also need regulation to prevent financial crime and scams, just like we have in other parts of the financial-services industry.

GAZETTE: Some lawmakers have pointed to the GameStop stock trading frenzy in early 2021 as analogous to the crypto market, saying that most ordinary investors have gotten caught up in hype and don’t fully understand the risks they’re taking.

“I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.”

KOMINERS: First of all, it’s important to note that the GameStop run-up wasn’t in a new trading arena — it was Internet-hyped trading of a specific stock in the regular stock market. That said, the GameStop story is in some sense analogous to the meme trading of crypto products like Dogecoin — there’s consumer confusion around the idea that these assets could lose value. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the GameStop and Dogecoin run-ups and crashes. They were on a platform that made trading feel like a video game, and didn’t understand the real risks. And so in those ways, it’s analogous. Consumers and investors need to understand that these are high variance, speculative assets.

But when you get to the technology infrastructure pieces, GameStop and crypto can look very different. Cryptocurrency trading now looks a lot like equities trading — you have a brokerage account at an exchange, or potentially on a platform like Robinhood. But for many of the other crypto applications, the infrastructure is very, very new, and the platforms are very, very new, and they’re not heavily protected.

I think we’ll see more regulation around messaging and communication, but there are also more structural questions. For example, one of the regulatory conversations is around stablecoins — crypto assets that hold nominally fixed values because they’re designed to just be used for moving money from one place to another in a fixed denomination. They’re typically backed by reserves in a way similar to how banks back their loans with deposits. But there are questions about how to properly structure those reserves. If everyone simultaneously decided they wanted to divest, will stablecoins have the reserves to support that? I expect to see regulation around allowable assets and reserve design — just like we have with banks.

And finally, we’ll need regulation to ensure open competition among different crypto products and platforms.

GAZETTE: Besides fending off regulations, what are the industry’s other challenges?

KOMINERS: One basic challenge is around taxation of crypto income. This isn’t just about tax avoidance concerns — a lot of people would like to pay taxes on their crypto but have absolutely no idea how to do so. We don’t have clear crypto categories for taxation purposes, so it’s extremely complicated to figure out which parts are ordinary income versus capital gains, as well as when the associated income has accrued. Organizing the tax treatment of all these assets — and then, of course, ensuring tax payment — is essential.

Another challenge is environmental: A lot of the most popular crypto technologies at the moment require tremendous amounts of energy to run. And so, we’re going to start seeing government leadership and regulation driving a shift toward versions of this technology that are more environmentally sustainable.

Bitcoin and other early blockchains use a technology where you have to prove that you solved a very hard computational problem to record transactions securely. And solving those computational problems is taking up absurd amounts of energy. Newer blockchains use much less energy-intensive ways of validating transactions. And so, my guess and hope is that the way we’re going to get away from environmentally harmful cryptocurrency transactions is through continual improvements in the technology, alongside regulation and market forces pushing toward technologies that are much more efficient.

GAZETTE: If new regulations are on the way, what would be the best- or worst-case scenarios for the industry?

KOMINERS: I don’t think it’s a question of ‘no regulation’ versus ‘a lot.’ The real question is the extent to which regulators understand that crypto is a different type of product and tech infrastructure from anything they’ve regulated before. The worst case would be to just treat it like historical financial products or like historical tech platforms without thinking about the ways in which crypto differs, both in terms of its use cases and in terms of its underlying technology."
