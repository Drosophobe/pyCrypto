Crypto markets have dropped a great deal in value over the last 24 hours as crypto assets across the board have lost anywhere between 7-15% in value during this time period. The overall market valuation of all 10,000+ crypto-assets in existence has slid just below the $2 trillion handle, losing over 9% in value during the last 24 hours.

Crypto Economy Slips by 9% During the Last 24 Hours

Bitcoin (BTC) prices were above the $48K zone on Sunday, September 19, but the following day, BTC prices are much lower as the crypto asset dropped to a low of $42,660 per unit on Monday. BTC has shed 8.9% in value and the digital asset’s market valuation is around $815 billion today. At the time of writing, a single BTC is swapping for just above $43K per coin.

The second-leading crypto asset, ethereum (ETH) has dropped 10.3% in value during the last day and each ether is exchanging hands for just above $3K per unit. ETH has an overall market valuation of around $355.4 billion on Monday.

The biggest loser out of the top ten crypto-asset market positions is XRP, shedding 13.8% during the course of the last day. Bitcoin’s (BTC) 8% loss is the least of all the percentage losses on Monday. Just before BTC’s slide below $45K, Etoro’s crypto analyst discussed the current market events.

“Bitcoin and ether both experienced a weekend slip after a week of climbing back to previous highs,” Simon Peters, Etoro’s crypto analyst wrote in a note to Bitcoin.com News on Monday morning. “BTC began the week below $45,000 after the flash crash of the week before. Having risen across the week to near $49,000 levels the price collapsed again on Sunday, falling away to now trade around $45,500.” Peters added:

Likewise, ETH began the week trading around $3,200 before rising to a high of $3,652 on Thursday. The token began a decline earlier than bitcoin though, falling away from Thursday and across the weekend to now trade below $3,200, a 13% decline.

Cosmos Remains Unscathed, Fears of Economic Turmoil Stemming from Evergrande Collapse and Default Risks Rise

Overall, the entire crypto market cap has lost over 9% in fiat value between Sunday and Monday. The top coins being traded include nine different stablecoins. Besides the stablecoin action today, the coin that took the least amount of fiat loss is cosmos (ATOM). Cosmos only lost 0.9% on Monday and is up over 9% for the last seven days. The biggest loser today is Algorand (ALGO) losing 16.6% during the last 24 hours.

Cryptocurrency markets have followed the drop across all global markets on Monday as a few warnings of economic turmoil have arisen. For instance, news outlets detail that the U.S. may default on financial obligations which could turn into another financial crisis.

The secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Janet Yellen, has warned of a debt ceiling fallout. Furthermore, global stock markets are in the red over China Evergrande shares dropping like a rock. Evergrande shares saw an 11-year low and speculators have claimed the Evergrande collapse could be like the next Lehman Brothers crisis.

On Sept. 13, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed legislation that would close a tax loophole for cryptocurrency investors by imposing ""wash sale"" rules on commodities, currencies and digital assets, according to a released outline. Currently, investors can sell cryptocurrency for a loss and claim a tax benefit. Then, investors can immediately buy back the asset if it rebounds. So-called ""wash sale"" rules would prevent investors from buying the same asset back right away. Subjecting cryptocurrency and other assets to this proposed change would raise $16.8 billion over a decade, according to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

2. Senators demand cryptocurrency regulation guidance from SEC

On Tuesday, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the Senate Banking Committee that the SEC is working overtime to create a set of rules for cryptocurrency markets to protect investors. ""Currently, we just don't have enough investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading, or lending,"" Gensler said in prepared remarks. ""Frankly, at this time, it's more like the Wild West or the old world of 'buyer beware' that existed before the securities laws were enacted."" Some lawmakers also pressed Gensler about whether certain crypto assets, like stablecoins, meet the definition of a security, which has been an ongoing subject of concern and confusion for regulators and the crypto community.

3. Ray Dalio says if bitcoin is really successful, regulators will ‘kill it’

On Wednesday, Ray Dalio told CNBC that he believes that regulators would ultimately take control of bitcoin if the cryptocurrency is successful. ""I think at the end of the day if it's really successful, they will kill it and they will try to kill it. And I think they will kill it because they have ways of killing it,"" Dalio told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the SALT conference. ""You have El Salvador taking it on and you have India and China getting rid of it. And you have the United States talking about how to regulate it and it could still be controlled,"" he said. Still, Dalio disclosed that he has ""a certain amount of money in bitcoin,"" but noted that the allocation is smaller than his gold exposure. ""It's an amazing accomplishment to have brought it from where that programming occurred to where it is through the test of time,"" he said.

The global crypto market cap at the time of this article stood at $1.99 trillion which points to a 7.60 per cent decline over the course of the last day, according to information on CoinMarketCap. However, contrary to this, the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours has aggregated to a total of $101.78 billion at the time of writing this article. This indicated a 20.13 per cent increase for the same. With that said, there are a few cryptocurrencies, other than the usual Bitcoin, who are which are worth mentioning as they have seen significant gains over the last 24 hours as per information on CoinMarketCap.

Keeping this in mind, here are the top five gainers that the cryptocurrency market has witnessed over the course of the last day.

Top 5 Cryptocurrency Gainers (According to data from CoinMarketCap)

1) Aqua Pig – $ 0.000000000014 – 689.25 per cent change over the last 24 hours

2) Gravitoken – $0.02383 – 263.75 per cent change over the last 24 hours

3) CONTRACOIN – $0.2553 – 237.84 per cent change over the last 24 hour

4) SafeBull – $0.00000001228 – 225.76 per cent change over the last 24 hours

5) InfinityCake – $0.0000007175 – 192.92 per cent change over the last 24 hours

On the other end of the cryptocurrency spectrum, we have the top ghost coins dominating the market. These include the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and so on. It should be noted that a majority of the top coins, including Bitcoin, have displayed a tendency to trade red, especially at the time of this article. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin, all top coins in the market, have been trading red over the past 24 hours. In most of the cases, they have also been trading red over the course of the past 7 days as per information on CoinMarketCap.

As per the data that was analysed, Bitcoin was trading at $45,093.11 which was 6.50 per cent down over the last 24 hours and 1.45 per cent up over the course of the week. The second most popular cryptocurrency, Ether was trading at $3,164.36 or an 8.09 per cent decline over the course of the last day. The coin was trading 1.58 per cent lower over the course of the last seven days. Cardano, Tether and Binance Coin took third, fourth and fifth place respectively.

Speaking on the performance of the top cryptocurrency, ZebPay Trade Desk said, “Bitcoin (BTC) has been fairly range-bound over the last couple of days, trading between $45,000 – $48,000. This seems to be a consolidating phase that the asset is operating in, and the bears are preventing the asset from crossing the $48,000 mark convincingly, making this a strong psychological resistance level for BTC.”

Apart from these, Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, the so-called ‘meme coins’, have garnered a lot of interest and attention over the past couple of months thanks to Tesla CEO and billionaire, Elon Musk. This all started when Musk took to Twitter to announce the arrival of his new Shiba Inu puppy that he named Floki. Soon after that both the Dogecoin and the SHIBA coin saw a dramatic jump in prices as the infamous ‘Musk’ effect took hold of the cryptocurrency market once again. This saw Dogecoin reach all the way to 9th place amongst the top crypto coins in the market. As of today it once again slipped down one space though and stood at a price of $0.2159 and was trading at 9.69 per cent down over the course of the past 24 hours.

NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency prices sank on Monday as concerns over the spillover risk to the global economy from Chinese property group Evergrande's (3333.HK) troubles spread across financial markets.

Bitcoin , the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, tumbled to $42,453.97, its lowest level since Aug. 7 before trimming some losses to trade down 7.4% at $43,745. It hit a near four-month high above $52,000 on Sept. 6.

Smaller rival ether , the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, fell more than 10% below $3,000 for the first time since early August. It was last down 7.6% at $3,071.

Market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market dropped 10% on Monday to under $1.94 trillion, from last Saturday's $2.17 trillion.

The loss in the value of cryptocurrencies comes at a time when institutional interest in the space has surged and some investment banks have ramped up their forecasts for cryptocurrencies in the coming months.

""It's red, red, red across the board today as the cryptocurrency markets follow the downturn being seen in traditional markets as China battles a highly-contagious property market crisis,"" said Tim Frost, chief executive officer at Yield App, a financial technology company that enables users to invest in decentralized finance.

""Bitcoin has lost support at the $44,000 mark and looks set to test its $39,000 floor. If it falls through here we can expect a significant correction to come,"" he added.

Bitcoin shorts in the futures markets have increased to 1,187 contracts , the largest since early August, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released Friday.

2021-09-29 19:25:30+00:00	Regulating the unregulated cryptocurrency market	['Christina Pazzanese', 'Harvard Staff Writer']	"Is cryptocurrency the future of global banking and trade, or a sketchy payment and investment vehicle favored by scammers and speculators, criminal organizations, and any individual or entity shut out of Western banking systems, like North Korea?

The jury is still out. One thing that is clear, however, is that the cryptocurrency market continues to grow as its popularity has become more mainstream since 2019. Even many once-skeptical institutional investors have come around after seeing some of the mind-boggling returns. In January 2019, one Bitcoin traded for $3,441; this week, it hit $43,136.

But that success may have a price. Calls to rein in the industry are at fever pitch. This month China, one of the world’s largest digital currency markets, outlawed all crypto-related transactions. It banned trading them in 2019. The U.S. Treasury said this week it will sanction a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time for facilitating ransomware payments. New tax and trading rules for the industry are included in legislation Congress is scheduled to vote on by week’s end. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also pushing for greater enforcement. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler called cryptocurrency an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse” and said investors don’t have enough regulatory protection from the swarms jumping into crypto finance, issuance, trading, and lending.

Q&A

Scott Duke Kominers

GAZETTE: There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, but no consensus on the precise number. The range is between 5,000 and 12,000, valued at about $2 trillion. What does the landscape look like today?

KOMINERS: Those numbers sound huge, but there are actually many, many more than that because lots of crypto products are not currencies and lots of cryptocurrencies are too small to be part of mainstream exchanges. Many crypto products are effectively just tokens. Sometimes these are representative of ownership in decentralized autonomous organizations, which are organizations that share governance rights and returns to a committee of participants by allocating them tokens — a bit like stock shares. There are project-specific tokens used in specific online games or among individual communities. There are NFTs, which are unique non-fungible tokens that have been used as representing ownership over things like digital artworks. Tons of these are being minted daily at this point. So, there is a very large landscape. The pure currency aspect of it is a huge market on its own, but a drop in the bucket of the total applications of crypto and blockchain technology today.

GAZETTE: What’s the appeal for investors? Is it just the eye-popping returns or is there more to it?

KOMINERS: Some people have gotten interested in cryptocurrency because of the investment returns, unquestionably. But there are also real, practical infrastructure and technology benefits. You’re starting to see countries willing to receive officially recognized crypto payments. And people have been considering whether crypto technology can be used to deliver government aid. This is because when it’s working, crypto is frictionless, and thus creates a much more efficient way of transferring and sharing value among people. And, as a result, there’s a real opportunity to use crypto for large-scale payments, as well as in things like small business payment processing. Also, there’s a big opportunity for enhancing financial inclusion, by providing secure payment networks and cross-border transfers in places that don’t otherwise have well-structured consumer financial systems. So, while some people are interested in this for the short- or medium-term investment opportunity, I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.

GAZETTE: The SEC chairman called this an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.” Is this industry operating in a rule-free, “Wild West” atmosphere, as he suggested?

KOMINERS: I haven’t read the full Gensler remarks, so I can’t comment explicitly on his overall take, but I can comment on some of the individual elements you mention. It’s clear that this space needs much more consumer protection, and we’re starting to see that. Right now, if a hacker gains access to your crypto wallet, they can drain it and you may have no recourse. But the newer waves of wallet technologies and crypto exchanges are thinking hard about all the things consumers expect out of banking products and equities trading accounts. They’re trying to create more security and protections at the consumer-interface level. And then, of course, you also need regulation to prevent financial crime and scams, just like we have in other parts of the financial-services industry.

GAZETTE: Some lawmakers have pointed to the GameStop stock trading frenzy in early 2021 as analogous to the crypto market, saying that most ordinary investors have gotten caught up in hype and don’t fully understand the risks they’re taking.

“I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.”

KOMINERS: First of all, it’s important to note that the GameStop run-up wasn’t in a new trading arena — it was Internet-hyped trading of a specific stock in the regular stock market. That said, the GameStop story is in some sense analogous to the meme trading of crypto products like Dogecoin — there’s consumer confusion around the idea that these assets could lose value. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the GameStop and Dogecoin run-ups and crashes. They were on a platform that made trading feel like a video game, and didn’t understand the real risks. And so in those ways, it’s analogous. Consumers and investors need to understand that these are high variance, speculative assets.

But when you get to the technology infrastructure pieces, GameStop and crypto can look very different. Cryptocurrency trading now looks a lot like equities trading — you have a brokerage account at an exchange, or potentially on a platform like Robinhood. But for many of the other crypto applications, the infrastructure is very, very new, and the platforms are very, very new, and they’re not heavily protected.

I think we’ll see more regulation around messaging and communication, but there are also more structural questions. For example, one of the regulatory conversations is around stablecoins — crypto assets that hold nominally fixed values because they’re designed to just be used for moving money from one place to another in a fixed denomination. They’re typically backed by reserves in a way similar to how banks back their loans with deposits. But there are questions about how to properly structure those reserves. If everyone simultaneously decided they wanted to divest, will stablecoins have the reserves to support that? I expect to see regulation around allowable assets and reserve design — just like we have with banks.

And finally, we’ll need regulation to ensure open competition among different crypto products and platforms.

GAZETTE: Besides fending off regulations, what are the industry’s other challenges?

KOMINERS: One basic challenge is around taxation of crypto income. This isn’t just about tax avoidance concerns — a lot of people would like to pay taxes on their crypto but have absolutely no idea how to do so. We don’t have clear crypto categories for taxation purposes, so it’s extremely complicated to figure out which parts are ordinary income versus capital gains, as well as when the associated income has accrued. Organizing the tax treatment of all these assets — and then, of course, ensuring tax payment — is essential.

Another challenge is environmental: A lot of the most popular crypto technologies at the moment require tremendous amounts of energy to run. And so, we’re going to start seeing government leadership and regulation driving a shift toward versions of this technology that are more environmentally sustainable.

Bitcoin and other early blockchains use a technology where you have to prove that you solved a very hard computational problem to record transactions securely. And solving those computational problems is taking up absurd amounts of energy. Newer blockchains use much less energy-intensive ways of validating transactions. And so, my guess and hope is that the way we’re going to get away from environmentally harmful cryptocurrency transactions is through continual improvements in the technology, alongside regulation and market forces pushing toward technologies that are much more efficient.

GAZETTE: If new regulations are on the way, what would be the best- or worst-case scenarios for the industry?

KOMINERS: I don’t think it’s a question of ‘no regulation’ versus ‘a lot.’ The real question is the extent to which regulators understand that crypto is a different type of product and tech infrastructure from anything they’ve regulated before. The worst case would be to just treat it like historical financial products or like historical tech platforms without thinking about the ways in which crypto differs, both in terms of its use cases and in terms of its underlying technology."
2021-09-18 23:00:13+00:00	Cryptocurrency: what is cryptocurrency, how it works, and why is crypto market down?	['The Staff Byline', 'Mostly Used For Collaborative Articles', 'Other Posts Covering Technology News', 'Features', 'Leaks', 'Informative Lists', 'Comparisons', 'How-Tos Etc.']	"Everyone wants a piece of the cryptocurrency market right now but what is it and how does it work?

Cryptocurrency is all the rage among people these days, especially the younger demographic. Everyone wants a piece of it, or at least dabble in the space to spur their curiosity. But, what is cryptocurrency? How does it work and how do you get to own it? These are some of the basics questions that we try to answer over here so that more people know more about it, and make a sound decision based on facts rather than any marketing gimmick. Here is everything from A to Z you need to know about cryptocurrency.

What is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of virtual currency that operates in a decentralised ecosystem — this means it is not part of any country’s legalised set-up and that no government has control over cryptocurrencies as these are issued by private companies. Being a virtual currency, crypto can be sent or received from any part of the world as geography is no longer a limitation for money to move across borders.

Currently, there is a wide range of crypto available in the market in which a person can invest. The most popular ones are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin Ripple, and NEO, among others. You can transfer cryptos between two accounts without needing a bank’s authorisation. This model has become appealing to many people these days, who are willing to give cryptos a shot, no matter what the results are.

How cryptocurrency works

As we mentioned, cryptocurrency operates in a decentralised system, which is called a blockchain. Basically, this technology runs through multiple computers that take care of the entire transaction in a ledger format. It is impossible to alter or delete these transactions, which makes it appealing for its secured nature. It also works through two-factor authentication, which is always the preferred choice of transacting virtually, no matter what system you are using.

So, let’s say you want to invest in Bitcoin or Ripple, you need to follow the basics of any financial transaction.

The person must open a crypto trading account

For that, all you have to do is apply for an account, submit Know Your Customer (KYC) documents that verify your identity and credentials

Once your application is approved, you can start trading in all kinds of cryptocurrencies

There are various crypto exchanges platforms like Coinbase, Binance, WazirX, Zebpay, and CoinDCX, among others that you have in India. Like the stock market, cryptos rely on market speculation, rumours, or a piece of booming news to push up the value of certain crypto, or bring it down. Most financial experts talk about its volatile nature, especially because of its infant stature in the ecosystem. So people are warned about its possible drawbacks before deciding to invest in Bitcoin, Ripple, or any other crypto.

Why is the crypto market down?

As we mentioned, the crypto market operates heavily on the basis of speculations. So any possible pro-crypto news can spike its value and even the slightest shadow of doubt over its performance can bring it down. Recently, crypto enthusiasts saw the dark side of investing in digital currencies. The crypto market has seen a decline due to the following reasons in the past:"
2021-09-08 02:31:04+00:00	Why Bitcoin, ether, other crypto prices are crashing	[]	"Bitcoin prices plummeted from more than $52,000 per coin, over 17% to $42,000, before recovering about half of that loss after El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday. However, the rollout stumbled in its first hours and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

Tuesday’s selloff is the most significant break in the rebound that had lifted Bitcoin almost 75% since late July. Overall cryptocurrency market value fell about $300 billion in the past 24 hours, according to tracker CoinGecko.

The world's largest cryptocurrency staged a small recovery as Bitcoin prices today were at around $46,757, down 11%. Meanwhile, other digital coins followed the lead with ether fell over 11% to $3,471 whereas dogecoin and cardano prices plunged 15% and 12% to $0.26 and $2.5 respectively. Stellar, XRP, Uniswap also crashed in the range of 15-20% over the last 24 hours.

“Social media platforms were very cautious over the weekend that a plunge could occur following El Salvador’s big day,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., wrote in a note, as reported by Bloomberg. Some investors likely bought in anticipation of the nation implementing its Bitcoin law Sept. 7 and then moved to “sell the fact,"" he said.

According to experts, bitcoin was still in the bull market as long the price stayed above the $43,000 level.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings and a long-time cryptocurrency bull, told Bloomberg the market for digital coins was running strong over the last eight weeks and became overbought. Interest from individual investors spiked on the back of large institutions jumping on board the crypto wagon, he said.

David Gerard, author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,"" told the Associated Press that Tuesday’s Bitcoin volatility likely had little to nothing to do with El Salvador. “My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

“Bitcoin basically doesn’t respond to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard said. “That sort of price pattern, where it crashes hugely in minutes then goes back up again, is usually one of the big guys burning the margin traders."" Because Bitcoin is so thinly traded, it could also have been a big holder making a large sale to have cash, thus sending the market for a ride, Gerard said.

2021-09-27 07:31:00+00:00	Bitcoin prices, crypto markets shrug off China’s latest bans on crypto	['Michelle Lim', 'Danny Park', 'Author Profile', 'Michelle Is A Journalist At Forkast. Prior To Joining The Team', 'She Wrote For Cnn', 'Served With The Singapore Foreign Service. She Holds A Master Of Journalism The University Of Hong Kong', 'A Bachelor Of Business Administration The National University Of Singapore.', 'Danny Is A Journalist At Forkast.News. Originally South Korea', 'Danny Has Produced Content For Media Companies In Korea', 'Hong Kong']	"Crypto markets were up Monday morning in Asia, a quick recovery following China’s announcements on Friday banning cryptocurrency trading and mining and yesterday’s news that Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global would cease account registration for new users in mainland China and close down the accounts for existing mainland Chinese users by Dec. 31.

Bitcoin – the largest cryptocurrency by market value — dropped to US$40,936 on Friday following China’s announcements but has since rebounded 7%, now trading above US$44,000, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum, too, dropped from US$3,100 to US$2,747 on Friday, but is currently trading back above US$3,100.

News of China’s latest bans was followed immediately by a dip in the total cryptocurrency market — from approximately US$1.99 trillion in market capitalization on Sept. 24 to US$1.86 on Sept. 26, according to CoinMarketCap. The number has since climbed back to US$1.96 trillion.

“It’s a bit like the story of the guy who cries wolf, you know, too many times and then people stop caring. And so I think that’s what we’re seeing with the markets right now,” Justin d’Anethan, head of exchange sales at crypto exchange EQONEX told Forkast.News.

Positive news over the weekend — coming on top of market-reassuring news earlier in the week that China’s Evergrande Group had stepped back from falling off a potential debt cliff — also warded off bearish sentiments, Justin d’Anethan said. For instance, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele on Sunday tweeted that 2.1 million Salvadorans were actively using the Bitcoin Chivo wallet.

“There’s a lot of fundamentals that are still very good,” d’Anethan added. “And then the China story is kind of heard that, before been there, done that.”

Although the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index currently stands at “Fear,” crypto market experts told Forkast.News that they remain long-term bullish on cryptocurrencies despite China’s latest ban — the most expansive and detailed yet for the world’s most populous nation — on cryptocurrency trading.

“For China specifically, there’s going to be a lot less transactions,” d’Anethan said. But, he added: “Enthusiasm for crypto globally is big enough and growing enough that it’s going to kind of balance that out.”

Tony Sycamore, City Index’s senior market analyst for APAC, told Forkast.News that “China’s role disrupting crypto markets has about run its course.”

“While the announcement provided a setback to our bullish view, it’s not a surprise. Providing Bitcoin holds above last week’s US$39,573 low, the technical outlook remains positive,” Sycamore said. “A break and close above last week’s US$45,159 high and above the 200-day moving average at US$45,575 would further indicate a retest and break of the US$52,956 high is underway.”

The technical outlook remains positive for Ethereum, provided it holds above last week’s US$2,650 low, Sycamore added. “A break and close above resistance coming from last week’s highs at US$3,175 would be a strong indication the correction from the US$4,025 high is complete and the uptrend has resumed.”

With China’s ban directly targeting the operations of Chinese cryptocurrency exchange heavyweights such as Huobi and OKEx, prices of their tokens have plunged. Prices of the Huobi token have dropped by more than 40% over the past seven days, according to Coinmarketcap. OKEX’s OKB is down over 20% in the same period.

Tether (USDT), a stablecoin that is frequently used to facilitate trading or used by traders as a hedge against volatility in cryptocurrency prices, also saw increased volumes. Trading volumes of USDT were up over 20% in the past 24-hours according to Coinmarketcap.

But decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, in particular those of decentralized exchanges — such as Uniswap and Sushi, which facilitate cryptocurrency transactions without an intermediary — have surged. Uniswap’s UNI and Sushiswap’s SUSHI are up over 30% and 20% respectively as of publishing time, according to Coinmarketcap.

“DeFi will surely benefit from the recent regulatory headwinds from both China and the U.S. with its decentralized nature,” Rachel Lin, co-founder of decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures, told Forkast.News. “We are seeing users migrating to DeFi even when some CeFi platforms are still accessible due to concerns of counterparty risk. As more retail traders move to DEXs, liquidity will continue to improve and professional investors will start building more positions, thus creating a positive feedback loop and driving greater adoption.”

Other crypto market watchers said the most recent price volatility provided some investors with the opportunity to build up their positions.

“We saw some aggressive dip buying flows on the desk from our institutional and high net worth clients, which shows long-term optimism,” Annabelle Huang, partner at Amber Group, told Forkast.News."
2021-09-13 14:08:16+00:00	Fake News of Walmart Adopting Litecoin Causes Crypto Markets to Pump and Dump Billions in Minutes	['Anthonia Isichei', 'More Posts This Author', 'About The Author', 'Anthonia Is A Fintech Writer Who Has Been Involved In The Crypto Space Since Covering Developments Across Regulations', 'Adoption', 'Several Other Aspects Of The Industry. When Not Neck-Deep In The Crypto News Cycle', 'Anthonia Spends Her Free Time Globetrotting', 'Playing Video Games.']	"The entire cryptocurrency market pumped when news that the US-based e-commerce giant Walmart, has inked a partnership deal with Litecoin to enable its customers to make payment with LTC broke out. Unfortunately, the news appeared to be fake, and the market dumped subsequently.

According to the fake press release on Monday (September 13, 2021), Walmart shoppers would have soon been able to start making payments with LTC across all eCommerce stores.

The story was quickly picked up by major news outlets, including Reuters and CNBC, which, ironically, had this in the body before editing it out:

“It was not immediately clear if the news release was actually authentic.”

Interestingly enough, the sites that picked up the story failed to notice that the impostor credited the press release to Walmart-corpCom, which isn’t related to Walmart Inc. in any way.

This triggered a marketwide reaction, and most cryptocurrencies pumped tremendously in a matter of minutes. Bitcoin touched $47K, and Litecoin – the hero in the fake story touched $240.

In aggregate, the entire market added a whopping $80 billion in a matter of minutes.

Moments later, though, speculations ran rampant that the story is fake,, and it didn’t take long for LTC to plunge.

The price plunged to $175, and it currently trades around that level. This had the entire market lose about $100 billion in the minutes after.

It didn’t take long for CNBC and other media outlets to confirm that the story was fake.

A Walmart spokesperson confirmed that the press release wasn’t authentic."
2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin sinks below $43,000 as Evergrande fears sweep markets	['Vildana Hajric', 'Eddie Van Der Walt']	"Bitcoin got caught up in broader market fears about possible contagion should Chinese property developer Evergrande see a messy debt default.

Cryptocurrency prices slumped as a broad selloff sparked by worries about contagion from China Evergrande Group swept through global markets.

Bitcoin was down 8.1% to trade around $43,743 as of 5:11 p.m. in New York. It had dropped as much as as 10.7% earlier, which pushed it below $43,000 and to its lowest level since the beginning of August. Ether briefly dropped below $3,000. Popular DeFi tokens some of the biggest declines: Cardano fell more than 10% over the last 24 hours, as did Dogecoin, while Polkadot lost roughly 16%, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

The losses mirrored the action in the broader market as investors weighed the risks coming from Evergrande’s debt woes and this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. The S&P 500 fell 1.7% in its worst session since May, while European equities tumbled the most in more than two months.

“Some have attributed the sudden dip to the currently ongoing Evergrande situation in China which has already caused turmoil in traditional markets,” wrote Jonas Luethy, a sales trader at GlobalBlock, the U.K.-based digital asset broker. “Analysts have suggested a choppy week is ahead, with a potential pullback to as low as $41,000.”

The swiftness of the plunge was likely accelerated as more than 272,000 traders had their accounts liquidated over the past 24 hours, equal to around $1.3 billion worth of crypto, according to data from Bybt, a crypto futures trading and information platform.

“This is part of a well-established pattern where it sells off as traders cash in their riskier assets to cover margin calls and/or sit on the sidelines until markets calm down and they feel more comfortable going back into riskier positions,” said Leah Wald, CEO at Valkyrie Investments.

Chartists say Bitcoin could test its 100-day moving average, which currently sits around $40,655. Should it fall to that level, it could find support at $40,000. Still, other signals show it could be in for a reprieve: the coin fell below the lower limit on the Trading Envelope indicator, suggesting it dropped too far, too fast. And its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 39 shows it’s creeping toward oversold levels.

Although Bitcoin doesn’t always trade in tandem with financial markets — a characteristic that made it a tempting proposition from a portfolio-diversification point of view — its correlation on a 30-day basis to futures on the Nasdaq 100 has been consistently positive since February last year. A reading of 0.5 — which it’s close to now — means they’re moving in the same direction quite often these days.

Investors say that while a link with tech stocks make sense — both types of investments may be thought of as appealing to the same tech-savvy investor pool — strong correlations are also showing up for small-cap stocks and the S&P 500. That’s probably because as Bitcoin becomes more integrated in global financial markets, it should respond more to the changes in risk appetite that drives global sentiment.

Meanwhile, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele said the country had “bought the dip,” in Bitcoin, adding 150 tokens to raise its total holdings to 700 — about $32 million based on current pricing. The nation recently adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in a controversial move that met with technical glitches and protests.

“Not everyone is selling,” said Valkyrie’s Wald.

We just bought the dip. 150 new coins! El Salvador now holds 700 coins.#Bitcoin🇸🇻 — Nayib Bukele 🇸🇻 (@nayibbukele) September 20, 2021

El Salvador’s enthusiastic adoption of Bitcoin is one of the reasons why prices have been trending higher and recently hit a four-month high. Still, the market has a way to go before recovering losses since a selloff in May.

“On a day like today, where you have the perfect storm, I think people just go to, ‘What can I sell quickest? What do I have access to at 2 in the morning?,’” said Scott Bauer, chief executive officer at Prosper Trading Academy. “If they’re holding crypto, which is obviously an around-the-clock market, maybe that’s the first place they look,” he said, adding that the news out of China is a negative for the crypto space."
2021-09-07 00:00:00+00:00	Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are Falling Today	['Bram Berkowitz']	"What happened

The price of most cryptocurrencies fell on Tuesday morning after some hit new highs on Monday night. The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) had dropped roughly 11% as of noon EDT, while the prices of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) had fallen roughly 12% and 18%, respectively.

The fall in prices seemed to be attributed to market volatility commonly associated with the cryptocurrencies, and as El Salvador looks to implement a law today that will see Bitcoin accepted as legal tender.

So what

Just before falling this morning, Bitcoin hit its highest price level since May at $52,000. Ethereum had traded close to $4,000 on Monday night, while Dogecoin at one point hit over $0.31 per token.

The price drops come on the day that the Latin American country El Salvador is set to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, making it the first country to do so. What this means is that citizens in the country can choose to use Bitcoin as payment and businesses must accept it in exchange for goods and services. In addition, citizens will be able to pay taxes in Bitcoin, Bitcoin exchanges will not be subject to capital gains taxes, and the price of Bitcoin will be tied to the dollar exchange rate.

In preparation for the new law, which is set to go in effect at 3 p.m. EDT today, the El Salvador government has purchased roughly $20 million in Bitcoin and installed 200 Bitcoin ATMs across the country. Government-run Bitcoin wallets will be loaded with $30 worth of Bitcoin for citizens who register. Reuters reported this morning that the El Salvador government ""had to unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand,"" as citizens register for the wallets.

Despite the issues, Leah Wald, CEO at the cryptocurrency and alternative asset management firm Valkryie Investments, said she was not surprised by the market's reaction today, as the news surrounding El Salvador has already been priced in.

""When this move was first announced, it didn't have nearly as big of an impact on price as some may have expected it might, possibly because El Salvador's population is less than New York City's, but also because the announcement was light on details and people were on the fence about how this was going to be implemented,"" Wald told CNBC. ""Transaction fees, processing times, and other hurdles also make this feel more like a beta test rather than a solution to many of the problems plaguing the country's poor.""

Wald added that if other Latin American countries begin accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, that could result in a ""parabolic"" move higher in crypto prices. Many experts believe Latin America could be ripe for adopting cryptocurrencies to help improve money transmission and for central banks that already deal with volatile currencies.

Now what

While the situation in El Salvador will be interesting to watch, I do not see anything that would change my view on certain cryptocurrencies.

I still feel quite bullish on Bitcoin and Ethereum. I am less bullish on Dogecoin, but can acknowledge that the cryptocurrency will likely move in tandem with the broader crypto market, and that it could move higher as stakeholders continue to update the network.

2021-09-07 19:55:00+00:00	Crypto Market Crashes, Bitcoin Falls to $42,800	[]	"A crash in the cryptocurrency market! Just yesterday we analyzed Bitcoin’s bullish breakout above the long-term $51,200 area, and today the largest cryptocurrency fell to a low of $42,800.

Other cryptocurrencies are losing even more. Most of them lost around 30% of their value today. The only altcoin from the TOP 10 that is not worried about the declines and continues to soar is Solana.

Bitcoin loses 19%

Bitcoin (BTC) fell 19% today from the peak at $53,000 to the low at $42,800. The price fell sharply between 15:00 and 17:00 CET, after BTC began to close consecutive hourly candles below the long-term $51,200 area. Moreover, this level coincides with the 0.618 Fib retracement of the entire downward movement in May.

The cascading drops ended in the area of long-term support of $42,800, which is the horizontal support level at the 0.382 Fib retracement (green rectangle). Thus, if this level is lost in the following days, the next support is in the area of $37,500, at the 0.236 Fib retracement level.

The sharp capitulation was followed by a significant upward rebound of 10%. Bitcoin quickly returned to the 0.5 Fib retracement area and is trading at $46,800 at the press time.

Sponsored Sponsored

The decline took place on relatively high volume, which could signal the beginning of a bearish impulse. If this happens, the drops could continue until the price validates again the $42,800 area as support.

The chance of this scenario is reinforced by the loss of important support at the 0.618 Fib retracement. Two days ago there was a false – as it turned out today – breakout when BTC clearly broke above the $51,200 level. Typically, this is a very bearish signal that strengthens the intensity of a downward movement.

Altcoins bleed harder

Almost all of the major altcoins saw drastic declines today, usually larger than Bitcoin. For example, counting through the entire length of the candle including wicks, Ethereum (ETH) lost 24% today and recorded a bottom at $3 009, Cardano (ADA) 30% with a bottom at $2, Chainlink (LINK) 33% and $23.79, and Dogecoin (DOGE) 31% and $0.21.

Sponsored Sponsored

Data from CoinGecko shows that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by more than 14% today. In the morning, the value of the market oscillated around $2.48 trillion, only to fall to the vicinity of $2.14 trillion for the time being.

The only top altcoin that seems unconcerned about the market tumble is Solana (SOL). Solana opened the day at $164, recorded a brief bottom at $128 to trade at $173 at the press time.

The coming hours and days will show the significance and consequences of today’s crash. It remains to be seen whether this is just a temporary correction and a bearish trap for too many long leveraged positions, or the beginning of a more significant change in trend."
2021-09-07 15:35:04+00:00	Bitcoin Crashes 10% in Hours as Crypto Market Sheds $300 Billion	['Decrypt', 'Andrew Hayward']	"In brief The cryptocurrency market is widely correcting today, with a nearly 10% drop in market cap over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin has shed all of its gains over the last week, while Ethereum and Solana are still in the green over the past seven days as of this writing.

Prices across the cryptocurrency market tumbled early Tuesday, with Bitcoin and the wider market seeing a nearly 10% drop over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The combined value of the crypto market has dropped from above $2.4 trillion to $2.1 trillion, with Bitcoin itself now falling below a $1 trillion market cap.

Today’s correction followed a full week of steady gains, with a 16% increase in overall market cap from August 30 to September 6. During that time, Ethereum (ETH) inched closer to its all-time high marker, Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the $50,000 mark again, and Solana (SOL) continually set new peak prices as its recent surge continued.

Solana is still up 38% on the week, as of this writing, while Ethereum is up about 2%. However, all of Bitcoin’s gains over the last week have been erased.

The sudden shift in market sentiment could be attributed, among other reasons, to a case of “buy the rumor, sell the news” related to El Salvador’s anticipated adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, which happened today. Bitcoin’s price continued to climb over the weekend in anticipation of the action, reaching levels not seen since May’s market-wide crash.

However, now that the day has come, Bitcoin is tanking—and taking most of the market with it. Bitcoin is now down 11% over the last 24 hours at a current price of $46,303.

Ethereum, meanwhile, has shed 16% of its value over the last 24 hours, dropping to a current price of $3,311. It was brushing up against the $4,000 level in recent days, including earlier this morning.

Cardano (ADA), the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is down 20% over the last 24 hours. That steeper decline has apparently been driven by questions regarding the platform’s ability to handle smart contracts, or the bits of code that perform set instructions and power decentralized apps such as peer-to-peer lending and trading services. ADA currently sits at a price of $2.27.

However, other coins in the top 10 have seen steeper declines over the last day. Binance Coin (BNB) is down 23% to $385, Dogecoin is down 23% to $0.24, and Polkadot is down 25% to just under $26.

It’s nearly all red in the market today, but it remains to be seen how long this correction will last—and how deep it will cut."
2021-09-04 09:24:51+00:00	Crypto market grows 47% in 30 days adding $0.7 trillion of inflows	['Jordan Major']	"After a turbulent couple of months, the cryptocurrency market has surged by 47% in the previous 30 days, adding $0.73 trillion in value.

Indeed, the crypto market value is now worth $2.28 trillion, up 2.27% in one day. Quantitatively, the crypto market volume has risen by 4.81% to $134.82 billion in the previous 24 hours. As a result of the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), the total volume in DeFi is presently $14.96 billion, or 11.1% of the entire 24-hour volume in the crypto market.

Moreover, analyzing the cryptocurrency market during the last month reveals the market was worth $1.55 trillion on August 4 and is now worth $2.28 trillion on September 4, representing a stunning $730 billion influx in only 30 days which is a 47% increase, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

With many trading experts considering that we are in the second leg of a bull run, crypto trader and analyst Michael van de Poppe has stated:

Ethereum driving the market

​​According to the Chainalysis CEO Michael Gronager, the driving force behind the rise in the market is Ethereum which has recently upgraded its network; in turn, he stated:

“We’ve seen the trend of DeFi that’s been growing and growing, and that’s been pumping the interest in Ethereum, and Ethereum is then dragging along a lot of the other cryptocurrencies with it.”

In agreement with Gronager is Michael van de Poppe; he feels Ethereum is the most dominant cryptocurrency on the market right now.

#Ethereum is the leader of the pack. When that one goes up, #Bitcoin, and the rest follows.



That's currently the case. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 3, 2021

Larger platform modifications to the Ethereum network stabilized and improved the network in different ways, therefore facilitating increased trust in Ethereum in general.

As of August 5th, the “London” hard fork of Ethereum (the technology behind the ether cryptocurrency) was updated. The upgrade to the digital ledger – and the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency – alters the computation of transaction fees for the better.

In order to reduce the quantity of ether in circulation and perhaps increase its price, each transaction fee is burnt or removed from circulation.

Currently, Ethereum is trading at $3,947, up 3.37% in the last 24 hours and up 21.79% in the last week.

Solana hits all-time high

A lot of money in the last 30 days has flocked into Solana (SOL) in the past year, interest in the term “Solana” has increased by 354.54%, according to Google Trends (YTD). The surge in searches coincides with the price of tokens, which reached an all-time high of $149 on September 4. Beyond Google Trends, our prior report indicated that the token’s popularity and volume were at an all-time high.

A number of causes are driving Solana’s value, with the move into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) emerging as the probable top driver. In the wake of the Degenerate Apes NFT collection release, interest in the asset has grown. For producers and token holders in the asset ecosystem, the publication became a focal point of interest.

A substantial number of well-performing projects are also being attracted to the network, which currently competes with Ethereum. In addition to supporting the NFT endeavor, the ecosystem also supports the expanding decentralized finance industry.

Investors may be searching for alternatives to Ethereum’s network, despite its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency. A notable example is that Ethereum is now undergoing improvements. Consequently, the network has recently experienced congestion and high transaction costs; as a result, investors and developers are looking for alternatives.

Currently, Solana is trading at $147.15, up 2.18% in the last 24 hours and up 67.93% in the last week.

Bitcoin breaks past $50,000

Finally, the flagship digital asset has once again achieved $50,000 as it looks to set all-time highs. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is changing hands at $50,121, up 1.54% on the day and 2.21% in the last week.

For many crypto trading experts, $51,000 is now the level to break above for further bullish momentum crypto trader Josh Rager considers that there is not much resistance up to the mid $50,000s.

Nice break to the upside here

In fact, Bitcoin began a bull run earlier this year, but it reversed in May due to increasing crackdowns from countries such as China.

However, there has been an uptick in interest since Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced at the B-Word conference that Tesla would likely accept Bitcoin payments again in the future. A few months ago, Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin due to concerns about its environmental impact.

Since the B-Word conference, Bitcoin has been on an upward trend, with many trading experts predicting that it could exceed $100,000 before the conclusion of the bull run as more institutions and nations accept the digital asset."
2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00	Why Cryptocurrencies Dropped Like a Rock Today	['Travis Hoium']	"What happened

Cryptocurrencies had a very rough start to the week on Monday, some dropping 10% or more. There's generally a ""risk-off"" trade taking place where investors sell risky assets to acquire more stable assets, and that tends to disproportionately hurt cryptocurrencies. There's also some fear that the financial markets are facing a looming crisis, and if that craters asset values, including in crypto, traders could panic-sell or be forced to sell because of margin calls, causing a cascading market impact if.

As of 10:30 a.m. EDT, Bitcoin (BTC 1.66%) has fallen 7.6% over the last 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH 1.91%) is down 8.9%, Solana (SOL -3.04%) has dropped 10.5%, and Cardano (ADA 1.76%) is down 8.6%. Smaller crypto assets have fallen even further, so the drop is widespread in the crypto industry.

So what

The stock market overall is down sharply on Monday morning as investors weigh the risk facing asset values. A company called China Evergrande Group, a real estate developer, is expected to miss interest payments on debt this week, and with $300 billion in liabilities for the company, there could be a cascading impact on financial markets.

A default by a large company like Evergrande could cause investors to pull back on investing in either debt or equity in Chinese real estate, which could have an impact on debt and equity markets in the U.S. In a worst-case scenario, something like the ""Lehman moment"" happens: The collapse of one company causes a domino effect across financial markets, affecting both the values and the liquidity (or the availability to sell quickly) of financial assets. Comparisons like this may be speculation at this point, but investors are certainly uneasy that valuations have risen too high too fast and some kind of event will cause a collapse in markets sometime soon, so big reactions to news like Evergrande's isn't surprising.

On a more crypto-focused note, The New York Times reported this weekend that the Financial Stability Oversight Council could deem stablecoins (which are tied to a real currency like the U.S. dollar) systemically risky. This would subject them to regulation, which could dramatically affect the market for stablecoins.

Now what

The reality for cryptocurrencies is that today they're trading assets for investors, rather than a utility product. And that means that when markets go down we will likely see cryptocurrency prices go down as well. That's exactly what we're seeing today.

What we don't know is whether there will be any kind of recovery in crypto prices. If there is indeed some kind of financial crisis on the horizon, I worry that stable assets like the U.S. dollar will be the safe haven, not cryptocurrencies that still don't have much utility.

We also don't know how the crypto market will react in a time of crisis. Will investors panic-sell, causing margin calls for some and continued selling? Given the volatility in crypto prices over the last year, I think we'll see wild swings in prices if financial markets are threatened. If that's true, this may not be the last big decline for cryptocurrencies this year."

Dominating industry headlines yesterday and today is the publication of fake news from a series of mainstream media and cryptocurrency-focused news outlets. The news — which was published by CoinDesk, Decrypt, Blockworks, CNBC, Reuters, Zerohedge and Bloomberg — claimed that retail giant Walmart had partnered with Litecoin after a now-deleted fake press release was published by GlobeNewswire.

Following the publication of the fake news, the price of LTC surged from roughly $175 to upward of $230 across global cryptocurrency exchanges before almost entirely retracing.

NFT Snapshot: Fragments of an Infinite Field latest AB hit

The nonfungible token space was smitten yesterday with the latest Art Blocks Curated release, “Fragments of an Infinite Field” by artist Monica Rizzolli. The Dutch auction made 1,623 ETH — around $5.38 million at the time of the sale — in less than an hour.

Though Art Blocks Curated releases are almost universally popular, Rizzolli’s has garnered significant buzz — with many in the NFT space praising the artistic merits of the generative works.

BTC technical analysis: Trying to recover

The price of BTC is attempting a recovery but may run into trouble at the bottom of a wide resistance zone and the top of the four-hour ribbon of exponential moving averages. Reentry into the wide resistance zone would be welcomed by those bullish on the foremost cryptocurrency, while failure to do so could spark a new wave of sellers.

ETH technical analysis: Putting in lower highs

The price of ETH continues to put in lower highs against BTC, suggesting that further declines may be in store for the trading pair. Adding pressure is the four-hour EMA ribbon, which is currently above ETHBTC and adds further bearish bias on lower time frames.

Bitcoin fell four per cent in less than half an hour this afternoon, as risk assets around the world drop on fears over fallout from the looming default of Chinese property developer Evergrande.

BTC fell from US$47,200 to as low as US$45,200 from 12.26pm AEST to 13.05pm, mirroring a plunge in Australian and Asian equities and US futures.

At 4.16pm AEDT, Bitcoin was trading at US$45,773, down 4.7 per cent from 24 hours ago.

“This is a risk-off move,” City Index analyst Tony Sycamore told Ausbiz TV this afternoon. “We’ve got the third leg of a correction playing out currently.”

Looking at it through an Elliot Wave framework, Sycamore predicted that BTC could drop as low as US$40,000, “give or take one thousand”, before heading higher.

“I still like Bitcoin in the bigger picture, so this for me would be a corrective pullback within an uptrend,” he said.

It’s a “phenomenal” buying opportunity for bulls, Sycamore said, although adding that people who are already long crypto might not be as happy. He was predicting another four or five per cent drop.

Perth-based ThinkMarkets analyst Carl Capolingua tweeted that uncertainty over Evergrande and losses from Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were leaking into crypto markets.

He also saw BTC’s long-term uptrend intact, but the short-term momentum has been lost, he wrote. He recommended staying out of the market until BTC had climbed to US$48,818 or dropped to US$42,582.

But Bitcoin chartist Mick Krypto saw some reason for optimism.

El Salvador buys the dip, gives trading advice

El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele tweeted at 2.53pm AEST that El Salvador had bought another 150 BTC – roughly US$6.9 million worth.

Truly incredible. Like a 4chan joke, but from a sitting president. — Craig Johnson (@HistOfTheRight) September 20, 2021

97 of top 100 coins down

Overall the crypto market was down 5.7 per cent to US$2.1 trillion, with Ethereum dropping 6.8 per cent to a nine-day low of US$3,191.

Seventeen of the top 100 coins were down by double-digits, while just three had gained ground.

The biggest loser was Algorand, the No. 19 coin, which was down 14.6 per cent to US$1.81.

THORChain, Hedera Hashgraph, Icon and Waves were close behind, all falling 12 to 14 per cent.

On the flip side, Cosmos (ATOM) was the biggest gainer, rising 5.5 per cent to US$41.32.

Osmosis, a decentralised exchange built on Cosmos that’s a recent addition to the top 100, gained 4.3 per cent to US$7.16.

Both coins had hit all-time highs a little after lunchtime (Sydney time), at US$44.42 and US$7.61, respectively.

Currently the No. 16 coin on Coingecko, Cosmos is an interconnected “internet of blockchains” – an ecosystem of sovereign blockchain apps connected by the Cosmos Hub.

Compound Dai had also edged slightly higher.

2021-09-08 11:32:53+00:00	Blockster, the Future of Social Networking in the Crypto Market	[]	"As, back in 2017, Facebook and Google – the world’s biggest advertising platforms – announced a blanket ban on crypto advertising, major crypto companies were left with little to no ways of reaching their target audience. In order to connect with their communities, these companies took to Medium, Twitter, and Reddit. Even though most of them still rely on these platforms, the data there is scattered, which makes it challenging to efficiently navigate it.

From the crypto enthusiasts’ point of view, up until recently, there’s been a lack of a single, reliable source of information. One had to rely on platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to track the performance of their favorite projects, go to Reddit to discuss them, get the latest industry updates on Medium and Twitter, or watch influencers reviews on YouTube. So we were left with a disintegrated social landscape for an emerging market, which made it difficult for traders and creators to communicate, assess the information, or monetize their content – and this is exactly where Blockster comes in to fill the gap.

A Thriving Community For the Rising Market

According to the project’s whitepaper, the word ‘blockster’ stands for a crypto-centric or a business using the Blockster platform to connect, create, earn and learn. It perfectly sums up the platform’s mission: to connect all the blocksters of the world: crypto enthusiasts, content creators, entrepreneurs, and investors, so they can get the latest industry news, share their ideas and content, collaborate, keep a track of all their crypto investments in a single techy and trendy space.

Blockster is a multi-purpose platform built to connect and empower the ever-growing crypto industry. It has its own social network, discussion groups, industry-grade crypto tracking sub-platform and many more features to be added soon. At the time of this writing, the platform already has a waitlist of over 414,000 eager users and over 150 partners, including such prominent projects as Chainlink, Enjin, Zilliqa, and NEWSBTC.

With new partners joining literally every day, Blockster plans to incorporate all major crypto projects in the upcoming months. As this happens, it will imminently become a one-stop-shop for all things crypto; the go-to platform for anyone who wants to learn, invest or earn money within the space.

Embracing the Latest Trends

Sharing the same vibe with the young and fluid crypto space, Blockster is evolving together with it, as it keeps adding new features which are most in-demand across the community. In Q4 2021, it plans to roll out a digital wallet, a mobile app, and release a self-serve advertising system.

BXR, At The Heart of the Ecosystem

The vibrant Blockster ecosystem is powered by the BXR token that is uniquely positioned to increase in value with time. As the Blockster community grows, it is bound to become a stable cryptocurrency backed by millions of loyal users.

BXR will be the only currency used to pay for advertising on Blockster. The platform plans to start testing the advertisement platform at the end of this year and accept payment for ads starting Q1 2022. By the end of the first quarter, Blockster expects to have over 450 partners placing their ads on the platform.

Through ads, the platform will offer an excellent growth point for businesses, providing them with a space to get more exposure and connect directly with their target audience. Blockster in turn will redistribute 20% of all of its ad revenue to its community of stakers. Every month, 5% of BXR collected as ad revenue also is burned, ensuring the appreciation of its value.

Blockster is the networking platform for cryptocurrency professionals, investors, traders and enthusiasts. Essentially, it is a marketing tool for crypto-centric businesses and individuals. Not only does the platform allow users to network and market themselves within the platform, but it also provides the latest industry news, coin tracking for the entire cryptocurrency market, as well as, a real-time messaging application for P2P and group chatting.

Blockster Holdings is a parent company of Blockster. The initial seed investors, based in the UK and UAE, invested $1.9 million in 2020, valuing the company at $25 million."
2021-09-22 03:52:22+00:00	Why September is seen as a bad month for cryptocurrencies	[]	"Cryptocurrencies are experiencing their second sell-off in September. With China’s Evergrande crisis sparking fears of a massive global asset sell-off, Bitcoin saw a 24-hour low of $40,267 before regaining slightly to close out at slightly over $43,000 for 1 BTC. But Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency to see a dip for the second time in the month. Ether, XRP and Cardano are all down over both a week-long period and over the month.

This is not the first time that cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, have been in the red in the month of September. The September bearish market for crypto has been observed over the past four years.

Also read:

Something about September?

However, the phenomenon is not isolated to cryptocurrency assets. The stock market has historically performed the worst in the month of September. The US stock market indices, which track the performance of the stock market by tracking the price of share prices of some of the biggest companies in the US, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500, and the NASDAQ, have performed the worst in the month of September. The effect is well-recorded enough where it has been termed the September Effect.

While many have theorised about what causes the September Effect, there is no consensus on what causes the effect. It has been observed that the effect has been dissipating over the past few years, and in some years stock markets have managed to even grow during September contrary to beliefs of a constant bear market.

Most believe that the September Effect is a prime example of market psychology, where enough investors believe in the idea of the bear market in the month and thus sell off their stocks. This sell-off results in a dip in prices which further reinforces the idea of the September effect.

The Bitcoin case

Similarly, in the case of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, there is no particular reason as to why September has been a ‘bad’ month. For September 2021 in particular, the cryptocurrency market has been in a volatile state since the start of the year, and even slight changes in global situations have produced significant effects on crypto prices.

In September, the potential fallout of Evergrande in China, the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador and South Korea’s shuttering of crypto exchanges have had major effects on the price of the prime cryptocurrency. These effects have had a more tangible influence on Bitcoin prices than the mythical September Effect.

While many investors and crypto enthusiasts swear by the effect, the likely explanation from the previous five years of poor performance in the month is just a random chance that many individuals try to fit into a false pattern."
2021-09-22 15:45:00+00:00	The Crypto Market is Down — Why Are Prices Falling?	[]	"Denis Goncharenko

Bitcoin price had fallen as high as 10.7 percent earlier this week, pushing it to below $43,000, and then to its lowest point since August's beginning. Ether was briefly below $3,000. The most well-known DeFi tokens have seen some of the most notable decreases: Cardano fell more than 10% in the last 24 hours, and so did Dogecoin and Polkadot dropped around 16%, as per CoinMarketCap.com.

The losses were mirrored by the volatility on the global market as investors assessed the potential risks posed by Evergrande's debt problems and next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7 percent during its most tense session since May, and European equity markets fell the most in the past two months.

Some have attributed the recent decline to the ongoing Evergrande crisis in China that has already caused chaos in the market sectors that are accustomed to it. Analysts have indicated that a turbulent week ahead, including an eventual pullback that could be the low of $41,000.

The rapidity of the crash was likely to be accelerated by the fact that nearly 272,000 investors saw their accounts wiped out in the last 24 hours, which is about $1.3 billion in crypto, as per data from Bybt the crypto futures exchange and platform for information.

The occurrence has hit brokerage companies, as well, many of which had to provide a comprehensive explanation to their clients of what happened and why it has happened. Almost all of the service providers listed on BitcoinCapital have seen active trading of the most popular cryptos during the past few hours. Even though the picture seems worrying, experts still hold hopes.

Analysts from Chartists believe Bitcoin could be able to test its 100-day moving mean, which is currently around $40,655. If it falls to that point the coin could find support at $40,000. But other signals suggest that it's likely to get an opportunity to rebound: the currency dropped below the lower limit of the Trading Envelope indicator, suggesting that it fell too much, too quickly. The one-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 39 indicates that it is moving towards oversold levels.

Investors think that although the connection between tech stocks and Bitcoin is logical because both kinds of investments are considered attractive to the same investor group that is tech-savvy, strong correlations are also being observed for small-cap stocks as well as those in the S&P 500. It's likely because Bitcoin is more integrated into the global financial market and is more able to respond to changes in risk appetite which determines the global mood.

The president of El Salvador Nayib Bukele claimed that the nation has ""bought the dip"" with Bitcoin by adding 150 tokens, which brought its total assets to 700, which is around $32 million, based on the current price. El Salvador is currently implementing Bitcoin as a legal tender, a move that was met with technical issues and protests.

""Not all investors are selling,"" said Valkyrie's Wald.

El Salvador's enthusiastic embrace of Bitcoin is among the main reasons that prices have been rising and recently hit the four-month mark. But, the market has a long way to go before it can recover losses after the selloff that occurred in May."

BITCOIN OVERVIEW

BTC ended the month of July with a distinct spike in price that many bulls were hoping for after two months of sideways market. This 8-consecutive-days price surge marked the general uptrend for the month of August, some minor corrections of up to 10% happening along the way. End of month BTC is coming close to support levels at USD $47.5K after having tested the psychological resistance level of US $50K on Aug 23rd, a price level which had not been seen since mid-May.

Testing the uptrend’s support levels represents profit taking happening in the market after a 70% surge since July 20th.

During the August uptrend BTC Open Interest grew at a faster pace than the price of the underlying. This signifies opening of new OI positions on the long end given that the funding rate is in the positive territory. At the same time, looking at relatively low and stable funding rate environment and futures spot basis, it seems the market does not yet have the strength to bounce back to meet the resistance levels at $56K. The current return to sideways drift might lead to a further consolidation period extending into the beginning of September.

Macroeconomic uncertainty with growing tapering concern had an impact on the cryptocurrency markets and will likely extend into the next month ahead of the Fed’s meeting on September 21/22.

ETHEREUM OVERVIEW

London fork finally introduced the long-awaited EIP-1559 upgrade to Ethereum on August 5. EIP-1559 will ensure that a portion of Ethereum’s gas fees will be burnt, with the rest going to miners, thus creating a case for the asset’s scarcity. Given the growing institutional and retail adoption of Ethereum, London upgrade was an important milestone to ensure the cryptocurrency’s future success. This upgrade was priced in in the ETH upwards trend lasting from July 21st through to mid-August.

The price had a steady run breaking 100d MA at $2,550 to shot upwards and peak at $3,378 on August 23rd. In one month between July 20 and August 23 ETH appreciated by more than 96% rallying all the way from $1,720 up to $3,378. ETH is currently in a consolidation period following the overall crypto market, gathering foundation for its next move.

EIP-1559 Detailed

London upgrade finally introduced the long-awaited EIP-1559 upgrade to Ethereum. EIP-1559 will ensure that a portion of Ethereum’s gas fees will be burnt, with the rest going to miners. This upgrade was priced in in the upwards trend lasting from July 21 through to mid-August.

Which impact will EIP-1559 have on the Ethereum network for users?

1. It promises to provide a predictable fee-payment experience creating less cases of massive fee overpayment on the network.

2. The new base-fee burning mechanism will enforce the reduction in ETH issuance decreasing the crypto’s inflation rate.

Ethereum’s fee market today is based on first price auction where fees can fluctuate drastically depending on competing transactions pricing. To solve these issues, EIP-1559 introduces a predictable base-fee mechanism. Coindesk Research report explains this upgrade as follows:

“The base fee is the minimum gas price required for users to send a transaction or complete an operation on Ethereum under EIP 1559. It fluctuates in accordance to how much space is being utilized per block on Ethereum. Ideally, each block on Ethereum would contain a maximum of 15 million gas. However, in times of network congestion, EIP 1559 would allow block sizes to increase up to twice this amount.

These adjustments over the long term are designed to ensure gas usage on Ethereum trends towards an average of roughly 15 million gas per block.”

Since the implementation of the London Hard Fork, Ethereum network has already burned over 150 thousand ETH worth around US $500 million.

THE CASE FOR CARDANO

In the month of August, ADA increased in price by over 110%, rallying from around $1.3 in the beginning of the month to $2.8 by the month’s end. In dollar terms, Cardano has seen the strongest growth in the crypto space, gaining more than US $45 billion in market cap over the course of one month.

So what is Cardano and why is it so special? Launched in 2017, Cardano is the second largest blockchain supporting Smart Contracts functionality, providing a platform for crypto projects and decentralized applications. At the moment of writing, Smart Contracts have not been deployed on Cardano’s blockchain yet, however seem to be imminent according to the developers’ updates. The time schedule is September following the completion of Alonzo hard fork. (Read More)

Source: youtube.com | IOHK

With the launch of Smart Contracts, Cardano expects to become superior to Ethereum: while the latter is only transitioning to the Proof of Stake protocol, Cardano is already successfully running it. In fact, Cardano is currently the world’s largest proof of stake blockchain by market cap.

One of Cardano’s most obvious advantages is the project’s high degree of decentralization. Cardano’s 3,000 stake pool operators are responsible for 100% of block production. The higher the number of block producers on the network, the higher degree of security they provide making the 51% attack highly unlikely.

The distribution of ADA in circulation is yet another evidence of the project’s preference for decentralization, with only 16% of crypto assets belonging to the team & founders and 84% sitting in the hands of investors.

In the month of August, ADA appreciated by over 110%, rallying from around $1.3 in the beginning of the month to $2.8 by the month’s end.

SOLANA’S RALLY

Solana is the next competitor for dominance in the Smart Contracts space, growing SOL at mind-blowing 224% in the month of August. This price increase added roughly US $24 billion in the crypto’s market capitalization.

Solana is also a relatively new web-scale blockchain designed to provide fast, secure and scalable apps and marketplaces. The focus is the transaction speed, which Solana solves with the Proof of History mechanism. It assigns a time-stamp for each transaction to achieve scalability and high throughput.

Solana is ahead of its closest competitors like Polkadot or Cardano, since the project had already deployed the Smart Contracts functionality and has multiple projects running live on its network. We have seen the benefits of having leading projects in its ecosystem during the August SOL rally following the news of Degenerate Apes — Solana’s NFT project — going viral (Read More), and Audius partnering with TikTok (Read More).

Volatility and Correlations

GOVERNMENTS & REGULATION: US

August has been rich with the US regulators tacking the safety and control in the crypto markets.

On August 3rd SEC chairman Gary Gensler spoke openly about cryptocurrency regulation at the Aspen Security Forum. Gensler highlighted the SEC’s authority in overseeing the crypto market and the need for further rules with regards to crypto exchanges, lending platforms, DeFi and stablecoins. A hot topic for the upcoming future is determining whether a crypto asset is a security and thus must be registered with SEC. (Read More)

A bright note of Gensler’s crypto discussion was his hint to review bitcoin ETF proposals to include bitcoin futures traded on CME. And while hopes for an SEC-regulated bitcoin ETF remain a dream, a bitcoin futures ETF is close to becoming a reality. After this announcement, asset managers rushed to rewrite and file proposals for bitcoin Futures ETFs, including Valkyrie, VanEck, Galaxy Digital, Invesco, ProShares and other. (Read More)

Infrastructure Bill

In the beginning of the month, market’s concern was around the Senate’s Infrastructure Bill narrowing a cryptocurrency tax reporting provision that would raise $28 billion over 10 years.

The Bill has a rather broad and unclear definition of a ‘broker’: it could encompass any entity facilitating crypto transactions (including miners, hardware and software developers) and would make financial reporting and disclosures mandatory for these ‘crypto brokers’. Two amendments were proposed to narrow the scope of provision exempting miners, validators and entities that do not provide custody and trading services. Interesting point is that one of these amendments tried to exempt only proof-of-work validators, which could be interpreted as implicit backing of Bitcoin as opposed to Ethereum. (Read More)

In the end the Senate failed to amend crypto wording in the Bill leaving the new cryptocurrency tax requirements quite controversial. As usual in a bull market, the news was taken with a positive attitude of ‘we lost the battle but not the war’. Market participants claim that Washington expanding tax regulation to crypto is a sign of long-term regulatory acceptance and even support. (Read More)

Seasoned traders are sure that BTC and other cryptos will still win.

Many crypto believers share their thoughts via Twitter.

As the crypto market has gone bearish on us today, basic traders and investors are once again — to no one’s surprise, showing skepticism. Every time the market shows the slightest dip, the community panics in fear of their investments falling.

Of course, the viewpoint is totally different when it comes to seasoned traders, long-time hodlers, and firm crypto believers. A Twitter post from the reputed crypto investor — Lark Davis, leads to an interesting thread.

Fed news, China fears, and upcoming infrastructure bill are all weighing heavy on the market. #crypto #bitcoin — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) September 20, 2021

From this, we can see that most seasoned traders are wary of the current trials the crypto market is facing. Still, they are sure of the power and capabilities of cryptos.

In particular, Lark Davis highlights some issues that plague the crypto industry. For instance, he talks about the upcoming infrastructure bill, China’s continued efforts to hinder crypto adoption, and other government efforts to limit crypto activities.

Many replies to the tweet speculate the cause for another dip. Some say this is because investors are dumping cryptos to take profits. However, this cannot be the case for many big cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC). Most Bitcoin holders have been and will continue to hold their assets.

Meanwhile, other related tweets include a steady and strong drive by other believers who continue to invest and hold crypto assets. For one, Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador tweets that they bought 150 more BTC. Now, the country holds 700 Bitcoins.

This is a testament to the president’s faith in Bitcoin. He continues to buy BTC even after citizens marched out to protest its adoption as a legal tender. Bukele says Bitcoin will make remittance payments faster and cheaper, others say it will power corruption.

Another interesting tweet states that banks have been powering corruption for years but no one seems to care about that. Lark Davis chimes in again saying, “the government is obsessed with keeping people poor”.

Finally, Michael Saylor — CEO of MicroStrategy, tweets saying Bitcoin will win. In fact, he says that all forms of technology will be the ones that will come out on top. Specifically, he says the only losers will be antiquated technology and fiat credit. Lastly, he tweets that the most certain time for Bitcoin is when tomorrow is uncertain.

2021-09-20 00:00:00+00:00		['Eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht Finma']	"The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA has approved the first crypto fund according to Swiss law. The fund, which is restricted to qualified investors, invests primarily in so-called cryptoassets.

For the first time, FINMA has approved a Swiss fund that invests primarily in cryptoassets, that is to say in assets based on the blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The fund concerned goes by the name of the “Crypto Market Index Fund”, an investment fund according to Swiss law belonging to the category ""other funds for alternative investments"" with particular risks. Distribution of this fund is restricted to qualified investors.

Consideration of the particular risks

In order to facilitate serious innovation, FINMA applies the existing provisions of financial market laws in a consistently technology-neutral way, i.e. in keeping with the “same risks, same rules” principle. In doing so, it makes sure that new technologies are not being used to circumvent the existing rules and that the protective goals of financial market legislation are preserved. Since cryptoassets involve particular risks, FINMA also tied the approval to specific requirements in the present case. For instance, the fund may only invest in established cryptoassets with a sufficiently large trading volume. Furthermore, the investments must be made through established counterparties and platforms that are based in a member country of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and are subject to corresponding anti-money laundering regulations. Finally, there are specific requirements with regard to risk management and reporting for the institutions involved in the management and custody.

Europe has become the world’s largest crypto market for the first time (Photo illustration by Edward Smith/Getty Images)

EUROPE has been crowned the world’s largest crypto market with investment in decentralised finance (DeFi) driving a surge in transaction volumes.

European countries received more than $1tn (£734.4bn) worth of cryptocurrency in the space of a year, which represents 25 per cent of global activity, according to a new study by Chainalysis.

The UK was the leading European country for crypto activity between June 2020 and July 2021, with $170bn worth of digital assets received.

Kim Grauer, the Director of Research at Chainalysis dubbed the UK an emerging “global professional cryptocurrency hub”.

“The region in general – Central, Northern, & Western Europe – has the biggest cryptocurrency economy of any region that we study, surpassing East Asia following China’s regulatory crackdowns earlier this year,” Grauer said.

Surging crypto trade volumes are being driven by interest in DeFi, crypto projects and applications which offer decentralised versions of the financial services traditionally offered by banks.

Share of crypto market transaction volume by region (credit: Chainalysis)

Analysis of 34 European countries showed that, in each of the nations, investment in Ether and wrapped Ether – tokens used to access a vast ecosystem of DeFi projects – attracted more capital than any other market segment.

DeFi accounted for the majority of capital invested by large institutional, retail and professional investors across the continent. Gauer confirmed that the UK’s breakaway crypto transaction volumes were “in large part driven by DeFi activity among large, institutional traders”.

In the UK, the flagship cryptocurrency – Bitcoin – accounted for 28 per cent of crypto transactions while the challenger currency Ethereum made up around 40 per cent. DeFi projects accounted for the majority of UK crypto activity with 49 per cent of revenues arising from DeFi protocols.

The comments chime with data showing that DeFi adoption is highest amongst institutional investors and professional traders who have the funds to experiment with riskier projects.

The Chainalysis report found that large institutional cryptocurrency transaction value helped to drive the growth of the European market, jumping from $1.4bn in July 2020 to $46.3bn in June 2021 as banks and financial institutions increased their crypto exposure.

It comes as data released yesterday revealed that more than six in ten institutional investors and wealth managers from the US, UK, France, Germany, and the UAE currently don’t have any exposure to cryptocurrencies and digital assets, and expect to invest for the first time within the next year.

2021-09-27 00:00:00+00:00	Global Cryptocurrency Market (2021 to 2026) - Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecasts	['Research']	"Dublin, Sept. 27, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Cryptocurrency Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2021-2026"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



The global cryptocurrency market reached a value of US$ 364.5 Billion in 2020. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 60.8% during 2021-2026. Keeping in mind the uncertainties of COVID-19, the analyst is continuously tracking and evaluating the direct as well as the indirect influence of the pandemic. These insights are included in the report as a major market contributor.



Cryptocurrency refers to digital or virtual money secured by cryptography to monitor transactions and prevent counterfeit. It does not have a physical representation and is distributed over a vast network of computers connected to a virtual environment. It operates through decentralized networks that are based on the blockchain technology. The transfers are secured through public or private keys and are connected directly to the user's digital wallet. In contrast to the traditionally used currency, it is not issued by a centralized authority and has minimal interference or manipulation from the government. It also offers various advantages, such as enhanced portability, divisibility, inflation resistance and transparency.



Increasing digitization across industries represents one of the key factors driving the growth of the market. In line with this, easy accessibility to and rising penetration of high-speed internet connectivity in daily activities is also creating a positive outlook for the market. Furthermore, legalization and approval of purchase, sale or trade of virtual currencies in various developed countries are also driving the market growth. With the immense transparency of distributed ledger technology or blockchain, there is minimal risk of fraudulent or unwanted transactions due to human or machine error or data manipulation. This enables all the parties to monitor any changes that are being made during the transaction in real-time, thereby offering enhanced data security and immutability of the transactions. Additionally, convenient access to online trading platforms that can be used through smartphones is contributing to the market growth. Other factors, including growing market capitalization or market cap of the industry, along with the advent of bitcoin cash and bitcoin lite, are anticipated to drive the market further.

Bitcoin has suffered a massive price crash amid difficulties with El Salvador’s rollout of a new law making the cryptocurrency legal tender.

The price fell from above $52,500 to below $44,000 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.

It has since recovered slightly and is trading back above $46,000, at the time of writing.

Several other leading cryptocurrencies also suffered heavy losses, including ethereum (ether), cardano (ada) and binance coin.

“Horrible chart damage being done in BTC and the rest of the crypto market, tweeted crypto analyst and author Glen Goodman.

“Bitcoin just bounced cleanly off the previous resistance line. Is this a retest of that line or the start of something much worse?”

(CoinMarketCap)

The price correction has wiped hundreds of billions from the overall market, which was worth more than $2.35 trillion at the start of the day.

Leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase experienced issues as people rushed to their portfolios to either cash out or buy the dip.

The company said it was “aware transactions are currently delayed or cancelled at elevated rates and our apps may be experiencing errors”."
2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00	Stocks and futures rebound, crypto flat as the markets head for a down week	[]	"This is the web version of Bull Sheet, a no-nonsense daily newsletter on what’s happening in the markets. Sign up to get it delivered free to your inbox.

Happy Friday, everyone.

Taper with no tantrum. That’s what we’re getting a glimpse of this morning after the European Central Bank yesterday beat the Fed in the race to cut back on stimulus spending, and—what’s this?—stocks are jumping.

To be fair, you’d need to get out the really strong bifocals to spot where exactly the Europeans are cutting back on asset purchases. And, Christine Lagarde herself told the markets, “The lady’s not tapering.” There’s a Maragaret Thatcher reference somewhere in that comment. Perhaps fans of “The Crown” spotted it before I did.

To recap: Asian and European stocks are gaining this morning, as are U.S. futures. Crypto is flat.

Let’s see what else is moving markets as we close out the trading week.

Markets update

Asia

Asia is bouncing back, with the Hang Seng up 1.6% in afternoon trading as tech stocks gain.

even after the automaker cut global production output as COVID infection numbers hit suppliers in Southeast Asia. Global crude prices have been choppy in the past 24 hours after China, in an unprecedented move, released oil onto the markets from its strategic reserve as domestic energy costs surge.

Europe

The European bourses were mostly higher in early trading with the Stoxx Europe 600 up nearly 0.3% at the open. Consumer goods and tech stocks lead the way higher.

were mostly higher in early trading with the up nearly at the open. Consumer goods and tech stocks lead the way higher. On Thursday, European stocks rebounded after the ECB said it would—surprise!—begin to slow down its bond-buying spree by year-end, but only by a smidge. Sovereign bond yields and bank stocks jumped on the news. But don’t celebrate, bond fans. Inflation is expected to rise in the near-term.

U.S.

U.S. futures are bouncing back this morning. Even still, it’s a near certainty the three major averages will finish the week in the red.

data failed to trigger a stocks rally. Only financials, energy and materials managed to finish yesterday in the green. Airlines, including Southwest, United and Delta, warned investors the outlook for air travel looks bleak with Delta—the COVID variant, that is—still surging. And yet, investors sent shares in all three higher yesterday—but it appeared to be a case of buying on the dip—or, buying on the news.

By the numbers

52.57

September is living up to its reputation as a tough month for stocks. The S&P 500 is on a four-day losing streak, its longest slide in over a month. That sell-off puts the benchmark in negative territory for September. Concerns over tapering, valuations, global growth and rising Delta numbers are weighing on investors. That’s the bad news. The less-bad news? The S&P is a mere 1.2%—or, 52.57 points—off its all-time high. If you’re looking for catalysts, please note: the start of Q3 earnings season is a good month away. In the meantime, there’s not a heck of a lot on the calendar to excite investors. As such, expect them to obsess over Delta numbers.

8 out of 10

As I say above, we’re about 1% off the S&P record close of 4545.85, which happened last week. That’s important to keep in mind amid this week’s lackluster performance. Just as the August rally was more a melt-up than a 🚀, the September swoon seems like a drip-drip-drip decline. But should this sell-off continue, don’t be surprised if you start to hear the R-word—recession—uttered. As Brad McMillan, CIO for Commonwealth Financial Network, noted yesterday, “recessions are strongly associated with market drawdowns. In fact, 8 of 10 bear markets have occurred during recessions.” He points out that the last one happened in February, citing National Bureau of Economic Research data. That recession was super-brief. It also occurred during one of the worst market sell-offs of 2021. As such, Commonwealth Financial Network has a “yellow light” rating on the U.S. economy at the moment.

Zero

We covered yesterday the bearish call by BofA’s Savita Subramanian. A reminder: BofA now has a 4,250 year-end handle on the S&P, which is roughly 5% below yesterday’s close. She doubled down on that outlook yesterday, telling Bloomberg TV, “The S&P 500 has essentially turned into a 36-year, zero-coupon bond… If you look at the duration of the market today, it’s basically longer duration than it’s ever been. This is what scares me.” She went on to say that any normal shock—inflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rates going up; take your pick—will make the market reaction more volatile than ever. She’s not alone in ringing the alarm. Deutsche Bank, too, is warning of a “hard” equity valuation correction.

Have a good weekend. But first, there’s more news below.

Time to add bonds to your portfolio?

2021-09-22 00:00:00+00:00	This Under-the-Radar Altcoin Is Up 34% This Week Despite the Crypto Market Correction	[]	"As the overall cryptocurrency market moves through a turbulent week, one under-the-radar altcoin is defying the downtrend in a major way.

Decentralized reserve currency protocol Olympus (OHM) has surged by 34% over the past seven days.

A possible catalyst for the price jump is the recent announcement of a new product called Olympus Pro.

While discussing hurdles the blockchain industry traditionally faces acquiring funding and its environmental impact, the team behind the project explains,

“Bonds are a mechanism by which the protocol itself can trade its native token in exchange for assets. Instead of renting liquidity from third parties, it purchases them outright.

Once the bond is created, the protocol owns those assets and, like liquidity mining, has distributed new supply.”

Olympus claims to have raised over $150 million in assets since launching the bonds program six months ago.

The new Olympus Pro X bond marketplace seeks to reduce emissions while helping all players within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

In 11 days we made $10m $DAI through bonds. OlympusDAO Treasury now holds $40m $DAI pic.twitter.com/FiSsA4GFuw — OlympusDAO (@OlympusDAO) September 22, 2021

According to the company’s community manager WartuII,

“OlympusDAO 7-day protocol revenue exceeded the combined revenue of OpenSea, dYdX and PancakeSwap.”

OHM is valued at $625.86 at time of writing, a 34% increase from $465.77 a week ago, according to CoinGecko.

Olympus has also attracted the attention of high-profile investor Mark Cuban.

Over the summer, Cuban invested in Olympus, and as of today has 338 staked tokens (SOHM) with a value of $214,327, according to the portfolio tracker Zerion.

2021-09-23 00:00:00+00:00	e-Naira to roll out on the 1st of October – CBN	['William Ukpe']	"The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed on Wednesday that it has concluded plans for the launch of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the e-Naira on the 1st of October.

This was disclosed by the CBN’s Director of Information Technology, Rukiya Mohammed, on Wednesday, in a webinar, themed: “Digital currency and the prospects of CBDC in Nigeria,” organised by the Committee of e-Business in Industry Heads (CeBIH).

The CBN director said 85% of Central Banks globally were working on their digital currency, citing rising digital payments in Nigeria compared to cash payments, which is declining in Nigerian also.

“CBDC would contribute to macro-economic growth in the country. If people adopt more of the usage of the e-naira, it would enhance more data to formulate macroeconomic policies,” she said.

“Also, when more countries have their own digital currencies, it would increase the exchange of currency and facilitate cross border trade at a lower cost.

News continues after this ad

“Even though Nigeria has a good payment system, this would also improve Nigeria’s payments efficiency,“ she said.

She added that the CBN will partner with currency technology providers including MasterCard, stating that the CBN would focus on low amount payments at the introductory stage and instant settlement with low cost.

“CBDC would be legal tender with one e-Naira equivalent to one naira which shows fundamental differences between CBDC and crypto currencies,” she said.

Dr Adesola Adedutan, the Managing Director of First Bank Nigeria said that there are significant differences between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies, citing that CBDC provides a platform for the governments to leverage blockchain technology to maintain a centralised and institutional role over of the currency.

What you should know

The e-Naira will be a digit representative of the paper Naira currency issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria. The e-Naira will be a “complementary” legal tender in Nigeria, having the same exchange value as the Naira, and maintaining a “parity of value” with the Naira.

The e-Naira will not earn any interest to holders. The e-Naira is built on a blockchain open ledger technology. Creating the e-Naira on the blockchain means you cannot have a duplicate or fake e-Naira. Each e-Naira note will be unique.

Is the e-Naira a stablecoin?

In a previous article by Nairametrics, a stablecoin was defined as a cryptocurrency backed by reserves. The keyword is reserves, but what kind of reserves? Stablecoins are backed by holding an equal equivalent of FIAT money like the US dollar. FIAT means government-issued but usually not backed by any commodity, e.g gold.

Thus, a stablecoin like USDT is tied to a currency, the US dollar, and maintains a stable exchange value. To be a stablecoin, the eNaira has to be tied to a currency like the US Dollar or Euro or even the Yuan."

Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd (HKG: 03333) is under a massive debt crisis. Debt-laden property developer Evergrande has put global markets on a high alert as all markets are interconnected. However, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday confirmed that Europe had restricted direct exposure to the debt trouble that the Chinese company is reeling under at present.

European Central Bank is monitoring developments as they unfold

In conversation with CNBC’s Annette Weisbach in Frankfurt, Germany, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday said:

Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.

“We are looking at it. We are monitoring and I had a briefing earlier on today because I think that all financial markets are interconnected. I have very vivid memories of [the] latest stock market developments in China that had a bearing across the world. But in Europe and in the euro area, in particular, direct exposure would be limited.”

When questioned if the ECB was ready for the anticipated global impact that could occur due to the collapse of Evergrande, Lagarde stated that she could not speak for the U.S. and added that the direct exposure Europe has is limited.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that Evergrande’s debt problems are to do with China. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Powell informed that he does not witness a parallel with the U.S. corporate sector.

Shares of Evergrande in Hong Kong fell around 7% on Friday

Local officials are cautioned to brace for the potential demise of Evergrande, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Meanwhile, shares of Evergrande in the Hong Kong market plunged around 7% on Friday. Market experts echo the sentiments that Evergrande’s liquidity crisis which shows no improvement, can have a ripple impact on the global economy. However, they are optimistic that the Chinese government will take the responsibility to contain the issue."

We discussed the next “big thing” and how to get our hands on it before the big name, big chains take hold. We bring up the dreaded ‘C’ word and ask how the coronavirus opened up opportunities and the waves that have come as a result of the year behind closed doors.

In the fast-paced, technological world we live in, there is always something new, something trending and the next “big thing” happening; we are constantly chasing what is considered cool in society, to keep up with our community’s wants and needs, making it important to “live in the future” to keep up with the evolving trends.

“The large companies fail to see the trends” Colin C. Campbell

The NFT market is exploding!

The new digital world is creating more and more opportunities for anyone to jump into business and have a go at being a startup. The NFT is a lot more flexible than ever and it’s an exciting new world to create, develop and follow trends.

The NFT market is the best place for startups because, usually, the big name, big chain companies fail to see the trends.

Change in laws

Isn’t it amazing when trends open up because of a change in the law? It’s a smart way to jump on the ship before everyone else does. “Part of that is a change in human behavior,” said Jeff. Consumers are now wanting to do more and at a faster speed. The human attention span is diminishing but this is ideal for any company chasing trends.

The virtual world

Covid-19 became the year of working online and the WFH lifestyle, but what did this do for startup companies and trends?

You can be as productive from your virtual spaces! You can work from anywhere!

Cut the commute, cut the awkward office from 9 to 5, and create a better work-life balance.

We can communicate more efficiently; we’ve all become comfortable with Zoom and other audio and video-based apps. We are becoming more involved with AI and its advances.

We started off with Alexa and Siri, but now, AI is finding its way into all areas of business and human life, getting better and smarter, and it’s not stopping any time soon!

Health & AI

There is a potential trend in AI and healthcare, a massive industry that could change the future of the health industry.

As we’ve learnt and experienced with Covid-19, there is a need to keep up with diseases and healthcare treatments, and predicting diseases has never been more important. The topic of health will always be a huge market and a market that will always stay trending because human health is of the utmost importance and a number one priority to not only consumers but to all humankind.

Better energy

Solar, renewable energies, and electric cars are being pushed by government funding, it is a huge industry and a great wave to ride right now!

Laura Shin:

Today’s guest is Roneil Rumburg, co-founder and CEO of Audius. Welcome Roneil.

Roneil Rumburg:

Hey, Laura, thanks so much for having me.

Laura Shin:

Audius has made some headlines recently, having recently scored a deal to enable artists to directly upload their music to TikTok’s sound kit. But before we get into all the details on that, let’s start at the beginning. What is Audius?

Roneil Rumburg:

Audius is a digital streaming service that connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music. And we really see that direct piece of the equation being the key differentiator here. But when you use Audius, it looks and feels like any other music player. You can sign up, make an account, follow your favorite artists, and start listening to their tracks without knowing anything about crypto. But of course, under the hood, the way that Audius operates couldn’t be more different from the traditional SoundCloud or Spotify or something like that. There’s a network of third-party node operators, artists, and fans that together collectively and collaboratively run this network for the benefit of the community and for their own benefit, I guess, too — in the case of the node operators.

Laura Shin:

And at what problem is Audius solving the other music platforms have not.

Roneil Rumburg:

Where the initial inspiration for our Audius came from was my co-founder Forrest and I are just big dance music fans. We’re not native to the music industry or from the music industry, but we were native to crypto a little bit. He and I started mining Litecoin and Dogecoin and some of the other coins in 2013 or so onward. And we just started to see, I guess around 2014 and 2015, a lot of our favorite artists choosing to leave SoundCloud or getting kicked off of SoundCloud in some cases. And all this great music that we had a favorited and followed over the years started disappearing. So when we started to ask ourselves, like, why that was happening. That was really when we started to understand this broader set of issues that, at its core, I would summarize as: artists don’t know who their fans are, where their fans are, or have any ability to like engage or interact directly with them.

Like on Spotify, for example, an artist can message your fans once per year. There’s a specific email template that you have to follow. Spotify exercises some editorial control over it, and that’s it. That’s like your ability to reach your fans. You can’t like link them out to a third party merch store, for example. You can’t do you know you just very much at all with that fan base. There were all these downstream effects of artists just not controlling or having any ownership of their distribution, which included them getting de-platformed, them choosing to depart platforms like SoundCloud.. So yeah, that’s really the core problem we’re solving. It is to give artists control and access to those relationships that they have with their fans.

Laura Shin:

And so how do you do that on Audius?

Roneil Rumburg:

So it’s really by decentralizing that whole stack and toolchain. So even the question of like, what is Audius is not a simple one to answer, just because it doesn’t cleanly fit into the bucket of like, oh, it’s a a so-called DSP in music parlance, or a digital service provider. It’s also not a distributor per se. It kind of has aspects of a number of these things. But what it really looks like is a set of tools that allow an artist to build an audience and engage directly with them with no intermediaries. Our company, or any company, included, right? For the first time, there are zero parties intermediating that that interaction. This has led to like a lot of really neat emergent behavior within the network that we haven’t really seen before in other music streaming services networks.

It really does come down to us being decentralized. Even to launch like the first version of Audius in late 2019, which was not economically incentivized. It was a Testnet, but it was decentralized from day one and fully open source. So that’s what I think that among the artists community allowed this Audius network to start to build trust with them. That the rules aren’t going to change on them. This API that their whole workflow is dependent on is not going to get pulled out from under them. All of these sort of qualities that just had never been possible in music before.

Laura Shin:

And then, do you have examples of what they are doing on the platform that they can’t do on something like a Spotify?

Roneil Rumburg:

One of the coolest emergent behaviors that our community ended up deciding to double down on with some more product features is this remix competition feature. So it was actually an artist named Lido was the first one to kind of like create this behavior. He uploaded a track, and then uploaded all the constituent little pieces of audio that went into creating that track as separate tracks that he flagged as downloadable. So anyone could go download that raw audio. Then he went and posted on Instagram and told his fan base, hey, if you all remix this track using those stems that I uploaded and tag your track with just the like hashtag. I forget exactly what he did. I think it was like the name of the track or something.

He could then go search that hashtag, find everything that remixed it, and then he did Twitch stream going through and listening to them live, and giving feedback, and engaging. So it was a really, really fun. And and we were like this is so cool. Like there has to be a way to kind of better enable that. So we kind of built out like a little bit of UI for this. And then RAC, I think was the next one that ran a remix competition with this. By that time, there was actually a way to formally tag a track as being a remix of another track. And he actually ended up signing, I think, five of the tracks that remixed his track to like an official release under his label.

So these were like just fans of his, that loved RAC’s music and wanted to like just get noticed by like their favorite artist. And now some of them actually are on an official release of his, which is like, so cool. So when you break down all of those barriers that exist between artists and fans, it finally it starts to become possible to just do these like weird, neat things.

Another example that comes to mind is we’ve seen a few artists upload like works in progress of a given track. So they’ll like upload a draft, get feedback on it from the community, iterate on it, upload a new one, see how people like it, and do that a few times. And then the final release, like two or three months later, maybe makes it to a Spotify or to other other services. But the super fans that are like, I want to hear everything this person makes, and I want to engage with it and hang out, there’s no better place to be right now.

Laura Shin:

Wow. I love this. It sounds so cool. It just sounds really fun. It’s like a little DJ mixing party on the internet or something. Something that’s interesting to me about your platform is at this moment in time, I feel like people typically think of anything that brings together culture and crypto as involving NFTs. And that’s actually not the main way you’re using blockchain technology. At least I believe so based on my research. So talk a little bit more about the crypto aspects of Audius.

Roneil Rumburg:

Totally. No, you’re spot on there. The only integration of NFTs today in Audius is, as an artist, you can run like a little storefront page on your profile if you’d like to. So some artists like 3LAU and RAC have these collectibles tabs that they’ve turned on on their profile, and they just put all the NFTs they’ve minted and that they’ve owned there. So it’s kind of like this directory that links out to whatever market might exist, like OpenSea or SuperRare.

We aren’t a native NFT platform by any means. What Audius uses blockchains plural for, and I can get into more of the technical detail around that, is effectively a coordination layer for this network.

So there are these off-chain nodes that host content, host metadata, and kind of do the work that is required to keep the network functional and alive. The way that the network is set up, our company could go away tomorrow and the vast majority of stuff here would would continue to work just fine. It’s because it’s being operated by the community. With Ethereum at the center on the node operator side, and then Solana on the content engagement side provide, are this sort of like unified source of truth for a number of questions. Like who are the nodes on the network? Are they in a healthier, valid state? And then on the content side, what is all the content in this network? Who has engaged with it? Who has the ability to update or modify it? By doing that, we can kind of like anchor trust with these small pieces of data on-chain that refer out to data being stored off-chain on these community-operated nodes.

Laura Shin:

So for the metadata, it’s just like who wrote this track or who performed it. Does that include kind of like royalties the way that a Spotify will pay you for streams? So every time it gets played, then like different people who participate in that song will get paid? How does that work?

Roneil Rumburg:

So it includes everything from the title of the track, the cover art for the track, the name of the artist, and things like that, to things like revenue splits as well. So the network doesn’t natively split revenue today, although it does allow you to define those splits within the metadata. That’s something that I think our community had always planned or wanted to build towards overtime. Even in the absence of that, there is quite a bit of like content that both independent labels have uploaded and a few of the larger players have uploaded. And basically, they handle the splits on their end right now. There’s one address that’s getting paid out royalties and then that that company can decide, hey, I need to split this however I need to, or what have you. On the metadata side is really more just like all the things that go around the audio file itself to make it have meaning or make it interesting.

Laura Shin:

And then you also have the AUDIO token. So what functions does that perform in the Audius system?

Roneil Rumburg:

That has three core functions. It secures the network. So the people who run the nodes that actually do all the work that makes the network functional. They stake the token to be able to run that node. And then they earn fees back from the network proportional to to the size of the stake and the number of nodes that they run. So one of the kind of strange things about the Audius networks needs, compared to like a lot of say layer one blockchains that have their own nodes, is that the need for storage grows forever, right? Like the more people upload, the more people engage, the more storage you need. So the way that the node infrastructure is set up, it’s not like there’s a fixed kind of processing capacity. It’s like the more nodes there are, the more can be stored, the more can be served, et cetera.

So like the crypto-economic structure has to kind of like incentivize a much larger amount of storage to be on the network, then the network actually needs that at any given time. It secures the network. The token is used in governance. From the time the token launched in October of 2020, our team was no longer capable of making any changes to the code that powers Audius. Both for the on-chain smart contracts for like engaging with content and all that good stuff. As well as in the off chain node software. Nodes actually like monitor one another to see that they’re running the most up-to-date version, and they can get slashed if they’re running too far behind and things like that. But to actually accept within the network a new version of the code as being like canonically correct, there has to be a governance vote that that happens.

It’s not one token, one vote, but one token staked within the network is able to vote. So if you just hold tokens passively, you’re not able to participate. But if you’re delegating to a node or you’re running a node yourself, you get to vote on how this goes.

Then the third pillar there is feature access. So as an artist, if you hold and stake some number of tokens, you get access to additional distribution features that may consume more resources at the network level. So the NFT feature is actually one of those. So if you hold more than a hundred AUDIO tokens on your Audius account, you’re able to set up that collectibles tab and connect external wallets and stuff. The reason for that limitation actually is that it costs the network resources to go index all those wallets and basically keep track of all the changes of any holding of NFTs or things like that they have.

Those are the three primary functions. I think the the one misconception that I always like to clear up around this, though, is the AUDIO token is not used for payments within the network, right? So users aren’t purchasing this to consume content or things like that. We talked to many, many, many artists about this as we were kind of working through the testnet. Artists want food and shelter. When they are charging for access to their music, conflating like control of the means of distribution with like their basic needs to like function as a human being in the world, I think is a very dangerous sort of game. Based on all of that feedback, the intent with a lot of that design was to separate these things.

To to say your ability to control your distribution should not come in direct conflict with your ability to feed yourself and support yourself. Mixing them creates some kind of weird dynamics, where the artists that are say selling what they earn to support themselves, that means they’re losing control of the distribution that they’re making valuable. Which is, we felt, not the right sort of incentive structure to create.

Laura Shin:

So then are they earning stablecoins?

Roneil Rumburg:

Monetization and Audius is not fully live right now. So there are folks that are earning in stablecoins, in like very ad hoc ways. So on Audius, every user has a wallet. They’re able to receive anything to that wallet they might please. There’s kind of this like ad hoc economy that’s emerged around that. Just because there are so many people now on the network that have these wallets. The more formal features on monetization are still, I think, being iterated on and worked on by the community. The first goal was always to build a meaningful enough audience within the network before it actually started to make sense for someone to think about monetizing it. And for the first time, I think in the last three or four months, there are some accounts on Audius with tens of thousands of followers, like 20,000-40,000.

For the first time became enough that someone could think about, fey, if 2%-5% of my audience might convert to a paid engagement, like a paid subscription to me, or something like that. That’s now like a real amount of money for that, right? Like 300-600 people engaging on something like that could really move the needle. You’d be surprised how many artists actually, just because of how little they earn for the most part, on traditional streaming services.

Laura Shin:

I have some friends who are musicians and it’s not pretty. One thing I wanted to ask about was for the staking, I realized that because of the price of the AUDIO token, that at the moment it would cost half a million dollars to become one of those node operators that can stake. I think compared to, I’m just trying to remember what the dollar amount was when staking launch on the beacon chain on ETH 2.0, I think it was like $16,000 or something. But I was wondering, is there a reason why it’s so much more? Are you going after some kind of like professional operation? What’s the thinking behind that level? Or is it just that you didn’t anticipate the price would go up this much?

Roneil Rumburg:

The level was intentional. Although, if we could go back and redo history, something that varied a little bit more with the current market dynamic, rather than being a fixed number, would likely make more sense. But the barrier to entry here was intentionally very high. And the reason for that i: to run a node on the Audius network and have it be able to meet the minimum specification and requirement for a node, is pretty expensive. It’s not a straightforward thing to do. And it requires a level of expertise today that’s not broadly accessible yet. So that’s actually why there’s a separation between you can delegate tokens and you can delegate as little as a hundred tokens at a time.

So there’s a much, much longer tail of people, delegating tokens to people who run nodes professionally. The goal was for the folks operating nodes to be like really professional hosting businesses. The other side of this that is worth touching upon is that, because those node operators are professional, real, legitimate hosting businesses, there’s some responsibility that comes as a node operator with respect to the content that gets stored on your node. So if someone uploads something that they don’t own the rights to, for example, as a note operator, you are responsible for like when kind of rights holders file DMCA notices and things like that, to respond to them. I think that’s something worth calling out.

Decentralization does not need to mean like mass sort of infringement of rights. That’s why that’s why the incentives around the network were structured this way. The node operator archetype that is on Audius — someone who has a level of resources that you just mentioned, to be able to come along here has no interest in hosting things that draw like the wrong kind of attention. That’s actually why the Audius has not really had run ins or issues on that front. Our goal with designing this network was to help artists get paid more. Not to defraud them or to take away their livelihood through people putting stuff that isn’t paying the right person.

It was really those two aspects, right? It’s like the complexity of running a node, and to be able to provide a high quality of user experience and service to end-users that are fetching content from those nodes. Just the nature of like music that attracts some not so great behavior. We wanted the people who were running nodes to be like known, named businesses or individuals, that actually like have a presence and exist in the real world. Both decentralization and kind of decentralized control can go hand in hand with respecting the rights of content.

Laura Shin:

I love it. I think that’s just really cool and smart. So a couple of things. So first of all, just for listeners who don’t know what a DMCA takedown is, if I remember correctly, it’s something like the digital millennium copyright act. I’ve sent these out before, where like someone stole my writing and I was like, you need to take that down. So I think that’s great that you are seeking these professional operators who would abide by the law if they were to receive a request like that. And it’s interesting that you just raised this issue. I was going to ask you, like I noticed two years ago, The Verge wrote an article calling your service a copyright nightmare and said it was at that time full of pirated material. And the truth is, actually, when I first started learning about it, I was like, oh, it’s like Napster with a token. Is it just because basically all the node operators are kind of more centralized that they’re handling it. It sounds like it’s not even really been an issue. So are you noticing that these node operators aren’t even getting people uploading pirated stuff?

Roneil Rumburg:

Great questions all around. So there definitely are things getting uploaded to Audius that shouldn’t be, in the same way that they do to YouTube or to SoundCloud or to really anywhere. If you give users the ability to upload things, like there will be some small number of people that sort of misbehave. The reason it’s not become an issue, though more broadly, is that whenever rights holders have approached operators in the network and in the community, at least the feedback we’ve heard, is that 100% of the time, those things have been addressed in a timely fashion. So I think one thing that is really unfortunate right, is sometimes there are folks who write, produce content on the internet, but don’t necessarily fully understand the mechanics of what they’re writing about.

I think that that specific press piece — there were just a lot of things that, unfortunately, I think that reporter got a little bit wrong about the actual situation with respect to the network. Right. If that narrative were true, there would have been a lot more anger and lawsuits, and who knows what else, that would have started flying around from the broader music community. But I think we’ve been fairly warmly embraced by the broader music community. And I think it’s because we took this approach that I just described to you. By being decentralized, but still aligning incentives around positive behavior, you can I think get the best of both worlds here, right?

Like don’t have to trust our company when using Audius. But there is still there are laws and rules that exist for good reason. Allowing people to hide behind the shields of anonymity, in some cases, like you might be able to, if the requirements were much lower or much smaller. I think we felt that would lead to a misalignment around those incentives. We want all the folks who run nodes on the Audius network, which today there I think like 60 or 70 nodes, those should all be known quantities in the world.

Laura Shin:

A couple other things I want to ask about this. So one thing is, and I think I might already know the answer to this, but I did notice that the AUDIO token is set to inflate at a rate of 7% a year. And I was wondering, as I’m sure you’re well aware, a lot of people in the crypto community like coins that have caps or low inflation. But I was curious to hear about why you’re inflating at a somewhat high rate.

Roneil Rumburg:

We felt that it made more sense to distribute the token supply over a very long period of time to the community members that were creating the most value in the ecosystem. That effectively meant that rather than distributing like a very, very large amount of tokens upfront when the network launched, by basically having that happen for perpetuity, that would lead to a better kind of distribution of power and control in the community. A lot of the design around the Audius was sort of inspired by a lot of the ideals that Carl Marx and some of those early philosophers around like sort of capitalist economic structure laid out that, like it should be possible for folks who make a use of capital to earn some of that capital back over time from the work that they do.

For that to be possible, there needs to be some amount of inflation perpetually. But the way that the staking side of the Audius is set up, if you stake and actively participate with your tokens, your percentage of control of the broader network doesn’t get diluted over time. As it stands right now, you actually, by staking, you can grow your percentage of ownership over time just by function of the participation in staking. What it basically means is the network heavily disincentivizes passive holding and incentivizes active participation, right. Because if you just hold those tokens and do nothing with them, you get diluted down at an aggressive rate over time.

One of the interesting things is that like about designing these sort of crypto-economic systems is that we could sit in a room and try and do the best we can, but ultimately, once it’s out in the world, it is in the hands of the community. The decisions that our team made prior to launching the network are now only changeable by the community. All of what I just said aside, there is a growing contingent within the Audius ecosystem that wants to change that inflation rate, I think, for the reason that you just laid out. So it will be interesting to see how that plays out. This is the community’s property and the world’s property. At least I personally would be supportive of whatever they decide here. But that was at least the initial intent here, was that over time the network should be controlled by the people who are actively using it, not by kind of like passive holders of that capital.

Laura Shin:

Laura Shin:

Back to my conversation with Roneil. So we were just talking about how you started as a centralized service, and now governance is in the hand of your token holders. And so I was so curious, earlier today when I had trouble logging into the app, I was wondering, because apps are typically run by centralized services, and I sent you a message saying, oh, hey I’m having trouble logging in, and you said, oh, I’m going to ask the team. So I was wondering, is that a centralized company that you were referring to there? And is it a centralized company that’s running this app on the decentralized protocol? Because like Ethereum has this foundation and the foundation funds these different teams working on different clients or whatever. I mean, it can be outside companies too. I was kind of curious, like what is centralized in Audius and what is decentralized?

Roneil Rumburg:

So there is a Audius foundation that controls the kind of like the projects treasury and allocates those funds out to companies like my company. So there are a few other companies that now exist in the Audius ecosystem as well, that get similar kind of grants from from the foundation. But specifically to your question, and for everyone’s context, this was around Twitter OAuth. So there’s a mechanism that Audius uses to kind of prevent name squatters from registering verified usernames on other platforms. The network will prevent you from registering a handle that is verified on Twitter or Instagram. So when Laura tried to sign up with her verified Twitter handle, the front end was like, you can’t do that or whatever.

That is one aspect of the network’s behavior that is centralized today. And there are a couple of others that I can mention, but it’s not possible to authenticate with Twitter in a decentralized way. However, your wallet when using Audius is still custodied with you. So your account is actually controlled by you. The only aspect of that flow that our company is able to affect is adding that checkmark next to your name. The only way that that happens is if a user either during sign-up or afterwards is able to authenticate with a verified account on another platform. It is a trade-off of usability versus decentralization. There are strategies that people use around this, like Keybase will have people tweet like a message like I’m setting up my Keybase, but I mean, let’s be real here, right?

Like if Steve Aoki signs up for Audius, and both of them use Audius, are they really going to tweet: “I am setting up my Audius account and proving that I’m verified” — like probably not.

So a trade-off had to be made there. There are a couple of other places where kind of like day-to-day engagement with with the network touches some centralized services. So, for example, if you send AUDIO tokens from your wallet, even though your wallet has custody and control of those tokens and the signature around the transactions happening on your browser, we have a relay that will pay the gas for that transaction on your behalf. So you could still transact if you put Ethereum into your wallet to send it, but the vast majority of our users don’t know or understand things about crypto.

So I think where we’ve tried to make these trade-offs is with the goal of usability in mind. But with a hard bright line around the network’s functionality cannot be dependent on us as a central party. So Laura, like you still could sign up for an account. You just wouldn’t be verified, for example. Like if our company was not doing that little verification service, for example. Similarly, you could still send and engage with the tokens within the product, but the usability around it would be degraded. That’s kind of how we went about it. Those were really the two primary things that are centralized right now.

Laura Shin:

So when you said that you were going to ask your team, that was the centralized company that you were asking. When you say there are other companies that are working on Audius, the protocol, then would there be cases where we might end up with more than one Audius app or more than one Audius website?

Roneil Rumburg:

I’m nodding for everyone listening. This isn’t I think as broadly known or people were always shocked when I tell them this: the majority of listening on Audius doesn’t come from the Audius product. I think there are over 50 apps now that exist in the ecosystem, some of which are dedicated music players, but many of them are just random other things. Someone made this Music Racing game, which is super fun. I would recommend everyone try it. You’re in our race car following a track, and there are obstacles in the track that are synchronized with the beat of the music. So you sort of like steer around them, or you can get these like bonuses by hitting them.

Laura Shin:

Is it only for select songs, or is it like some kind of algorithm, so you can do it to any song?

Roneil Rumburg:

Algorithmic. You can do it to any song. There are over half a million tracks on Audius. So this developer was like, I’ve always wanted to make this game, but I never had enough like tracks to do it with fun. Anyone can build their own Audius app. There are even institutional players in the music ecosystem that want to build customized streaming experiences, for example. Or some artists are wanting to build a fan club structure around their streaming kind of front on Audius. It’s a really neat ecosystem that’s kind of sprung up around this. The cool thing here is because like any programmatic interaction that happens with the network, from the core app that our team puts out, can be replicated by or even co-opted by any third party product too, right? There’s no special permissioning or something. And when you use the Audius app on your phone, your phone is actually going and talking directly to nodes on the network. There’s no interaction happening with with our company for like normal use of the product. Outside of the couple of exceptions that I mentioned.

Laura Shin:

Yeah, it’s like MyEtherWallet or MyCrypto.

Roneil Rumburg:

Exactly. Right. Those apps are able to talk directly to Ethereum and do what they need.

Laura Shin:

So it’s funny actually, that we’re ending on this note, because my next question is really relatable to MEW and MyCrypto thing. So when signing up for the service, it also sends an email to the user saying Audius cannot reset your password. I’m sure this is ultra confusing for non-crypto people. I understood what you were saying, but I should just point out right underneath that, is a big button saying, reset my password, or reset your password or whatever. So I was curious, like, so I didn’t click it because I was like this is an emergency button and I’m not in an emergency, so I’m not going to click this right now. But I was curious, like if I were to click it, what would happen? I’m assuming it’s not something that goes through your company. I have no idea, what goes on at that point?

Roneil Rumburg:

What you were interacting with is this kind of novel account management solution that our team developed called a Hedgehog, which is sort of a reference or homage to a there’s this parable of the fox and the hedgehog. The Fox is quick and agile and can do many, many different things. Whereas the hedgehog is only really good at like becoming a ball and then it’s spiky and predators can’t get it. Right. What we were trying to say with the parable there is like MetaMask is this amazing swiss army knife. But for an end-user, it’s very difficult to set up and use. Whereas this Hedgehog solution is like dead simple from a user’s perspective, but it makes a significant number of trade-offs that may or may not make it make sense in other applications, but we felt around Audius, it made sense.

So long story short, what it does, is when you sign up for an Audius, you put in a username and password in the app either on your phone or on desktop. And then your browser is actually using that input to encrypt a locally generated entropy that is secure to your wallet, basically. So there’s a locally-generated private key encrypted locally with that data. And then that encrypted blob is actually what gets emailed to you. That email that you get is actually a self-contained likeability to recover your account. It’s not even password reset per se, because you can just reencrypt the same wallet with a different thing. But we actually were able to set up a mail relay service with no logs enabled and no retention of the messages that it sends. So basically that mail relay is your browser, at the time you sign up, sends your key to this mail relay, which sends it to your email, and then that’s effectively the backup of your private key, is in that email. So it’s literally like embedded in the link that when you click that button could let you recover your account. Like if you forget your password, basically. Calling it password reset was a misnomer. We actually have tried three or four different sets of verbiage on that button. But all of them confused users more than this one, which is why we kept it there. Even though it’s not resetting your password, right. You can just set a new password on the same on the same information. People just got so confused by it.

Laura Shin:

I would suggest that the email say something like Audius the company, cannot reset your password. You can reset it yourself using this button or something. To say Audius can’t reset it and then right underneath is a button saying reset it. I think just like from user experience — I’m not an expert on these things, so you don’t have to take my advice.

Roneil Rumburg:

You’re absolutely right. I think it just shows how challenging usability in crypto still is, right? The fact that like the basic questions of how do you access your account don’t have like, well accepted solutions that the whole world follows is like, it’s also so cool. Cause it means that we’re all like still you’re still super early to this, if you’re listening to this. Thinking about questions like this. We need to do better as a community, right?

Audius today as over 6 million people listening every month and over a hundred thousand artists have uploaded. We do feel strongly that like, it would never have been possible to get to this level of usage without making some trade offs. I think we can all agree that storing a private key in your email is not like a super secure way to do that. But we also go to great lengths to instruct users not to store any meaningful amount of funds in their Audius wallet. And then there’s also a mechanism to connect third-party wallets. So you can connect a MetaMask wallet as well. You can connect a like a number of others, anything that’s like wallet connectable. There’s trade-offs, I think, with all of these things. But I am very proud of the work that our community has done to try to make this accessible to a broader Audius because the majority of users of Audius today have no idea there’s any crypto there, which is pretty cool. They just want to come listen to cool music and hang out with their friends.

Laura Shin:

Yeah. And I have a bunch of questions for you about building a crypto product for non-crypto people. But just because this is a crypto show, I do want to ask one question, because this is something I think my audience cares about for whatever reason, you know how tribal crypto can be. So obviously Solana and Ethereum, I think for a lot of people are seen as somewhat competitive, and you’ve kind of embraced both. And I was curious like why that is, and just as a builder, what you thought Ethereum was good for what Solana was good for, et cetera?

Roneil Rumburg:

At a super high level, I think this tribalism is really damaging, unfortunately. These are tools, right? Like the hammer tribe doesn’t get mad at the mallet tribe because the one is slightly better at some things and one is slightly better at other things. They are just tools — but money is involved. I wish it could be that purely straightforward as I just put it. That genuinely is, how I as a builder in the ecosystem, think about it. These are tools. They are built for a purpose, and you can use them for various purposes. And with that aside, I’ll give the feedback that’s probably going to get me flamed by both sides afterwards.

I think the network effect around Ethereum is just so powerful. That’s the first community in crypto that like I really became part of and got excited about. Prior to Audius, I was a full-time investor at Kleiner Perkins. What really got me excited about crypto more broadly was this ability to program like anything with it. I like Bitcoin, I thought it was cool. Ethereum in my mind, just especially as a software engineer, thinking about it, just opened up this whole world of really cool stuff you can make. The network effect around that persists, right. Everything from you know the ecosystem around tokens and wallets and everything.

The moment that the Audius network launched, it was supported by like hundreds or even thousands of third-party applications, without any of them asking us or us asking them to do anything. Like it just happened.

Solana, by contrast, rather than trying to be everything to everyone took the approach of being really, really, really damn fast and good at a specific set of use cases, which so happens to overlap really, really well with what Audius needs, as well as it overlaps with some things like the Serum DEX and other things. From a usability perspective, Solana lets us confirm things to users far, far faster. It lets us just do much more. The average Audius user never actually touches Ethereum, right.

If 6 million people were touching Ethereum every month from the Audius, I think we would we would be creating a lot of problems for the ecosystem. We would also probably be costing like tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in gas. So I think what I love about Solana is that by being focused. By saying we’re not going to try and be everything to everyone, but we’re going to be really, really, really great for the people who need a significant amount of scale or have usability constraints that Ethereum can’t serve — it’s a fantastic solution for that. I think they both have a place in this world. As do many other tools.

Keep in mind, these are tools. And different tools can be good at different things.

Laura Shin:

Now let’s talk about the user growth because I do think, as you said, it’s not obvious at all when you go to this website or the app that it’s a crypto project. I would be curious to hear from your perspective, how did you get the community to grow to the point where you now have more than 6 million monthly users?

Roneil Rumburg:

I think the credit all lies with with that very community. Our little project team that built the first version of Audius and now has a much more diminished role in the ecosystem, just given the size and the scope of all of the various work that’s going on, that the foundation supports and other things. For our little team of 20 people to be supporting 6 million users just would never have been possible without the community’s embrace and support and active work being done to do that. I’ve been explaining this a lot to a traditional tech people lately.

As I mentioned, that’s the world that I kind of came from before working on Audius. People were just shocked when they hear that our team is so tiny. And we’re not that tiny compared to other crypto projects. Like everyone here listening knows that. But when the community is effectively the marketing team, the hosting team, and infrastructure team, they are like an extended developer team. There are more community people building with Audius than there are like people at my company. You can do so much more by opening up those flood gates.

Laura Shin:

Were there any pivotal moments? Were there kind of like bursts of new users that came to the platform?

Roneil Rumburg:

I can just talk quickly through like our history. The product launched publicly in September of 2019. And that was in like an incentivized testnet capacity. From 2019 to like mid 2020, or so, we grew in these little fits and starts, but were mostly going sideways. The thing that was growing was the base of content uploaded to the network. Content doesn’t go away. As new users come, they upload more content. Content can grow linearly, even if usage is like flat over time. In retrospect, I don’t think we realized this at the time, but there was an inflection point that the network hit around 80,000 to 100,000 tracks. Where there was enough music here that when a random user showed up from the dance community, which was really where our early bread and butter in terms of usage was, they would find stuff that they liked.

Then they would engage, and they would stay and do more. Around August or so of 2020 was really when we saw those metric all kind of shift in lockstep. And my only guess as to why that happened was because there was like enough content here. In August of 2020, there were around I think a 100,000 to 120,000 monthly users on Audius. Today they’re over 6 million. It hasn’t been that long since then. I think it’s just when a viral feedback loop around a kind of network driven product starts to work, it has this runaway effect. It’s self-reinforcing. If more content increases user engagement and retention, the increased user engagement and retention means more artists see that and say, oh, there’s an audience here, and I want to serve them. Which leads to more content. It’s this virtuous cycle that is self perpetuating, but it’s like really hard to get started. The analogy I like to give people is to think about pushing a rock up a hill, and at some point, you crest the hill, and the rock starts rolling away, and then you’re just chasing it and doing the best you can to catch up with it. Because it goes faster and faster as it goes down. The community has been able to scale the level of support and work that they do for one another in a way that like our company never could have. I think that’s what allowed us to grow so quickly.

If we had been a centralized company that controlled all this infrastructure control all of this — even the cost of hosting all of this, let alone the cost of like just basic customer support, people ask questions all the time and stuff — we would need to be like hundreds of people that service the amount of demand that exists here. I do think the community owned aspect of the network allowed growth to multiply and to reinforce itself. But ultimately it’s just the nature of a network that led to this. It was just crossing over some critical mass or a tipping point, however you wanna describe it at some point, just things clicked and started working.

Laura Shin:

And so for the big-name artists on the platform, like Skrillex or Diplo, how did that happen? Did they just hear about it through word of mouth, or did you approach them directly? How do you get these artists with this level of name recognition and join?

Roneil Rumburg:

I’ll talk about those three and then talk about like artists more broadly. So Deadmau5 was actually one of our earliest supporters at Audius. We started talking to his team in late 2018. We got in touch with him and his team. He had specifically been looking for something around this. I mean, actually one of the early theses, like when we were thinking about Audius, was really looking at like what Tidal did or tried to do early on, which was to say, we’re going to make all of the artists that use Tidal owners of Tidal. They literally went in like issued stock warrants to those early artists on Tidal.

That was the early kind of target list that we went after, because we took a lot of inspiration from that. I think they fumbled a lot of things along the way. I’m hopeful that under new ownership, they can find their footing and find their way to is some cool stuff. But Deadmau5, Joel, was one of the earliest supporters of Tidal. When our little email intro crossed over their plate, they kind of had pattern recognized, oh, we’ve seen this before, and this is interesting. We want to learn more. So yeah, he was an interesting case.

Skrillex and Diplo are more kind of the typical case, which is a mix of us messaging them for months and years or whatever. And then eventually they hear about it from enough of their own community of fans, as well as other artists that they follow. There’s a lot of neat content has broken out on Audius or like has been shared on Audius exclusively or for the first time. So a lot of folks were just forced to start engaging in and hanging out on the platform, not necessarily uploading their own stuff, but just to like, stay on top of what trends are emerging. And this has always been like niche by niche, and those niches aggregate and slowly roll up to larger and larger audiences.

One of the earliest niches that got really excited about Audius was this Jersey Club community which is like a specific — they have a specific sound of music that they produce. There are a few really influential and notable folks in that community that kind of anchor it. And a few of those really early folks just happened to come across like some press we got around the product launch in 2019, and we’re like, oh, this is school we’re going to try it. And that was enough to get the whole community on. those people retained and engaged really, really well. For a Diplo or a Skrillex, I think the sentiment that needs to exist for them to want to engage with a new product is that enough of their peers and enough of their fans are already there. We slowly rolled up to that. And today, most of our work artist advocacy is just fielding inbound, which the tables have turned very dramatically.

We stopped being able to do outreach. But in the early days, like I would just sit in DM and cold email people and be like, please try this. Today things are — we just couldn’t keep keep doing that, given the scale that we are at. We are even starting to rely on the community more to educate one another and advocate this more broadly and more publicly. So our artist advocacy work today is really focused on helping the Audius appeal to new and different types of music creators and music listeners. As I mentioned, our early user basis has been mostly dance musicians. There are a lot more folks in hip hop coming on now, and Latin music is the other area we’ve seen a ton of growth more recently.

And a lot of that has been driven by — I think those communities being functionally similar in a lot of ways to the way dance communities are. It’s less top down structured, organized content and much more this like grassroots thing, where things emerge from this diaspora of crazy things happening. Audius is much more well suited to the grassroots, bottoms up sort of approach than the very top-down, institutionalized content kind of approach.

Laura Shin:

So it’s kind of amazing we went this far without getting into the TikTok deal. We have to do that now because we’re already over time. So Audius was selected as TikTok’s partner to enable song transfers on the platform. What does that mean, and why is this such a big deal?

Roneil Rumburg:

Just setting some context to kick us off. It’s actually not very easy to upload audio into TikTok. You’d be surprised the ways that people do it. How do you get like an audio file, like an MP3 file or something, onto your phone? People will email it to themselves. Then put it into the files app on iOS. And then depending on your permissions, TikTok may or may not be able to access it. It’s actually not very simple. To a point that there are artists in our community that will hold their phone up to their laptop and like play the track and record it into TikTok, because it’s easier to do that than to go through this this.

So what the Audius integration enables is a solution to this problem. In Audius, on any track that you yourself uploaded, there’s a one-click shared a TikTok button. And if you click that the content gets pushed into your TikTok account. If you’re using the Audius mobile app, and then assuming that you have TikTokinstalled, it just opens TikTok and pushes the content over. The reason that’s exciting for the Audius network and community is that it now, for the first time, it lets artists kind of draw on the Audius that they have on Tik Tok. There are some folks in the Audius like Wookie, for example, and Dylan Francis is another one. I mean there are people who have millions of followers on TikTok that haven’t been able to monetize very well to date. They now have a chance to kind of start to draw some of that audience over to Audius because the sound, when it’s in TikTok actually shows as, oh, it came from a Audius

We actually, even as a result of that, there’s been a significant kind of uptick in usage metrics, just from people seeing those sounds starting to float around on TikTok. On the TikTok side of things. I think the reason they were excited about this was it just it made it easier for artists to upload stuff. And it’s also worth saying, we’re not the only application that has that functionality. Some other sort of like audio production tools have this natively as well. But we are the first streaming service to have it. So I think for the average creator, this has been a much lower kind of friction way to get content into TikTok.

Laura Shin:

Obviously, Audius doesn’t have the artist space or even anywhere near the number of songs that like a Spotify or Apple Music has. And I did read you have close contacts, I guess, at TikTok. But I’m sure also you must’ve had something in your pitch that they found compelling. Or maybe it doesn’t matter to them, the number of songs that are available. Do you have a sense of what it was that appealed to them about choosing a platform that really is still so much smaller than these other ones that could have been selected?

Roneil Rumburg:

I think a couple of things there. I don’t think this is like a mutually exclusive sort of a thing, right? Like TikTok is within their rights to enable other platforms to do it too. However, I don’t think Spotify, for example, has the rights to redistribute content that’s in Spotify. So a lot of folks don’t realize this. For everyone listening, you actually can’t upload things to Spotify yourself. If you’re a musician, you have to sign up for a third-party distributor service, give them your content, and they push it into Spotify. So it would actually be the distributors kind of role to, to push it into TikTok as well, not Spotify’s. All that said, who knows, maybe they will strike some new licensing structure that allows them to do that.

In the case of Audius, the user who uploads and manages the account has the full control of that content. That’s why only the person who uploaded it is able to actually push it into TikTok. That’s the equivalent of them doing a drag and drop upload directly to TikTok. It just so happens that TikTok doesn’t really have a good a good user experience or workflow around that. I kind of referenced this earlier, like Audius is some parts distributor, some parts streaming service, there’s no other like hybrid kind of approach that covers both sides.

Laura Shin:

Because it’s just a flatter structure. That’s fascinating actually. There’s so many things about how crypto networks will change business models that I find really fascinating, but this is like a prime example. So we’re well over time, but I just want to ask what’s next for the Audius. So what do you have up and coming over the next several months?

Roneil Rumburg:

So there’s so much coming up. And so much that I don’t even know is coming up because there were like just people in the community working on cool stuff. The things that I’m personally most excited about, at least, are monetization tools being much more fleshed out over the coming months. There is a lot of interesting stuff in the pipeline that will help artists better understand and segment their audience. A lot of artists today just don’t really have good answers to basic questions, like who are my fans? How do they find my content? Stuff like that. So all of that raw data exists in the Audius right now, but you need tools to be able to explore it and understand it. So really excited about that as well.

I think you’re gonna continue to see more and more artists in new and different genres or areas of music onboarding and getting excited. The best time is yesterday, but the next best time is today to get started on a new platform and building a new following. You don’t have to be a musician to use Audius. There’s actually a very robust sort of curator ecosystem as well. So if you want to help make playlists, if you want to help curate content by reposting and engaging with it there, there’s a whole kind of ecosystem of folks on that side as well. So I think we’re just going to see more of all of that, I guess. But yeah, the concrete features I mentioned are things that I’m super excited about it.

Laura Shin:

Great. Well, this has been so fun. Where can people learn more about you and the Audius?

Roneil Rumburg:

You can learn more about Audius at audius.org or audius.co. So Audius.org is the information put out by the foundation. Audius.Co is the company that I work on, and there’s a a user experience there that lets you play with the product and engage. Go follow follow the project on Twitter. It’s @audiusproject. That’s where all the best news and updates about the network can be found.

Laura Shin:

And roughly 100,000 Edison customers could see their electricity bills climb by hundreds of dollars a year unless they opt out or significantly change their behavior.

Californians are now facing one of the most sweeping changes to how they pay for energy. Ensuring ratepayers are well-informed about the stakes — and the decisions they have to make — is crucial. Edison could be doing a better job.

A spokesperson for the utility challenged that characterization. We’ll get back to that.

I learned about the Edison rate change from a Palm Springs resident named Lynn Pettit, who sent me a copy of the letter she received from the utility informing her about the transition, which in her case takes effect in December.

“Is it a scam?” she asked.

“I thought at first that the letter seemed reasonable,” Pettit, 85, told me. “Then I read the rest of it and I thought, ‘What?'""

OK, this next bit is a little wonky, so hang in there.

It won’t come as a news flash to anyone that California’s power grid is straining to keep up with demand as climate change affects electricity usage, especially during increasingly sizzling summers.

Crazy-hot temps mean millions of air conditioners running simultaneously. Blackouts are a perennial possibility.

To help fix this, the California Public Utilities Commission ordered Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric to switch most customers to so-called time-of-use rate plans.

The idea is to offer lower rates to people during off-peak hours. Basically, demand is highest between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m., when solar power is less plentiful and energy can cost about 60% more on summer weekdays.

Time-of-use plans allow most ratepayers to save money if they concentrate their energy use — running the washing machine, say — outside that time frame.

Edison has already moved about a million residential customers and most business customers to time-of-use plans. It’s now notifying 2.3 million more residential customers that it’s their turn, with rate changes occurring in waves from November to next April.

Let’s stipulate right here that time-of-use rate plans are a good idea. They incentivize consumers to ease the burden on the power grid, make more use of alternative energy sources and generally be nicer to Mother Nature.

But if the letter received by Pettit is any indication, Edison could be doing a better job selling the concept.

“Time-of-use plans encourage people to use energy at the times of day when renewable energy, like solar and wind, is the most abundant and at the lowest cost,” it says.

“With small changes in your energy habits, you can save money and help our state meet its clean energy goals.”

Then comes the first curve ball. The letter says Pettit and other Edison customers will be moved automatically to time-of-use plans unless they opt out.

Let’s be real clear about this: Opt-outs are almost always a red flag for consumers. They typically signal that something is good for companies but bad for customers.

The sharing of your personal information, for instance. If you don’t want a company doing that, you have to opt out (and even then, businesses will still do it on a limited basis).

Companies are well aware that relatively few consumers will make the effort to opt out of things, which is why important decisions are routinely presented as opt-outs rather than opt-ins. Call it corporate coercion.

By the same token, though, many if not most consumers won’t opt in to things that they didn’t initiate. They’ll ignore the offer.

This is a Catch-22 of modern life. Opt-outs are often unfair. Opt-ins are frequently ineffective.

Edison’s letter to Pettit makes clear that the change to her rate plan is not in her favor. It states that, under her current plan, she pays about $4,467 a year for power.

Under the pending time-of-use plan, it says, she’ll pay $4,705 a year — a more than 5% rate hike.

The letter says that for the first 12 months after the switch, she’ll receive a one-time credit from Edison if her time-of-use bills exceed her current payments. It says she can switch back to her current plan during the first year. Once-a-year changes are also possible after this time.

“I wonder how many people won’t read the letter, or won’t check their bills on a regular basis,” Pettit told me. “The only reasonable way to do this is to ask people to opt in.”

Normally I’d agree with that. But in this case, the stakes are exceedingly high, and it’s crucial that as many Californians as possible participate in the new rate plan.

Ron Gales, an Edison spokesperson, said the Southern California utility and Northern California’s PG&E originally favored the idea of opt-ins when statewide plans for the switch to time-of-use rates started taking shape about a decade ago.

California regulators, however, saw that Sacramento’s community-owned utility had better luck with opt-outs, so the edict was handed down: Opt-outs for all.

From Edison’s perspective, this was the right move.

Gales told me that when the utility tested opt-ins with some customers, only about 5% agreed to switch to the new plan. That’s 95% who either didn’t want to change or couldn’t be bothered to even think about it.

“We’re trying to alter the behavior of millions of people,” Gales observed. “How do you do that if hardly anyone opts in?”

San Diego’s utility finished moving eligible residential customers to time-of-use rates in May 2020. According to the PUC, 98% of the total remained on the new plan.

Gales said most Edison customers will see lower bills as a result of moving to time-of-use plans and making modest changes to their energy use.

But he acknowledged that for about 100,000 “extreme non-benefitters” such as Pettit, average monthly bills could rise by as much as 10% from current levels.

“We recognize that,” he told me. “We’ll be following up with such people by phone.”

I pointed out that amid a proliferation of scam calls, many people no longer pick up the phone. “That’s a valid point,” Gales acknowledged — another quirk of modern life.

Where Edison dropped the ball, I think, is in making the case to the tens of thousands of people like Pettit who will look at their letters and conclude they’re being hit with a hefty rate increase.

Gales explained that the estimates for current payments versus time-of-use payments don’t factor in behavioral changes a customer might make.

That is, Pettit and others could still see their bills go down if they adjust their energy use to avoid peak hours.

Edison could have done a better job communicating this.

What it should have done is provide not two but three data points — estimated current bills, estimated time-of-use bills and estimated time-of-use bills with new behavior factored in.

Gales said Edison’s honchos considered estimating for people like Pettit how much their bills could decline if they adapted to time-of-use conditions. “We just didn’t have a lot of confidence in our numbers,” he conceded.

I said earlier this was wonky. Now you see why.

The bottom line for all Californians is that the changeover to time-of-use rates is a good thing and should help us better manage our energy resources, especially on hot summer days.

Edison could have explained this better. It should have explained this better.

But now you know."
