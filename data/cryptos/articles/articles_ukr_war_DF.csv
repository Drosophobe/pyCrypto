2022-04-11 21:11:27+00:00	Crypto Market Melts Down as Bitcoin Drops 15%, Ethereum Loses 14%	['Decrypt', 'Jeff Benson']	"Bitcoin dropped 15% in 24 hours today, falling below $40,000 for the first time since March 15. Meanwhile, Ethereum dipped 14%, finding itself beneath the $3,000 mark for the first time since March 23.

It's part of a larger trend, with crypto markets tumbling 8.5% in the span of 24 hours to hit a market cap of $1.84 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

If you're looking for plausible answers as to why, it's worth checking out the equities markets. The S&P 500, an index of 500 top publicly traded companies in the U.S., closed down 1.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Monday 1.2% lower, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost a full 2.2% of its value.

Bitcoin, which is historically fairly correlated to other cryptocurrency prices is, of late, increasingly correlated with stock prices. In March, BTC's price correlation with the S&P 500 hit 0.49, with -1 meaning they move exactly opposite and 1 meaning they move in perfect tandem. It was the highest rate since October 2020, per Arcane Research.

But what's going on with stock prices?

Take your pick. There's the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine, a new round of COVID lockdowns in China, and, of course, the Federal Reserve's decision to aggressively raise interest rates and choke off the supply of money into the economy.

The Nasdaq was already down nearly 4% from Monday through Friday last week. The weekend hasn't made things much better. With less money pumping into the economy as the Fed seeks to fight inflation, crypto market caps very well may deflate, according to BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. The billionaire investment banker-turned crypto entrepreneur wrote on Sunday of a ""coming crypto carnage"" and predicted that both Bitcoin and Ether had much further to fall.

""Bitcoin and Ether will bottom well before the Fed acts and U-turns its policy from tight to loose,"" he wrote. He predicted they will test the $30,000 and $2,500 thresholds before the end of June.

Hayes previously predicted, when the price of BTC was below $5,000, that it would reach $10,000 in 2019. That turned out to be prescient, as the price rallied to above $12,000. A year earlier, he suggested that BTC could hit $50,000 that year and would bottom out at between $3,000 and $5,000. While he was way off on the former, the latter prediction was correct.

Bitcoin bulls are hoping Hayes' most recent prediction is wrong. But a look at today's price movements indicates he could be on to something."

He Began Writing About Blockchain Technology In He Has Managed Numerous Crypto-Related Projects', 'Is Passionate About All Things Blockchain.']	"Bitcoin was rejected at $43,000 once again, and the bears pushed the asset to and below $42,000. Most altcoins are also deep in the red, with ETH close to $3,100. The total market cap is down to just over $1.9 trillion.

Bitcoin Tests $42K

It was just a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency was attempting to overcome $47,000 but failed on both occasions. Just the opposite, the asset started to lose value gradually and slipped to $45,000 a day later.

The bears kept control over the market and pushed it south again. At first, BTC dropped to $44,000 before it plummeted to $43,000, which became its lowest price point in more than two weeks.

In the following few days, bitcoin remained stuck between $43,000 and $44,000. However, its inability to climb above the latter meant more trouble. This time, it fell to $42,000 as reported yesterday.

It bounced off hours later and briefly exceeded $43,000, but the bears came back to play and drove it south below the January 2021 ATH of $42,000, where it’s currently situated as well. As such, its market capitalization has slid below $800 billion for the first time in nearly three weeks.

Altcoins Back in Red

The altcoins calmed yesterday after the recent price declines, but the past 24 hours spelled more trouble. Ethereum is down by 4% on the day and sits just above $3,100. It’s worth noting that ETH jumped above $3,500 to a three-month high last week.

Binance Coin, Solana, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and CRO have retraced by similar percentages, while Ripple and Cardano are down by more than 5%.

More losses are evident from Terra (-9%), Avalanche (-7%), Polkadot (-8%), and NEAR Protocol (-8%).

The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets is down to just over $1.9 trillion, meaning that the metric has shed $250 billion in about a week."

Crypto news and prices of BTC, Ethereum, Solana as Russia invades Ukraine	[]	"Bitcoin’s price has fallen even lower after the cryptocurrency market dipped into a crash this week as the toll of increased conflict in Europe and Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine saw markets fall worldwide.

The cryptocurrency market is currently down by more than 10% on Thursday morning, as of 11.20am UK time, according to Coinbase.

After a continued lull for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, it now looks to be approaching a $30,000 threshold today (Thursday February 24) should market dips continue.

As of 11.34am on Thursday, Bitcoin’s price was fluctuating at around $34,966.62 (£26,080.62) in a 10.23% fall on the last 24 hours, and a 19% fall on the last seven days, according to Coinbase.

The cryptocurrency market has been struggling to return to highs reached in late 2021 as inflation, looming conflict in Europe and global market uncertainty over crypto risks continue to push crypto price thresholds lower.

The crypto market dip, reflecting a fall on the FTSE 100, comes as Russia increases its attacks on Ukraine and launched a full scale invasion of the country, as the EU, UK and US propose further sanctions on the country.

NATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg said in a statement on Thursday afternoon that Russia has launched missile attacks targeting Ukraine’s military infrastructure in an ""unjustified and unprovoked"" attack on the country.

""This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long planned invasion,"" he added.

The downward slide in crypto prices suggests that the crash which saw prices plummet in early January, as Kazakhstan’s crypto mining empire took a hit during political unrest, could be set to continue amid a wider market sell-off.

Here’s why crypto is down today, what’s happening to crypto at the moment and the latest prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, Shiba Inu coin and Dogecoin.

What is Bitcoin’s price today?

Bitcoin’s price is currently trading at $35,452.90 (£26,417.69) in a 9% fall on the last 24 hours as of 11.58am, according to Coinbase.

Bitcoin has been fluctuating between $36,000 and $38,000 in value this week after falling from its $40,000 threshold again on Sunday February 20.

But in the early hours of Thursday morning, Bitcoin’s price dropped from $36,887.71 at 2.30am to $34,787.94 at 4.30am, with this plunging even lower later this morning as its price dropped to $34,322 at 5.45am.

According to data collected by CoinMarketCap, however, Bitcoin is seeing increased trading activity – with its 24 hour trading volume up 55.6% as of 12.03pm on Thursday at $37,439,624,337 as investors buy the dip.

Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating mostly between $40,000 and $45,000 – hitting a recent high of $52,100 on December 27.

The major cryptocurrency’s price has seen recent gains of almost $20,000 wiped off the board for Bitcoin after it came the closest it ever has to reaching a new landmark threshold of $70,000 in November.

Why is crypto down today?

Bitcoin’s price enjoyed a bullish rise to near $70,000 in value in early November as investors hoped to see the cryptocurrency’s $1 trillion market cap remain firmly in place ahead of a volatile trading period.

But its plummet below $50,000 came in late 2021 as US and UK markets struggled to contend with increased concerns over increasing inflation and looming conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Such concerns have now come to a head with Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday February 24 2022, with fears for global market stability, national security and Ukraine’s safety taking hold as oil prices surge, traditional markets drop and more sanctions on Russia are to be declared.

Bitcoin’s price dipped below $40,000 on Friday January 21 after the Russian central bank published a consultation paper which warned that ‘growth of cryptocurrencies use creates threats for Russian retail investors, financial stability and threats associated with the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities’.

The report cited estimates that cryptocurrency transactions among Russian citizens totals up to $5 billion a year.

In particular, the report focused on the threats of cryptocurrency’s high volatility and instability for individual citizens, as well as its fraudulent and criminal usage.

However, the Russian central bank also likened the global growth of cryptocurrencies in Russia to ‘dollarisation’, stating that ‘cryptoisation limits monetary policy sovereignty, which might force central bank to permanently maintain a higher key rate to contain inflation’.

It added that ‘the spread of cryptocurrencies could make people withdraw their savings from the Russian financial sector and, subsequently, decrease its capability to finance the real sector and potential economic growth reducing the number of jobs and potential for household income increase.’

Meanwhile, the UK Government outlined a tougher approach to crypto-asset promotion and advertising in a statement in mid-January.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims.

""We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.”

On Monday January 24, US market analysts warned that the rise in inflation could see the US Federal Open Market Committee take faster, earlier action in coming months to tighten US monetary policy – prompting fears in traditional and cryptocurrency markets to take hold in another huge sell-off.

Cryptocurrency market prices today

With cryptocurrencies often moving in tandem with Bitcoin, Ethereum, the cryptocurrency synonymous with the rising crypto trend of NFTs, was trading down by

more than 11% on Thursday after hitting a new record high of almost $5,000 in early November.

Ethereum’s price has dipped further below its previous $3,000 threshold and was trading at $2,388.18 (£1,779.49) at 11.43am on Thursday, in a further 11.14% fall on the last 24 hours.

The hype surrounding popular memecoin Dogecoin has likewise been fluctuating in recent months as new alt and meme coins have stolen the spotlight.

Dogecoin’s price was trading down by more than 17% on the last 24 hours at $0.11 (£0.08) on Thursday morning.

Shiba Inu coin, the so-called ‘Dogecoin killer’, was trading almost 20% down on the last 24 hours at $0.00002170 (£0.00001620) as of 11.46am on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Cardano’s (ADA) price is fluctuating around $0.76 (£0.57) in 18.56% fall on the last 24 hours, XRP was down 13.19% at $0.64 (£0.47) and Solana was down by 12.7% at $81.20 (£60.60) as of 11.47am on Thursday.

When was the last crypto crash?

In June, the Chinese Government cracked down on considerable crypto mining operations taking place in the Sichuan province and demanded that Chinese banks and payment channels stop supporting decentralised and anonymous crypto transactions.

This saw Bitcoin prices tumble to below $30,000 in a dramatic plummet from its soaring success.

The cryptocurrency has continued to rise and fall as other global administrations and regulators mull legislation to curb increased crypto activity often attributed to laundering and crime.

Following the Chinese state’s move, countries like South Korea also pledged to tackle the rise in money laundering taking place via cryptocurrency, while the Metropolitan Police announced that it had successfully closed in on a huge UK cryptocurrency money-laundering operation.

July saw the Met seize a cryptocurrency operation valued at £180million in the UK’s largest cryptocurrency seizure to date.

Cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Binance have since been feeling the heat across the world as regulators and governments began to turn the screws on the operations of such platforms in the wake of crypto’s global crackdown.

The result of this saw Bitcoin’s highest prices sliced in half in June, with the coin struggling to break out of the low to mid $30k price range until it received a welcome boost from Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his appearance at major Bitcoin conference in July.

The bullish rise and increased confidence in Bitcoin could see it remain at prices fluctuating between $60,000 and $70,000 in future, but with increased resistance as it lurches further away from a previous $100,000 price prediction for 2022.

His Work Can Be Found In Numerous Magazines In Australia On Topics Ranging Culture To Science. Lachlan Holds A Bachelor S Degree In Journalism Macleay College In Australia.']	"After weeks of high volatility, the crypto market is on the rise, showing steady gains over the past week as Bitcoin breached US$44,000 for the first time since March 3.

Ethereum and Solana were among the biggest movers on Friday Asia time, each showing double-digit gains, while market leader Bitcoin is up almost 10%.



Cardano was one of the strongest performers this week, gaining almost 40% to trade at US$1.16 at press time — its highest point since early February. Ethereum Classic led the week with nearly 80% gains.

After a market cap peak at over US$3 trillion last November, a series of global shocks have seen crypto prices drop roughly 40%, though experts tell Forkast that may be on the mend.

“Clearly, there’s been a sentiment shift in crypto markets,” Justin d’Anethan, institutional sales director at Amber Group, told Forkast. “How long it will last remains to be seen but, for now, investors are bolstered by positive news.”



In a major milestone for the industry, banking giant Goldman Sachs conducted its first over-the-counter crypto options trade on Monday, becoming the first major U.S. bank to do so.

Additionally, Terra founder Do Kwon announced it was planning on buying US$10 billion worth of Bitcoin for its reserves in its algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem.

“That kind of news impacts perception of the stability of the asset and the long-term view of it,” said Jonathon Miller. The Australian managing director of crypto exchange Kraken told Forkast that Bitcoin’s perception as a reserve asset is growing for both traditional and crypto companies.

Inflationary concerns remain in the market, Miller said, dismissing concerns Bitcoin had not been behaving as a hedge against this inflation in recent months.

“The hedge narrative for Bitcoin still remains true,” Miller said. “It may not have performed as strongly as some other like gold in the very, very short run. But in the medium to long run, Bitcoin is a very high-performing noncorrelated asset class.”

Macro markets have also begun to improve recently, d’Anethan told Forkast, as investors grow accustomed to the state of geopolitical tensions and the recently announced interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat inflation, raising the target range to 0.25% to 0.5%.

“It’s created a risk-on atmosphere where investors are happy to put capital to use rather than standing on the sidelines,” d’Anethan said. “And that definitely includes crypto allocation, both from retail and institutional players.”"
2022-03-14 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptocurrencies in the EU: new rules to boost benefits and curb threats	[]	"On Monday evening, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee adopted, with 31 votes to 4 and 23 abstentions, its negotiating position on new rules on crypto-assets. They aim to boost users’ confidence and support the development of digital services and alternative payment instruments.

Key provisions agreed by MEPs for those issuing and trading crypto-assets (including asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens) cover transparency, disclosure, authorisation and supervision of transactions. Consumers would be better informed about risks, costs and charges. In addition, the legal framework supports market integrity and financial stability by regulating public offers of crypto-assets. Finally, the agreed text includes measures against market manipulation and to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities.

Environmental threats

To reduce the high carbon footprint of crypto-currencies, particularly of the mechanisms used to validate transactions, MEPs ask the Commission to present MEPs with a legislative proposal to include in the EU taxonomy (a classification system) for sustainable activities any crypto-asset mining activities that contribute substantially to climate change, by 1 January 2025.

MEPs stress that other industries (e.g. the video games and entertainment industry, data centres) also consume energy resources that are not climate-friendly. They call for the Commission to work on legislation addressing these issues across different sectors.

Supervision

MEPs want the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to supervise the issuance of asset-referenced tokens, whereas the European Banking Authority (EBA) will be in charge of supervising electronic money tokens.

Quote

Stefan Berger (EPP, DE), the lead MEP, said: ""By adopting the MiCA report, the European Parliament has paved the way for an innovation-friendly crypto-regulation that can set standards worldwide. The regulation being created is pioneering in terms of innovation, consumer protection, legal certainty and the establishment of reliable supervisory structures in the field of crypto-assets. Many countries around the world will now take a close look at MiCA.""

Next steps

A decision to enter into negotiations with EU governments on the final shape of the bill was adopted with 33 votes to 25.

Background

Crypto-assets, including cryptocurrencies, are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority. They are currently out of the scope of EU legislation. This creates risks for consumer protection and financial stability, and could lead to market manipulation and financial crime. The draft legislation differentiates between crypto assets in general, asset referenced tokens (ARTs), also called “stable coins”, and e-money tokens primarily used for payments.

Mechanisms used to validate transactions in crypto-assets have a substantial environmental impact, particularly for proof-of-work mechanisms, requiring a lot of energy and resulting in a high carbon footprint and generating electronic waste. According to most estimates, the energy consumption of Bitcoin equals that of entire small countries."
2022-04-05 17:00:50+00:00	Crypto Market Comes To A Standstill As Sentiment Rolls Into Neutral	[]	"The Crypto market has been fluctuating heavily in the past couple of weeks but with last week’s rally had finally landed into the greed territory. However, as the rally had slowed down and the inevitable market correction had begun, sentiment had begun to shift once again into the negative. This had caused the Fear & Greed Index to reverse out of the greed territory, finally ending in neutral. Now, the market remains at a standstill waiting for the next move.

Crypto Fear & Greed Index In Neutral

The crypto Fear & Greed Index helps map out how investors are feeling towards the market. Currently, it is neither good nor bad which has seen the index languishing in neutral territory. It is important to note that sentiment had driven far into greed as bitcoin had made its way to $47,000 but now, most of that positive sentiment seems to have washed away after bitcoin had made a slight decline that brought it back into the $46,000 region.

With bitcoin’s decline, the whole market had naturally taken a tumble along with it. This inevitably brought down the total market cap back into the low $2 trillion. Nevertheless, the market has begun to recover once more, which would explain why the index did not completely slip into the fear region.

Last week, the index had finished in greed, a stark contrast to the extreme fear in which the index had closed the previous month. The current location of the index at a neutral 52 suggests that investors are not making any important moves in the market. Mostly, the buys and sells have been balancing out each other and investors are not moving either way at present.

This is easily understandable given that the market had mostly slowed to a crawl in terms of momentum. Top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to trend in the same region, struggling to make it above the next significant resistance points. While the rest of the market waits to follow what the market leaders do.

However, since the majority of the market continues to trade in the green, the Fear & Greed is skewed towards greed despite being in the neutral territory. With what looks like another bounce-off point for the crypto market, the index may very well be back in greed before the week runs out.

2022-03-29 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin's rise in value has helped a bullish crypto market cruise past $2 trillion	[]	"As a bleak first quarter draws to a close, crypto seems to have the wind in its sails. It has pushed through the $2 trillion (€1.8 trillion) barrier and is proving surprisingly resilient amid global chaos.

At Monday's high of $47,765 (€42,955), market leader Bitcoin broke above the narrow $34,000-$44,000 (€30,500-€39,500) range it's traded in for most of 2022.

Through a steady grind higher from a low just above $40,000 (€35,972) on March 21, it has gained 18 per cent.

Its comparative steadiness, versus previous performance at least, contrasts with stock markets, traditional currencies and even safe-haven gold, which have been shaken by the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as the Federal Reserve's tightening.

Bitcoin's jumpiness has waned of late.

Its 30-day volatility is around 4 per cent, about two-thirds the level it was in June 2021, according to futures trading platform Coinglass. The highest this year was 4.56 per cent on March 16.

This measures its deviation from its own standard levels, and bitcoin has still had wild swings, such as a 17 per cent jump on March 1. But it's distinctly tamer than in 2021 when it could move as much as 40 per cent in a day.

By comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has whipsawed 5-6 per cent on numerous days in 2022, and was down 20 per cent for the year as of March 14, before it rallied to cut half that loss.

""The largest conflict we've seen in Europe since World War Two has really rocked global markets,"" said Pierce Crosby, General Manager at charting platform TradingView in New York.

""What we have seen across other major assets is a huge fallout - from both the U.S. equity markets as well as global markets,"" he added.

""Bitcoin has more or less stayed in a pretty tight range ... but actually, in terms of the relative strength, it's very bullish"".

Crypto market worth more than $2 trillion

The total value of the cryptocurrency market rose above $2 trillion (€1.8 trillion) on Friday, according to analytics platform CoinMarketCap. To put that in context, the market briefly hit $3 trillion (€2.7 trillion) on November 10, when bitcoin reached $69,000 (€62,000).

The meandering climb back above $2 trillion (€1.8 trillion) has been slow and has also been helped by a mushrooming in coins and tokens - the number CoinMarketCap counts has risen by almost 5,000 since November to stand at 18,511 cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin's market capitalisation has reached $902 billion (€812.5 billion), but it still has a ways to go to reclaim the $1 trillion (€900 million) it commanded in November. While still the dominant crypto, its market share has also fallen gradually from as much as 70 per cent of the total capitalisation in early 2021 to 42 per cent now.

What lies ahead?

Many a crypto investor has thought they could divine bitcoin's direction before the fickle cryptocurrency left them sprawled in the financial dust.

""Although bitcoin is remaining strong in the short term, rising oil prices increase the likelihood of a recession over the coming year or so,"" said Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at UK-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock.

""Oil has increased by around 25 per cent in the past six days alone, and bitcoin bulls will want to see this tail off for continued strength"".

That said, certain other technical factors are pointing to Bitcoin bullishness.

Funding rates, which measure the cost of holding Bitcoin via futures, have turned marginally positive after being negative for most of this year, indicating investors are prepared to pay to be long.

It stands at 0.003 per cent on analytics platform CryptoQuant, though still below a peak of 0.06 per cent hit in October.

Coinglass's longs-to-shorts ratio has also climbed from 0.95 on March 20 to 1.1, the highest level in at least four weeks.

Blockchain data provider Chainalysis said an increasing proportion of bitcoin – nearly 60 per cent of total supply – was being held for longer than 52 weeks, up from 54.72 per cent in the last 25 weeks.

Yet Ashwath Balakrishnan, vice president of research at Delphi Digital in Bengaluru, cautioned that it was difficult to identify a lasting market direction.

""Everyone's a little cautious,"" he said. ""If [Bitcoin] rejects off of $46k [€41,441] and goes back down then it probably means we're stuck with range-bound conditions for at least another month or so""."
2022-02-24 06:19:39+00:00	Crypto Markets Dump $200B as Russia Begins Military Action in Ukraine	[]	"The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has slumped more than 8% over the past 12 hours or so as Russia commences military action in Ukraine.

Around $200 billion has left the digital asset space over the past 12 hours resulting in a massive market slump which has dropped total market capitalization to a seven-month low.

At the time of press, the total market cap was around $1.64 trillion according to CoinGecko, its lowest level since early August 2021. The selloff escalated around 12 hours ago as news broke that Russia had engaged in military action against Ukrainian targets.

Sponsored Sponsored

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine early Thursday and explosions have been reported in several cities. ZeroHedge also reported that Moscow has suspended trading on the Russian stock markets and bourses across Asia are slumping at the moment as the specter of war becomes a reality.

Crypto assets in the red

Cryptocurrencies have been hit particularly hard as the market selloff accelerates. Bitcoin has tanked 8.6% on the day and was trading at $34,725 at the time of writing, its lowest level since the dip on January 24.

BTC is currently 49% down from its November all-time high as it compounds the 21% it has dumped over the past seven days. The world’s leading cryptocurrency is playing the pied piper again as all of those below it have tanked even harder.

Sponsored Sponsored

Ethereum has shed a painful 10% on the day with ETH prices dumping to $2,382 at the time of writing. This is the lowest the asset has fallen to since Jan. 24 and it is on track to drop to a seven-month low.

The rest of the crypto market is a sea of red at the moment with Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) slumping between 9 and 13 percent. The only tokens in the green at the moment are stablecoins.

Gold prices spike

Gold is one of the few commodities that have increased in value at the moment, and this is usually the case with store of value assets during times of turmoil. The spot price of gold spiked to $1,948/oz a few hours ago, its highest level since early January 2021.

2022-04-11 03:18:01+00:00	Cryptocurrency prices today plunge; Bitcoin below $42,000, Terra falls 9%. Check latest rates	[]	"Bitcoin briefly dropped below its 50-day moving average, sliding back further into the range in which it has traded this year. The digital token fell over 2% to $41,917. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency is down more than 9% in 2022 (year-to-date or YTD) so far.

Bitcoin has been in a trading range of around $35,000 to $45,000 for much of the year so far. The breakout above $48,000 last month took the cryptocurrency's price to year-to-date highs, but the token hit resistance around its 200-day moving average.

On the other hand, Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain and the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, also tanked more than 5% to $3,179. Meanwhile, dogecoin price plummeted by over 3% to $0.14 whereas Shiba Inu was trading also over 3% lower at $0.000024.

The performance of other digital tokens also declined with Litecoin, Stellar, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, Polygon, Uniswap prices were trading with cuts over the last 24 hours, and Terra slipped over 9%. The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation was above the $2 trillion mark even as it plunged to $2.04 trillion, down more than 2% change in the last 24 hours, as per CoinGecko.

Bitcoin’s tendency to move in sync with assets such as US stocks makes the drop less of a surprise after a tough week for American markets last week. Its correlation with the Nasdaq 100 Index is now back at record levels, as reported by Bloomberg.

Stablecoin capitalization is a commonly used metric that tracks the total volume of funds entering and leaving a class of assets. According to the provided data, it currently stays at approximately $180 billion, up from $38 billion only a year ago.

The long-term rise in the capitalization of stablecoins is not suggesting any abnormal or negative activity on the market, but the short-term spike in inflows to stablecoins could reflect fundamental issues on the market as more traders and investors move their funds to stable solutions rather than betting on risky assets like Bitcoin and altcoins.

It is important to note that the popularity of stablecoins has risen due to the development of borrowing and lending solutions that allow users to receive stable income thanks to DeFi platforms.

But whenever the crypto market capitalization shrinks and the stablecoin supply rises or remains the same, it most likely suggests that the majority of players on the market moved their funds into stable solutions to avoid additional losses. The same trend is being observed now as the biggest stablecoin on the market, Tether, faced a $3 billion market capitalization increase in the last six days.

At press time, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market remains at $1.7 trillion, with a $100 billion increase since yesterday's crypto market sell-off."

The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin has dipped 10%, while Ethereum and other assets have suffered worse.

Russia's stock market has also plummeted, plunging around 45% on the day before recouping some losses.

Over $200 billion in value has been wiped out of the crypto market after Russia launched a full-blown military attack on Ukraine earlier this morning. The two biggest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are down 10% and 13.6% at press time.

Crypto Market Plummets on Russian Military Attack

Global markets are feeling the effects of Russia’s military attack on Ukraine—and crypto assets have been particularly hard hit.

The crypto market has dipped around 11% and lost over $200 billion in value in the last 24 hours. While physical gold has soared over 2.22% to its highest price in over a year, Bitcoin—often dubbed “digital gold” in crypto circles—has plunged 10% today, trading just above $35,000.

Earlier this morning, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized and announced a “special military operation” against Ukraine. Explosions in multiple cities across the country were reportedly heard within minutes of the broadcast. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared martial law and called on all citizens to defend the country, saying Kyiv would issue weapons to everyone who wanted them. Ukraine’s military has said that over 50 Russian soliders have been killed and six warplanes destroyed so far. Thousands of Ukrainian citizens are already feeling the country.

The latest price action bodes poorly for Bitcoin’s “safe haven” narrative as investors have started offloading their holdings to seek refuge from the turbulence caused by the invasion. Other cryptocurrencies haven’t fared any better. The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is down 13.6%, while plenty of lower cap coins, including recent gainers like Kadena and Fantom, are down even further.

Like the crypto market, stocks have also plunged significantly today across the board. Russian shares were hit the hardest—and by a wide margin. Moscow’s biggest index fund, the IMOEX, marked its biggest daily drop in history—falling 45% before recouping some of its losses. It is currently trading 30% down on the day. The American S&P500, meanwhile, has dipped around 1.8%.

The crypto market has been trading downwards or sideways for the last four months, with the latest geopolitical and macroeconomic developments only worsening its prospects. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both down around 50% from their all-time highs made in November, while lower cap crypto assets such as alternative Layer 1 and DeFi coins, have mostly erased 70% to 90% of their gains over the same period.

The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently about $1.6 trillion. It’s almost 50% down from its $3 trillion high recorded in November.

His Interests Lie In Bitcoin Security', 'Open-Source Systems', 'Network Effects', 'The Intersection Between Economics']	"JPMorgan Sees Limited Upside for Crypto Markets

JPMorgan Chase & Co. has warned that any upside for crypto markets from here would likely be more limited. Basing their prediction on the relationship between stablecoins and the rest of the crypto market, the bank’s analyst explained that stablecoins’ share of the total crypto market cap “no longer looks excessive.”

JPMorgan’s Crypto Outlook

Global investment bank JPMorgan reportedly warned about cryptocurrency markets having limited upside in a note published last week.

JPMorgan sees stablecoins’ share of the total cryptocurrency market value as an indicator of potential for rallies or declines. Previously, when stablecoins accounted for almost 10% of the total crypto market cap, JPMorgan analyst Panigirtzoglou said it “pointed to further upside for crypto markets.”

In the note issued last week, he explained: “The share of stablecoins in total crypto market cap no longer looks excessive … This share currently stands below 7% which brings it back to its trend since 2020.” The JPMorgan analyst continued:

As a result we believe that any further upside for crypto markets from here would likely be more limited.

Panigirtzoglou pointed out that the price of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied in early March following financial sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries after its invasion of Ukraine.

The note describes: “These sanctions had raised expectations that cryptocurrencies will be used more extensively in the future to circumvent the traditional banking system given cryptocurrencies are not attached or depend on any government.”

However, citing the stablecoin share indicator, the JPMorgan analyst warned that the rallies seen in crypto markets may be coming to an end.

In February, JPMorgan predicted that the long-term price of bitcoin would reach $150,000. In January, the bank conducted a client survey and found that the majority of respondents expected the price of BTC to reach $60,000 or more this year.

Unlike JPMorgan, several people have said they see a significant upside to the crypto market. The CEO of Defiance ETFs said she remains “completely bullish on bitcoin,” expecting the price of the cryptocurrency to reach $100,000. In addition, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, outlined a number of bullish factors affecting crypto markets last week.

What do you think about JPMorgan’s assessment of the crypto market? Let us know in the comments section below.

Bitcoin is having a winning run as it rose over the $44,000-mark. Several other cryptocurrencies have made bigger gains.

This comes as members of Russia's national legislature have said that Moscow might accept Bitcoin for oil from countries with which it shares good terms.

BITCOIN, ETHEREUM PRICES

Bitcoin was trading 2.49 per cent up at $44,179. Ethereum was trading 2.87 per cent at $3,141.86.

OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES

XRP was up 0.49 per cent at $0.840829, Solana gained by 7.30 per cent at $104.46, Cardano was up by 4.99 per cent, Avalanche was up by 0.99 per cent.

Dogecoin was down by 0.27 per cent and Shiba Inu rose by 1.31 per cent.

""The global crypto market cap and trading volume rose by nearly 3 per cent and 7 per cent over the last day. Bitcoin and most other cryptos had a good day on Thursday. BTC and ETH gained 3 per cent each, trading above US$43,000 and US$3,000 levels,"" Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said.

""Several altcoins performed even better, including DOGE, Cardano, Solana, Algorand, Axie Infinity, etc. BTC’s dominance is currently at 41.82 per cent, while its resistance lies between US$46,000 and US$51,000. BTC can reverse the four-month-long downtrend if it crosses the lower resistance of US$46,000,"" Patel said.

2022-04-19 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptocurrency crash: Will crypto continue its price fall and what to do?	[]	"The fall of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that has been experiencing this 2022, especially in recent weeks, has generated fear among investors betting on digital tokens.

Just consider the drop of BTC in the last few hours, 3.12%, which so far this year amounts to 13.92%, while ETH has lost 2.59% of its value in the last few hours, while so far in 2022 it has lost 18.44%.

As expected, this negative effect has had consequences for other cryptocurrencies, such is the case of BNB, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Luna, and Avalanche, but the market drop does not seem to have reached its lowest point yet.

To what level could cryptocurrencies fall?

Due to its privileged position as the most valuable cryptocurrency in the market historically, Bitcoin's gains or losses are reflected in the rest of the digital tokens, which right now could be the worst possible news.

Crypto-investment experts do not rule out a drop from the average $40,000 level to the $30,000 level, a scenario that is alarming for all stakeholders in the subject.

""The signal for a break of the mild upward trend would be a consolidation below the $38,000 per bitcoin levels. If the bulls capitulate, the first cryptocurrency could be pushed into the $32,000 to $35,000 range without much resistance,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, told Forbes.

What to do if the price of cryptocurrencies continues to fall?

Although there is no ideal formula to follow in case the cryptocurrency decline continues, there are some things you can do, such as diversify your investment portfolio, invest in more established cryptocurrencies, be informed of recent trends, keep liquid savings, and use a crypto exchange with low fees and simple trades."

After a meteoric rise throughout the month of March, BTC saw a slight correction ahead of the Bitcoin 2022 conference geting underway in Miami.

The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is enjoying a rare moment of stability but could be boosted by any major positive news coming out of the world’s largest bitcoin conference.

Other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP), have all mirrored bitcoin’s movements, however dogecoin has seen big gains in recent days.

The crypto market calm could be about to come to an end, according to some analysts, who anticipate big moves from announcements coming out of Bitcoin 2022.

The Miami event is the same one that El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced last year that his country would be adopting BTC as a legal form of tender.

2022-03-10 00:00:00+00:00	Russia sanctions could drive more people to crypto, analysts say	['Radmilla Suleymanova']	"For investors, these are unprecedented times.

The world has been rocked by a deadly pandemic. Europe is at war; Russia in an economic chokehold. The United States is experiencing its highest inflation in 40 years and it’s likely to get worse. Currency and equity markets are gripped by a scale of volatility unseen in years. The status quo of the traditional geopolitical order faces a crisis. And commodities are trading like meme stocks.

Enter cryptocurrency – a $3 trillion market that promises to liberate people from the grip of the global financial system.

Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly mainstream. Five years ago, the market was valued at just $14bn – a fraction of what it is today.

The US government, among others, is trying to get in on the digital asset boom, seeking to regulate and reinvent a sector operating largely out of its reach.

US President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order requiring the government to assess the risks and benefits of creating its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).

While taking inspiration from cryptocurrencies and following some of the same principles, CBDCs are not regarded as crypto as they are regulated by a central authority. The White House will also look into mitigating crypto risks for consumers and leading economic and technological competitiveness and innovation in the sector.

China debuted its version of a CBDC, the digital yuan, during the Beijing Winter Olympic Games last month.

According to the Pew Research Center, 16 percent of Americans have dabbled in trading, using, and investing in cryptocurrencies. That figure is likely to rise considerably, crypto industry figures told Al Jazeera.

“I think we may refer to 2022 as the year of the big catalyst for crypto because what governments did is actually force adoption,” Ran Neuner, host of CNBC’s Crypto Trader, told Al Jazeera. “They put people in a position where they had no choice but to flee to the other system.”

‘What governments did’

The US and its allies have imposed sanctions on Russia over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

The world’s largest credit card networks, Visa and Mastercard, and internet payments giant PayPal announced over the weekend that they are suspending services in Russia. That means that credit and debit cards issued by Russian banks will no longer work outside of Russia. Russian businesses also will not be able to accept cards issued from outside the country.

“It’s the most ridiculous thing,” Neuner said. “Russians that are living in the US but have bank accounts in Russia have had their credit cards cut off. Essentially, people are forced onto the alternative financial system.”

Russians have also been barred from using SWIFT – an international bank messaging system vital for transactions. Russia’s central bank has had its assets seized and hundreds of companies in the tech, oil, media and consumer goods sectors have pulled their operations from the country. Last week, the rouble hit an all-time low.

If your participation in the global financial system is dependent on the appeasement of the US and its allies and if you’re not in good standing with those people, they kick you out of that system, maybe you’re going to look for a different global financial system to participate in.

Why Bitcoin is the most decentralised cryptocurrency

Bitcoin is the world’s most well-known fully decentralised cryptocurrency. The majority of the digital coin’s trading is done on a peer-to-peer basis. There is no middleman, unlike with banks, and transactions are recorded on a blockchain – a digital ledger maintained by a network of computers.

Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous for the anonymous person or entity that basically wrote the code. Nobody funded it, nobody invested in it –it’s open-source software. There was economic incentive for people to join the network to mine Bitcoin and over time, that incentive led to the creation of what Bitcoin enthusiasts consider the strongest computer network in the world.

To change something in the Bitcoin infrastructure, a proposal must first be submitted and then approved by many different players in the Bitcoin universe, including the people who mine the Bitcoin and the nodes – those who run the software.

This infrastructure is what makes Bitcoin resilient to nation-state attack and meddling.

‘The analogy here is Gmail versus email’

In addition to the decentralised Bitcoin network, there are centralised and decentralised trading platforms where one can buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin and thousands of other digital currencies and assets.

Centralised exchanges, which include platforms such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken that embrace government oversight, have recently come under pressure to ban all Russian users — not just sanctioned individuals — from their platforms.

Coinbase announced earlier this week that it had blocked 25,000 Russian-linked cryptocurrency addresses. The platform said the addresses were linked to Russian individuals or entities it believed to have engaged in illicit activity. Last week, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, reportedly removed Iranian users from its platform.

A truly decentralised network like Bitcoin protects users from this.

“The analogy here is Gmail versus email. Google could block certain addresses at the application level. But the smtp email protocol still works,” Ryan Selkis, founder of crypto research firm Messari, told Al Jazeera.

A Kraken spokesperson told Al Jazeera that freezing digital assets of citizens from an entire country does not necessarily punish those who are responsible for illicit activity.

“We hope a solution can be found that doesn’t cause serious and unnecessary harm to the individuals, families, and businesses who ultimately played no part in the decision to invade Ukraine,” the spokesperson said.

‘A potential future state’

Sanctions only work if people are using your currency. But if Russia and China decide they’re going to use Beijing’s digital central bank digital currency or Moscow decides to create its own, sanctions will no longer pack a punch.

In January, the US Federal Reserve said that its very own CBDC could be critical in maintaining the US dollar’s dominant global role. The central bank warned of “a potential future state” in which countries’ CBDCs could reduce the dollar’s global use and dominance.

China may have an opening in meeting the needs of Russia’s new economic reality.

In response to the Visa and Mastercard blockade, Sberbank and other Russian banks are reportedly considering using China’s credit card company UnionPay to issue cards.

China’s digital yuan could also become more mainstream.

“A digital yuan could allow the Chinese Communist Party to maintain control and surveillance over all domestic transactions, but include privacy protections that make the yuan more exportable as a reserve,” Selkis said."
2022-03-22 00:00:00+00:00	Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Crypto Stocks Are Soaring Today	['Anders Bylund']	"What happened

Many cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks posted sharp price gains on Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTC 1.64%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.69%) saw 24-hour gains of 3.9% and 3.2%, respectively, at 2 p.m. ET today. Leading cryptocurrency trading service Coinbase Global (COIN 14.92%) held a 7.2% price increase at the same point in time, while the crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital (SI 5.84%) was up 5.6%.

It's no surprise to see the biggest names in cryptocurrency jumping today, because they were fueled by a handful of bullish news items.

So what

First and foremost, cryptocurrencies took another meaningful step toward the mainstream economy. A leading government official asked the country of Malaysia to elevate cryptocurrencies into a form of legal tender.

Zahidi Zainul Abidin, Malaysia's deputy minister of communications and multimedia, addressed the country's parliament on Monday, asking legislators to accept Bitcoin and other digital coins in addition to the Malaysian ringgit. The government started kicking the tires of a state-backed cryptocurrency in January, but Abidin's request could broaden that review into raising the legal status of many existing cryptocurrencies.

Malaysia could become the second nation to take this step, following El Salvador's policy of accepting Bitcoin payments in addition to the U.S. dollar. Malaysia has a larger population and economy than El Salvador. Hence, whatever happens in Malaysia is more likely to move the needle for Bitcoin and other crypto names in the long term. That being said, Malaysia's cryptocurrency review is still in its early stages, while El Salvador already took the Bitcoin leap.

Furthermore, Malaysia is working with the governments of Australia, Singapore, and South Africa to set up an international payment system involving digital assets issued by each country's central bank. The panel considering this idea issued a report on Tuesday morning, saying that a prototype platform for border-crossing digital payments is ""technically viable."" Similar reviews are also taking place in important markets such as Switzerland and Hong Kong.

Ethereum rode along on Bitcoin's gains to some degree. At the same time, the smart-contract platform continued to burn tokens as it moves closer to a long-awaited technical upgrade. The next-generation Ethereum system will be faster and leaner, moving from the power-hungry proof-of-work architecture to the environmentally friendly proof-of-stake alternative, and the inflationary creation of new Ether tokens will drop by 90%. Several popular media outlets picked up on Ethereum's progress on Monday afternoon, throwing fuel on the digital currency's fires.

When Bitcoin and Ethereum are up, Silvergate and Coinbase are sure to follow. That's not always the correct market reaction, since both companies are more interested in cryptocurrencies seeing high trading volumes than high coin prices, but that's life on Wall Street. The reasons behind each price move might not always make sense in the short run, though the market tends to be a very fair system of value assessments in the long run.

Now what

Tuesday's respectable price surge will not completely make up for the crypto market's weakness in recent months -- not by a long shot. Every security and digital coin mentioned above is still down by 27% or more since the slide began in mid-November. By comparison, the S&P 500 market index has lost only 3% of its value over the same period:

In other words, prices are still low, and long-term cryptocurrency bulls should see a solid buying opportunity in this long-lived market dip. You won't even remember the single-digit gains you missed on Tuesday in the context of much greater gains in the long run."

Thailand has relaxed tax rules for crypto trading until the end of 2023 to boost the crypto economy.

Bitcoin and Crypto Market News

The crypto assets market extended a global slump for the second consecutive day after Bitcoin got rejected near the $42,500 region yesterday. Sellers swarmed the markets as sentiment worsened post the release of US inflation data which is at a record 7.9%, the largest increase in 40 years. Market sell off almost confirmed the US Federal reserve’s decision to hike the interest rates will be imminent next week and the European Central Bank started slowing down the stimulus program too. The crypto assets market capitalization currently stands at $1.7 trillion with a 24 hour decline of 2.2%. In this article, we will briefly cover the top stories that occurred in the crypto ecosystem.

Meme coins are back in fashion

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are currently ranked in the top 20 crypto assets by market cap list with its price action primarily driven by strong communities. Also known as Meme coins, they have garnered the attention of the world leaders and companies who are looking to capitalize on the adoption wave. In that order, AMC, one of the largest movie theater chains in the US, has officially started to accept DOGE and SHIB as online payments through their website. The announcement came from the CEO of AMC on Twitter crediting crypto payments processor Bitpay for making it a reality.

With Turkish Lira tanking in value over the past several years, the citizens of Turkey have turned to crypto to hedge against inflation and volatility. Though Bitcoin and Tether (USDT) are the most traded on domestic exchanges, the Turks have taken a particular liking to trade Shiba Inu. Taking a step further, Turkey's finance minister met with a Turkish Shiba Inu influencer to discuss widespread adoption of the meme crypto.

Dubai & Thailand welcome crypto

Dubai passed a virtual assets law creating a legal framework for crypto assets in the emirate of Dubai and established Dubai Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). The VARA aims to protect investors, ensure transparency and design international standards for governance. The new crypto law will require Dubai residents to register with VARA prior to engaging in crypto-related activities. Businesses dealing in virtual asset activities must also establish a presence in Dubai. These activities include operating a crypto exchange, conducting transfers of cryptocurrencies, and other services related to offering and trading tokens.

Thailand, in an effort to boost the crypto economy, has relaxed tax rules for crypto trading until the end of 2023. Starting April 1, trades of digital assets on government-approved exchanges will be exempt from a 7% value-added-tax (VAT). Transfers involving Thailand's retail central bank digital currency will also be exempt from the VAT over the same time period. Traders will also be able to deduct losses from crypto trading from taxes due on gains.

Behance and Polygon

Adobe’s Behance creative social media platform is adding support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on Polygon, allowing creators to display their work. Creators can connect their Web3 wallet like Metamask to their Behance profile, and any NFTs they have created will be displayed on their Behance profile. This integration with Polygon is powered by blockchain development platform Alchemy. Reduced carbon footprint and low fees have made Polygon one of the main destinations for the NFT community.

2022-02-28 05:00:44.259000+00:00	Borderless crypto markets show need for global rules	['Laura Noonan']	"More than 500 years elapsed between the founding of the world’s first bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, and the creation of the first set of global banking standards: the 1988 Basel accord.

By that benchmark, global policymakers are ahead of the curve in devising standards for cryptocurrencies, which emerged just 13 years ago with Bitcoin’s January 2009 debut. Forums such as the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and the securities regulator Iosco are already discussing global standards for crypto.

But this year has brought new urgency to those talks, as crypto markets’ explosive growth, coupled with their increasing links to the regulated sector and the currencies’ widespread adoption by individuals, have prompted the FSB to warn that stability risks could “escalate rapidly”.

“Anything that is growing and not regulated can cause enormous problems if we don’t get to grips with it,” warned Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s commissioner for financial services, at an FT event on February 17. She described how young people are now investing in crypto as a “pastime” and taking financial advice from the video sharing platform TikTok.

Anything that is growing and not regulated can cause enormous problems if we don’t get to grips with it

“The collective activities are alarming if they’re not regulated, and this is why there is a global need for principles around the whole crypto space,” she stressed.

The borderless nature of cryptocurrency trading companies, whose decentralised businesses can be scattered across physical territories and servers, further underscores the need for a global approach to policing them.

“There are cryptocurrency businesses that appear to be everywhere and yet physically are nowhere at all,” said Mark Steward, head of enforcement and markets oversight at the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, at the same February 17 event. “That’s a real red flag for everyone and it’s something that should concern regulators all over the world.”

Halfway around the world from the FCA, Ashley Alder — head of Hong Kong’s Securities & Futures Commission and chair of global securities regulator, Iosco — sees co-ordination between the various domestic and international regulators as “of paramount importance”. He says he wants to “explore a holistic and integrated approach to virtual asset activities, and to reduce regulatory arbitrage”, ie any variation in rules between territories.

However, while policymakers in major financial centres agree on the need for global standards, Benoît Coeuré, the then head of the Bank for International Settlements innovation hub, warned in December of the risk that jurisdictions pursue “different tracks and produce a system which is globally inconsistent”.

The EU has already set out its proposed regional principles in the Markets in Crypto Asset (Mica) directive. This was presented to the European parliament in October 2020 and is expected to come into force around 2024 — covering everything from the custody of digital assets to sales and trading of them, offering advice, and exchanging them for hard currency.

Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Alder says his agency has been “pragmatically and creatively applying its existing powers” so that it can regulate crypto as it would regulate other securities. Or, as he puts it: “On the basis of a ‘same business, same risks, same rules’ approach.”

More formal rules are coming. Hong Kong is now developing legislation that will make sure that all crypto assets are captured by the same regulation “regardless of whether crypto assets traded on these platforms fall within the traditional definition of ‘securities’.”

Neighbouring China has taken a more absolute approach. In September, the authorities declared all crypto activities “illegal” and vowed to investigate Chinese nationals working for foreign crypto exchanges.

Singapore has instead brought crypto into its anti-money laundering regime. According to a spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, regulators are “ready to adapt our rules as needed to manage the policy balance” between supporting innovation and managing risks.

In the US, Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler has been pushing for Congress to give his agency — and others, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — powers to deliver “more robust oversight and investor protection” in the large parts of the crypto market that are “sitting astride” the regulatory framework. He has warned that these are “rife with fraud, scams and abuse”.

The CFTC has also warned of the dangers of “regulating through enforcement” and called on Congress to frame clearer rules for what’s legal and what’s not.

In the UK, the FCA has begun registering cryptocurrency companies for compliance with anti-money laundering rules and has warned of a crackdown on advertisements once crypto comes into the FCA’s financial promotions regime. “Legislation is needed more broadly here,” Steward said at the recent FT event.

In addition to these national regulatory moves, all the major territories say they are mindful of global developments and participating in international discussions. One official points out that the EU’s Mica directive was designed to implement international recommendations where they existed, including the work that the FSB had done around stablecoins — a type of cryptocurrency whose value is backed by real assets, such as traditional currencies, gold or short term bonds.

Still, that does not mean differences in regulatory treatment will not creep in — even among regimes with a shared aim of protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. For this reason, crypto regulation has now shot up the agenda of the FSB.

Klaas Knot, the FSB’s chair, says: “The FSB would be naturally positioned to take that lead. We have the convening power . . . we bring together the central banks, the finance ministries, which represent the ultimate legislators, the supervisory agencies, both banking, insurance, securities and some international organisations. They’re all at the FSB table.”

Knot expects that the FSB’s work on global crypto standards could progress “quite a bit in 2022”. The next step would be publishing those standards and having them swiftly implemented by the 24 member countries of the FSB — and others beyond.

Everyone is hoping that swift action can ensure crypto’s fate is less ignominious than that of Monte dei Paschi: once famous as the world’s oldest bank, now best known as the institution brought closest to collapse by the eurozone’s financial crisis.

Factors contributing to the recent turbulence include the Fed’s plans to increase rates aggressively. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s 9.2 % acquisition of Twitter fueled a surge in Dogecoin prices.

Global Crypto Market Scenario

The worldwide market capitalization for crypto currently stands at $1.94 trillion, a 1.95% drop from the previous day. However, there has been a significant increase (32.68%) in trading activity during this timeframe. Current market statistics also reveal DeFi’s 13.27% stake in the 24-hour volume at USD 9.60 Billion. Stablecoins enjoy an 82.28% majority stake in the 24-hour crypto market volume at $59.52 billion.

Bitcoin

The world’s first cryptocurrency is currently having a market dominance of 41.37%, a 0.36% intra-day increase. Bitcoin is currently valued at $42051.12, an 8.74% drop over the week. Current market capitalization stands at $802.27 billion with a daily trade of $22 Billion. Throughout the year, BTC is hovering between the $35k to $45k mark and recorded a breakout of $48k the previous month reaching its year-to-date high.

Ethereum

Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum also dropped by 10% from its previous week’s valuations. The current price stands at $3139.73 with a 24-hour trading volume of $13.23 billion. The token behind the world’s most widely-used blockchain declined 3.01% from its previous closing and has a current market capitalization of US$380.49 billion. Reports indicate that ETH will unleash its upgrade for PoW to PoS within this year.

DOGECOIN

The meme-centric cryptocurrency displayed strong growth fuelled by patron Elon Musk’s acquisition of the largest individual stake in social media platform Twitter. Within 24 hour volumes standing at $1.82 billion and a market cap of $19.34 billion, Dogecoin stands 1.27% higher than its previous week’s current price stands at $0.1457, an approximate 2.97% decrease front the previous day’s prices.

Other news:

Other cryptocurrencies also rallied downwards. Digital assets like XRP fell 14.68%, Polygon(MATIC) slipped over 17%, while Avalanche(AVA), Polkafot(DOT), Solana(SOL), and Cardano(ADA) all fell over 20% over a week. Cardano along with the University of Zurich will increase its academic research projects on blockchain and DLT. Nera Protocol, a growing competitor of Ethereum, recently raised $350 million boosted by growing global interest in Blockchain, decentralization, and Web 3.0.

Intel Corporation unveiled its Intel Blocksale ASIC- a 2nd generation mining processor for Bitcoins with a hash rate of 580 GH/S and energy-efficient power consumption of just 26J/TH. Meta has recently shelved the Diem stablecoin development project, and currently focusing on its metaverse tokens.

Wrapping Up

Crypto markets are recently facing a downward slump with tokens undergoing rectification. However, progress is consistent on a global level across blockchain and crypto communities."

This has prompted economic organizations and experts to see digital assets as a more robust market than traditional asset classes, most notably stocks.

Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist at the Bank of America (BofA), commented on the current decline of the macro-economic situation in a weekly research note to the organization’s clients, as Reuters reported on April 8.

In the note, he warned that the deterioration could lead to a recession shock in the United States, as the Federal Reserve struggles to cool the four-decade high inflation by tightening its policies, and investors expect a 50 basis point hike in the key interest rate.

As Hartnett simply explained it:

“’Inflation shock’ worsening, ‘rates shock’ just beginning, ‘recession shock’ coming.”

Hartnett added that, in such a context, cash, volatility, commodities and cryptocurrencies could outperform bonds and stocks.

Others’ views on the resilience of crypto

It’s worth noting that BofA’s chief investment strategist is far from being alone in the belief that crypto could outperform other markets.

As Finbold earlier reported, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist holds similar views. Specifically, Mike McGlone has said that cryptocurrencies were coming out ahead in the ‘ebbing tide’ of inflation that all central banks in the Western countries were facing.

He also reiterated his position of their ‘divergent strength’ primarily versus the stock market, in the context of the currently developing financial situation during which Nasdaq is down about eight percent on the year, while Bitcoin (BTC) remains almost unchanged.

Earlier, Mr. McGlone also expressed his belief that “Bitcoin may be maturing toward global digital collateral,” and that it was poised to triumph given the fact that its losses in 2020 were less than half of those of Nasdaq 100’s.

Meanwhile, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is at the $2 trillion level, even as it struggles to remain above it, crossing it for the first time this year in late March, as reported by Finbold."
2022-04-19 15:05:27.564000+00:00	Cryptocurrencies Affected by Inflation, Taxes, and Market Trends	['Nathan Reiff', 'Nathan Reiff Has Been Writing Expert Articles', 'News About Financial Topics Such As Investing', 'Trading', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Etfs', 'Alternative Investments On Investopedia Since', 'Learn About Our', 'Editorial Policies']	"Top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB may be more susceptible to external market factors than some crypto enthusiasts would like to believe. These and other major tokens fell sharply in the first two weeks of April 2022, with the broader crypto market losing almost $400 billion of value during that time. What's worse, analysts say that a ""disaster"" in the financial markets could send crypto prices plunging even further.

While Bitcoin has moved above and below a price threshold of $40,000 throughout most of 2022, the latest price drop is a reminder to investors that decentralized digital tokens may still react strongly to factors such as inflation, taxes, and overall market performance.

Key Takeaways Cryptocurrencies plunged in the first part of April 2022, dropping about $400 billion in value in the first two weeks or so.

Although cryptocurrencies are purported to operate independently of many external market influences, recent trends suggest that this may not be entirely true.

Investors should look to factors such as inflation, Federal Reserve policy, and tax season for potential links with cryptocurrency performance.

External Factors Suggest Influence on Crypto Prices

The most recent cryptocurrency sell-off has coincided with a decline in U.S. stock market futures. These declines may be attributable to news that March marked an 8.5% year-over-year (YOY) increase in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation remains a significant concern, and with it the possibility of a recession in the near to medium term. Investors viewing cryptocurrencies as a strong alternative investment during times of market turbulence should watch carefully to see how cryptocurrency prices move as the Federal Reserve works to curb inflation.

Tax Season Impact?

The recent slump in cryptocurrency price levels may also be due in part to tax season. In a majority of recent tax seasons, from January through March, Bitcoin has fallen. While this could be a coincidence, some analysts suspect that Bitcoin tends to underperform in the first months of the year relative to other months because investors who realized major gains in crypto assets during the previous year tend to sell some of their holdings to cover anticipated tax liabilities. This is complicated by the disparate ways that jurisdictions treat capital gains.

Federal Reserve Policies

As analysts expect the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates and borrowing costs, investors in the crypto space may want to watch for signs that economic demand is suffering. This may be felt most prominently in traditionally riskier areas like cryptocurrency. Rising bond yields could also minimize excess return that investors could achieve from cryptocurrencies relative to safer bets like bonds. Combined with persistent inflation and other large-scale economic concerns, this shift may cause investors to turn away from cryptocurrencies to safer alternatives. This could be reflected in the price level of digital tokens for those who continue to trade in this space."

Link copied to

clipboard

While the US dollar index (DXY) and stonks seem indecisive on Wall Street today, Bitcoin and crypto are pretty steady at the time of writing.

Meanwhile the crypto Fear & Greed Index has ticked up a bit over the past few days and the generally more bullish analysts around are sounding, unsurprisingly, generally bullish for the short term.

However, one prominent analyst better known as a traditional finance observer has provided some words of caution today. Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone was speaking on the Wolf of All Streets Podcast on Monday and was pointing to an over “extended” stock market that could keep all risk assets suppressed.

“So, we have the most extended stock market in 20 years relatively… most expensive stock market in terms of GDP in the history of mankind, most expensive stock market versus real estate and versus global equities ever… and part of that is that’s been driving inflation and the Fed has to push back that inflation,” said McGlone.

Lose-lose for risk assets? Unfortunately, at current levels of inflation, the #FederalReserve, by mandate, basically has to limit peoples ability to buy stuff.https://t.co/cBmj94luGs — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) March 21, 2022

“That was my warning — people that don’t get it yet — ‘Don’t buy the dip’ — that’s for the people that haven’t learned their lessons,” the Bloomberg analyst continued.

Long-term, though, McGlone still believes Bitcoin, specifically, will eventually hit US$100k. Whether or not that’s this year as he’s previously indicated it could, is another question. McGlone also thinks that BTC “might easily see US$30,000 first”.

Top 10 overview

With the overall crypto market cap at about US$1.96 trillion, up roughly 0.7% from this time yesterday, here’s the current state of play among top 10 tokens – according to CoinGecko.

Layer 1s Terra (LUNA), Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are leading the top-10 price action over the past 24 hours, although Avalanche (AVAX) has been surging again lately, too. In the first week of March, according to data from Staking Rewards, LUNA flipped ETH in terms of staked value, and as you can see on the chart below, it’s maintained that placing with more than US$29.8 billion worth of LUNA locked up for passive rewards. Solana (SOL) isn’t doing too badly with that metric, either.

As for how Bitcoin (BTC) is shaping up so far this week, feelings are as mixed as ever among the Twitter-populated crypto analysts. It’s tricky to get a read on who’s the more vocal right now – bears or bulls.

@ZeroHedge, aka “John Wick”, seems to be sensing something big just around the corner, though…

#BTC This resistance has been touched 4 times. The more times a resistance is touched the more powerful the breakout eventually is.

Monson, a 44-year-old commercial writer and mother who recently moved to Hawaii, found the news disturbing.

“I was like, oh my God, we are all going to be dragged into this creepy metaverse by Mark Zuckerberg, whether we like it or not, and have no say in it,” she said during an interview last week at NFT LA, a cryptocurrency conference in downtown Los Angeles.

Monson thought her 6-year-old daughter would encounter some version of the metaverse in the future and she wanted to be prepared. She decided the best thing to do was learn about the technologies that many proponents of the metaverse said would underpin it, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, or nonfungible tokens.

“My whole point was, I want to educate myself,” Monson said. She also didn’t want to miss out on what was looking to her like another major tech boom. “I lived in Seattle during the dot com bubble and I had no voice or power to do anything,” she said.

Monson first began investing in crypto several years ago. But she spent the past five months diving into the market headfirst, listening to NFT podcasts, joining Discord servers, and connecting with other mothers on Twitter. She is now getting ready to launch her first NFT art collection, which she dubbed The Latchkey Kids, a reference to members of her generation born in the 1970s and ’80s. On the second day of NFT LA, she wore a face mask and T-shirt printed with the colorful cartoon goats she helped design for the project.

While younger, male Americans are more likely to say they have heard a lot about cryptocurrencies, a small but growing number of mothers, like Monson, are getting into the industry. For them, the stakes of investing in crypto can be higher. Most of the six mothers interviewed for this article said that they hoped crypto and NFTs would meaningfully change the financial security of their families for generations to come. They said they felt their perspective was different from that of the “crypto bros” often associated with the market.

“With more and more parents entering this space, we have a different mindset,” said Olayinka Odeniran, the founder of the Black Women Blockchain Council, an organization that supports Black women pursuing careers in the blockchain and fintech industries, who has a 12-year-old daughter. “Our approach is different from the single guys or girls who are solely here just to invest. We’re here really because we want to leave something for our family and we want them to be able to participate in our space.”

Odeniran and other mothers like her represent a minority of the crypto industry. Only 13 percent of American women in their 30s and 40s say they have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrencies, compared to 43 percent of men in their late teens and 20s, according to a Pew Research Center study published in November. Overall, twice as many men invest in crypto as women, a CNBC survey found.

The lack of women is so pronounced that it is often the subject of jokes. During the conference Monson attended, comedian Kristin Key mused on stage that perhaps NFT stood for “no females today.” (The audience didn’t laugh.)

But now, amid another bull market, a new wave of female-themed organizations have emerged that say they want to encourage more women to participate in crypto.

Deana Burke, a mother of two kids under age 5 and the co-founder of Boys Club, a crypto collective designed for women and nonbinary people, said there is more excitement about entering the industry among women than when she first joined a few years ago.

“I couldn’t get anyone to care,” said Burke. “But there’s now this ambient curiosity.”

Maternal branding

One of the most well-known “Crypto Moms” is Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Pierce. She was given the nickname by members of the crypto community, who often view her as an ally for their industry. Pierce said she mostly doesn’t mind being called a mother, even though she doesn’t actually have any biological children. But she also thinks her role shouldn’t be thought of as a parental one.

“I think it’s somewhat bad for a government official to be viewed in parental terms, because my philosophy for regulation is, look, this country is built on liberty and people making their own decisions,” she said. “I am certainly old enough to be a lot of these crypto people’s mothers, so from that perspective, it’s not too crazy either.”

Pierce isn’t the only person being referred to as a crypto mother. Brenda Gentry, a full-time crypto trader based in San Antonio, has branded herself online as “MsCryptoMom.” Her tagline: “Mother knows best.”

Gentry, 46, grew up in Kenya and previously worked as a mortgage underwriter for USAA, a financial services firm for members and veterans of the U.S. military. She quit in October, after she and her husband calculated that their retirement accounts would be worth around $400,000 or $500,000 if they continued working for the next 20 years, around the same amount Gentry said she had already made through crypto trading. Gentry said she is excited about the financial opportunities presented by crypto, but also aware of the risks involved.

“Sometimes, I see these young kids on Twitter saying, ‘I made so much on this NFT and I’m leaving my job,’ and I’m like, what?” Gentry said. “They forget that we have bad markets. You know, you got to think about that, too.”

Gentry said she protects herself by only investing in crypto projects that disclose the real names of the people behind them. She believes investment opportunities in the space are more likely to be scams if they are run by anonymous founders.

“I would not invest money if I don’t know who the team is. If I don’t know, if they are anonymous, I walk away. The only one that is anonymous is Satoshi,” Gentry said, referring to the creator of bitcoin, whose true identity remains unknown.

Seeking opportunities

Brenda Cataldo, a realtor and mother of five living in Palm Bay, Florida, said she sees crypto as a rare chance to build wealth for her family and greater community.

“If I’m able to make money, I’m able to help everybody else around me. I don’t think that’s a bad thing,” she said. “If you don’t take care of yourself, how can you take care of anyone else?”

Cataldo has invested in cryptocurrencies for a few years. But she began learning about NFTs on TikTok last fall. She is now getting ready to launch her own NFT collection called Luxe Ladies, which was modeled after her mother, who immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines. She said 20 percent of the proceeds will go toward supporting foster children.

“I just think how lucky and blessed I was to have a mom that was such an advocate for me,” she said. “I want to give a little back to kids who don’t have that.”

Other mothers interviewed also said they view crypto as an avenue to raise money for charitable causes. Gentry said she and her husband have run a nonprofit supporting poor families in her native Kenya for years, but the extra money from trading cryptocurrencies has made a major difference.

“When my parents went back to Kenya in January, instead of helping the 20 or 30 people that we usually do, they could help 200 people,” she said. “So it’s not just generational wealth for my grandkids, my children’s kids that they haven’t even had yet, but it’s also for other other families.”

But Shailee Adinolfi, a mother and the director of strategic sales and accounts at the blockchain software company Consensys, warned that it’s currently not necessarily easy for people to transfer the money they earn from cryptocurrencies to their families or other organizations.

“What if you want to pass crypto down to your kids? There aren’t shared accounts,” she said. “We need to think about all kinds of people and how they interact with systems and not just develop them for the same group of people that are usually coding.”

Climate fears

Monson said she wants to convince more mothers like her to get involved with NFT art collections. But she said many of them worry about the environmental impact of bitcoin and how much electricity it uses.

Burke noted that there are a number of newer blockchain technologies already in use that are designed to consume fewer resources. She said there are plenty of people in crypto who want to address the harm being done to the environment, rather than contribute to it.

“The world that I’m part of in web3 and crypto is very, very, very climate-conscious and is actively working towards improving the situation,” she said.

Monson said she hopes that the industry will continue to evolve. For now, she plans to keep exploring what the crypto world could mean for her and her family’s future.

“I love my job and I love what I do, but I’m more than just a mom, and I feel like so many other moms, we need more,” she said. “This is a thrilling new life change.”"
2022-03-04 23:00:00+00:00	How Is Bitcoin’s Price Affected By The News?	['Mike Ermolaev']	"The price of any asset is always impacted by a combination of factors. Unlike traditional financial assets, bitcoin has historically had its own set of factors affecting its price. Do things look any different now? Let's find out.

Basic Factors: Supply And Demand

Bitcoin’s price is heavily dependent on supply and demand fluctuations, just like other assets. However, contrary to measures of fiat money, bitcoin’s supply is always known and its hard cap is set at 21 million coins.

The demand for bitcoin always sits at the top of the cryptocurrency world’s agenda — that’s why adoption of BTC is so talked about. Higher demand will lead to an increase in its price, especially when institutional investors get involved.

For example, when companies and institutions began buying and holding bitcoin in early 2021, its price rose significantly as demand outpaced the rate at which new coins were being placed on the market for sale, resulting in a decrease in the total available supply of the cryptocurrency.

Its price will drop, however, if there are more people who want to sell it.

Institutional Adoption

News influences investor perception about Bitcoin in a major way.

In spite of extreme volatility in bitcoin’s price, the year 2021 stands out for its unprecedented adoption by both institutions and corporations.

For example, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust had an average AUM of $31 billion and an average Bitcoin holding of 650K in 2021.

Crypto Regulation

Bitcoin’s price is also affected by regulatory developments. Changes in regulation can encourage or discourage investment in BTC or in its use, which in turn leads to an increase or decrease in its price.

Here's how the bitcoin price overlaid with regulatory events in 2021 looks:

News Indirectly Related To Bitcoin

Let’s consider an example of how indirect news events, such as reports about a political situation in a country somewhere in the world, can substantially impact the price of BTC.

On 2 January, 2022, a week-long uprising started in Kazakhstan. Most people hadn’t realized the significance of this event for the crypto market. In recent years, Kazakhstan became the world’s number two bitcoin miner based on hash rate. It accounts for about 18% of the global hash rate, and is only outdone by the United States.

So, with the news of an uprising, it took about 24 hours for the crypto market to react, and the BTC price plunged a combined 13.1% from January 2 to January 8.

BTC Increasingly Resembles Traditional Assets

In theory, traditional market-related news such as reports on the macroeconomic environment or monetary policy decisions of central banks should not affect cryptocurrencies owing to their decentralized nature. However, the current trend suggests otherwise.

Global news sentiment has a big impact on equity returns around the world, according to World Bank research. This effect is not reversible in the short run, suggesting an underlying source of sentiment-driven asset price fluctuations.

Below is the Daily News Sentiment Index by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which gives an overall measure of economic sentiment by analyzing news articles:

Although Bitcoin is not a traditional asset, it appears that the general news sentiment influences its value.

Here’s what bitcoin’s price chart looks like when combined with the news sentiment index for the same period:

Recent data on Bitcoin and major stock indices correlation also suggests this.

Historically, crypto assets didn’t show a strong correlation with major stock indices. In the latest Coinmetrics data, however, the daily correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 jumped to 0.47 on January 28, 2022, indicating a close correlation.

Bottom Line

As the crypto market matures, new trends are emerging that we haven’t observed before. Initially a fringe asset, bitcoin is now increasingly acting like a traditional asset, sensitive to the same market forces that affect those markets. In addition to news on crypto regulations and institutional adoption, bitcoin’s price is affected by changes in general economic conditions and world events that impact traditional markets.

An Investor', 'Market Watcher Since The', 'He Received An Ab In Economics Harvard College', 'An Mba In Finance The Wharton School Of The University Of Pennsylvania', 'Authored The Book Career Confidential', 'An Insider S Guide To Business.']	"Platforms for cryptocurrency trading and lending should be registered and regulated like traditional securities exchanges, argues U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. On April 4, 2022, he announced that SEC staff is working on this during his keynote address to a conference on digital assets, cryptocurrency, and blockchain held by the University of Pennsylvania Carey School of Law.

Gensler observed that many tokens trading on these platforms meet the definition of ""securities."" He also remarked that these crypto platforms play roles similar to traditional regulated exchanges. Thus, he believes that investors should be protected in the same way.

Key Takeaways The SEC is working on having crypto platforms regulated like traditional securities exchanges.

Some digital assets meet traditional tests applied to investment contracts and securities.

Crypto trading and lending is highly concentrated in just a few platforms.

'We Should Be Technology-Neutral'

Gensler said: ""The SEC's remit is overseeing the capital markets and our three-part mission: protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets ... regulators also care about guarding against illicit activity ... There's no reason to treat the crypto market differently just because different technology is used. We should be technology-neutral.""

Highly Concentrated Market

Gensler stated that the crypto market is worth about $2 trillion, with daily trading volume of more than $100 billion. He also stated that, among crypto-only exchanges, the top five platforms account for 99% of all trading, and just two platforms make up 80%. In crypto-to-fiat transactions, 80% of trading is on five platforms. Regarding trading on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, the top five account for almost 80% of total trading.

'These Platforms Likely Are Trading Securities'

Gensler noted that a typical trading platform has dozens of tokens on it, and many have more than 100 tokens. Moreover, he believes that many of these tokens may meet the definition of ""securities."" Specifically, he stated that most crypto tokens involve a group of entrepreneurs raising money from the public in anticipation of profits, which is exactly what traditional investment contracts or securities under SEC jurisdiction do.

He cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1946 Howey Test (actually about orange groves), which asserts that an investment contract exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. Gensler believes that most crypto tokens are investment contracts under the Howey Test, and thus he wants crypto tokens treated as securities to be registered with the SEC.



'Stablecoins Raise Three Sets of Policy Issues'

Gensler observed that stablecoins, a $183 billion and growing market, are generally used strictly on crypto platforms, and rarely for commerce. He said that they potentially may compete with bank deposits and money market funds, and they raise three important sets of policy issues.

The first is public policy considerations around financial stability and monetary policy. The second is how they can be used for illicit activity. The third is investor protection issues.

Regarding investor protection, he noted that stablecoins are mainly used on crypto platforms, where they are involved in about 80% to 85% of their trading and lending activity. Moreover, these tokens actually are often owned by the platforms, giving their customers a counterparty relationship. Noting that U.S. retail investors have no direct right of redemption for the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization, Gensler finds conflicts of interest and market integrity questions that warrant more oversight."

The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday that John and JonAtina Barksdale used in-person roadshows around the world and social media including YouTube videos to sell fraudulent investments related to the so-called Ormeus Coin. The SEC said they falsely claimed that the digital coin was supported by one of the largest crypto mining operations in the world — after making less than $3 million in mining revenue and abandoning their mining operations in 2019.

The SEC suit filed in federal court in Manhattan accuses the siblings of violating federal securities laws and seeks unspecified civil penalties and restitution.

In addition, federal prosecutors in Manhattan announced Tuesday that John Barksdale has been arrested and charged with criminal securities fraud.

John and JonAtina Barksdale couldn’t be located for comment; the SEC said it wasn’t known whether they were represented by attorneys.

The SEC has warned investors to be wary of potential investment scams involving cryptocurrencies and of investing based on social media.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said last year that investors need more protection in the cryptocurrency market, which he called “rife with fraud, scams and abuse.”

Digital currencies such as bitcoin have been left largely unregulated by major governments. The SEC has brought and won dozens of fraud cases against cryptocurrency promoters, but Gensler said the agency needs greater authority from Congress, and more resources, to regulate the crypto markets.

The Biden administration has asked Congress for legislation to expand government regulation of stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a specific value, usually the dollar or another currency, or gold."

Cryptocurrencies are a form of virtual or digital currency that is secured using cryptography. This means that they are incredibly secure and are near impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.

Various encryption algorithms and other cryptographic techniques are usually involved in any cryptocurrency you care to look at that serve the purpose of safeguarding the networks from outside manipulation. Which cryptographic methods are used does vary, but can include things like curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.

After an unprecedented run-up, venture funding to Latin American startups fell in the first quarter of this year.

Overall, investors put $3.4 billion into funding rounds in Q1 of 2022—down 30 percent from Q4 2021. Round counts also fell, with later-stage posting the sharpest drop at just 15 reported rounds, down from 35 in Q4.

Nonetheless, by historical standards, the Latin American startup scene is still running hot. Even with the quarter-over-quarter decline, total investment for Q1 is 28 percent higher than the year-ago quarter. For perspective, we lay out funding totals for the past five quarters below:

Late stage fell

What to make of the numbers? Well, first off, it should be emphasized that we are coming off record highs.

Latin America ranked as the fastest-growing region in the world for venture funding in 2021. Over the course of the year, venture and technology-growth investors poured an estimated $19.5 billion into the region, per Crunchbase data. That’s more than triple prior year levels, which were themselves record-setting.

Most of the rising investment went to late-stage rounds, with valuations rising in tandem. Brazil and Mexico alone count 25 unicorns between them, per Crunchbase data, and the region’s population of ultra-high valuation populations grew briskly between 2020 and 2021.

For a broader view, we look at late-stage round counts and investment totals over five quarters below:

To see a Q1 late-stage contraction in Latin America isn’t entirely surprising. Globally, later-stage investment has been on the decline, with Q1 totals down from Q4 highs, and the number of newly minted unicorns lower.

A large portion of Latin America’s late-stage investment comes from firms headquartered overseas. And the region is not insulated from factors impacting other markets, including a weak IPO environment and heightened pressure on lofty private valuations.

Still, we did see some big rounds at late stage in Q1, including a $300 million Series D for Brazil-based digital bank Neon, and a $260 million Series F for Brazilian consumer loan provider Creditas.

Seed stage grew

While the unicorn scene has cooled some this year, funding at the very earliest stages remains quite robust.

Seed and angel investment held up at around $300 million in Q1—roughly on par with the prior two quarters. For context, we look at reported round counts and investment totals for the past five quarters below:

The numbers match how Wenyi Cai, founder and CEO of Colombia-based startup backer Polymath Ventures, describes the funding scene for the very earliest-stage startups. While unicorn valuation inflation may be a worry at the late stage, seed dealmakers still are busy as ever.

“At pre-seed, seed and Series A, where we’re more familiar, I would say there’s still a lot of strength in the market,” Cai said in an interview. She’s bullish on growth prospects across a range of sectors, including e-commerce logistics, fintech infrastructure and social commerce.

In particular, Cai and other seed-stage investors continue to see tremendous opportunity building services for Latin America’s large and underserved middle class. Mobile-centric platforms are top of mind in the consumer space, with startups scaling up in areas ranging from retail to real estate to fintech.

Early stage

Early-stage (Series A and B) funding totals were also down in Q1 relative to the prior three quarters. However, the $1.3 billion invested in the first quarter of 2022 is still 160 percent above the year-ago total, so the notion of decline is somewhat relative.

We map out the ups and downs over the past five quarters below:

While a typical early-stage deal is around $15 million, there were a few examples of much bigger rounds in Q1.

The largest was a $181 million Series B for Colombia-based Tul, a provider of a mobile app that lets users buy hardware and construction products from local merchants. That deal, Cai said, is exemplary of a broader hot trend in venture funding focused on platforms that serve small and independent Latin American businesses.

The next-largest round was a $112 million Series B for Solides, a Brazilian developer of human resources software aimed at increasing productivity and reducing turnover costs.

The road ahead

Overall, the latest numbers out of Latin America probably won’t turn the region’s startup bulls into bears, or vice versa.

Investment totals don’t go up every single quarter, so seeing some pullback isn’t necessarily alarming, particularly when one considers how quickly and dramatically funding scaled up. Seed also looks healthy, indicating there’s continuing appetite to back promising entrepreneurs at the riskiest stage of startup development.

However, as Cai observes, the unicorn herd is likely to see some culling. While those with a history of operating lean should do OK, she says, other high-valuation startups will need to pare back costs to make it through what looks like a tougher late-stage fundraising environment.

Methodology

The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 4, 2022.

Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.

Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.

Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

Glossary of funding terms

Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.Early stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.

Late stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.

Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

The London-listed company is in joint talks with Chinese state-run oil companies CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK), CNPC (601857.SS) and Sinopec (600028.SS) over its 27.5% holding in the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas venture, the British newspaper said.

Sakhalin-2 is controlled and operated by Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM). Other stakeholders in the project include Japan's Mitsui & Co (8031.T) and Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T).

The discussions with the Chinese firms include the potential sale of Shell's stake to one, two or all three of the companies, the newspaper said, adding that Shell is to be open to potential buyers outside China.

Shell declined to comment on the report, while Sinopec, CNOOC and CNPC did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Shell in February said it would exit all its Russian operations, including the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant, after sanctions tightened on Moscow. read more

He Joined The Paper In As An Assistant Business Editor', 'Has Overseen Finance', 'Real Estate', 'Washington Business Coverage. Darmiento Previously Had Been The Managing Editor Of The Los Angeles Business Journal', 'Was A Reporter For The Los Angeles Daily News', 'Other Outlets. A New York Native', 'He Is An Alumnus Of Cornell University.']	"The mega-mansion known as “The One” sold Thursday for $126 million at a bankruptcy auction. That’s a huge discount from its $295-million listing price, even with a 12% auction fee bringing the total to about $141 million.

The Bel-Air property set a record for the costliest house sold at auction, but it fell well short of the California sales record set by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who purchased a Malibu estate for $177 million in October. The most ever spent on a U.S. residence was $238 million by hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin for a New York City penthouse in 2019. Several international sales have surpassed $300 million.

The buyer will be disclosed by March 8, when paperwork must be submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Deborah Saltzman, who will hold a hearing later this month on whether to approve the sale. It is possible that the winning bidder will be a limited liability company, a legal entity often used by the wealthy to hide their real estate purchases.

More than three dozen prospective buyers toured the 944 Airole Way property over the last couple of months, including billionaires from the Middle East, Asia and California, The One’s listing agents have said.

Concierge Auctions, which handled the sale, said its auction site drew views from 170 countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy — and generated some 2,800 prospects.

However, after the online auction opened Monday, only five bidders from the United States and New Zealand participated. Most of the action occurred in the last few minutes.

Agent Brent Chang of Compass said the results were a cautionary tale and might prompt builders to think smaller, given that multiple huge mansions have gone into bankruptcy in the last few years. He also wondered if the timing was off given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The buyer pool for this is very small, and with everything happening in Russia, all of a sudden those Russian billionaires who may have been your best bet to buy it are pulling out,” he said.

The amount of debt attached to the property originally totaled about $180 million but has since grown to $256 million as more creditors have made claims, according to a March 2 court filing. That means many creditors will take losses — even though most of the auction house’s 12% fee will be returned to the bankrupt estate, which is not a typical arrangement.

The largest single creditor is Los Angeles billionaire Don Hankey, who lent $106 million to the dream project of developer Nile Niami. The lender is owed more than $130 million in secured debt, including money he provided in bankruptcy to repair and spiff up the property for sale.

Hankey, who previously said he might bid for the property if it was severely underpriced at the auction, said he did not make an offer. He said the sale should allow him to recover the cash he put into the project, but added that he was surprised at how low the final price was.

“The guy who bought it just got a great deal. He’s got people willing to pay $50,000 a day just to do commercials and films,” Hankey said.

The hilltop home, said to be 105,000 square feet, was marketed for $500 million several years ago while under construction but didn’t find a buyer. It was placed into bankruptcy in October after Hankey foreclosed on the $106 million in debt defaulted on by Crestlloyd, the limited liability company established by Niami that legally owns the project.

Turnaround specialist Lawrence Perkins, who was put in charge of Crestlloyd when the home was placed into bankruptcy, said the “market spoke” at the auction. However, he also said it was his responsibility to continue fielding late offers that might top the auction price.

“I’ve got an obligation if someone comes in, and there’s a better offer. We’re not soliciting them but it’s not closed until it’s closed,” he said. “Some people don’t want to participate in auctions.”

Broker Stephen Shapiro, the founding partner of Westside Estate Agency, said the low price reflected the “out-of-control ego” of Niami, who built a huge house that wasn’t really a home.

“Most builders build a house that people can live in,” he said. “He built one thinking there was going to be demand for this outrageous over-the-top house.”

Niami has been attempting to regain control of the property. In December, he proposed creating a cryptocurrency called The One Coin that would be backed by the mansion and pay off all the home’s debts.

Prior to the auction, a Niami spokesperson said the developer would not be commenting on the auction. He could not be reached for immediate comment Thursday.

The One is just the latest L.A. trophy home to end up in bankruptcy after a blitz of costly development in the region’s glitzy hillside and coastal communities.

Concierge Auctions last year set an auction record when it sold a Beverly Park home for $51 million — but that was still more than $100 million off its original asking price. Concierge said The One was the largest home ever sold at auction.

How much The One would go for had been something of a parlor game in the luxury real estate community, with some thinking it is the ultimate trophy home and others declaring it a white elephant.

The property includes a 4,000-square-foot guesthouse, a sky deck with cabanas, a private theater, a full-service spa, a nightclub and even an outdoor running track and moat. It has 21 bedrooms and 42 full bathrooms.

Amenities include a bowling alley, nightclub and plenty of room for swimming. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)

However, the mansion could end up being a project for the buyer.

The house isn’t 100% complete and lacks a certificate of occupancy, pending a sign-off from city inspectors on crucial permits for grading, electrical and other work. Also, it could have construction defects and zoning code violations, according to allegations in court documents.

The mansion was described on the Concierge website as the “largest in the urban world,” but by many accounts, a 27-story home said to be 400,000 square feet owned by a billionaire in Mumbai, India, is considered the world’s largest, outside of royal palaces. However, it may be the largest in the country.

Under the terms of the auction agreement, the winning bidder is under legal obligation to close the sale by the end of the month or lose a $250,000 deposit.

In making her determination whether to approve the deal, the judge will consider whether she believes the high bidder has the financial wherewithal to close the sale, its impact on creditors and other issues.

Other big creditors include Inferno Investment, a company run by Julien Remillard, a longtime Canadian investor of Niami’s. Inferno says it is owed $24 million. Yogi Securities, the investment vehicle of Joseph Englanoff, an L.A. doctor and another longtime Niami investor, says it is owed $14 million.

Compass agent Bret Parsons said that he thought the price more reflected the value of the hilltop property, with its commanding views across the city, than the house itself.

“It’s unfortunate that Mother Nature’s valuable resources can be plundered for ridiculous trophies,” he said.

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 4.95% last week, an increase of 22 basis points from a week earlier as rates close in on 5%.

Combined with the dramatic run-up in home prices the past two years, rising mortgage rates are making prospective monthly payments more expensive for homebuyers.

Experts say inflation and uncertain economic conditions, such as COVID-19 and Russia’s war in Ukraine, are largely responsible for the surge in rates recently.

Buyers should be sure to shop around for mortgage rates, as quotes from different lenders can vary considerably, experts say.

Between the median home listing price topping $400,000 for the first time and mortgage rates on the cusp of 5%, times have quickly gotten tough for homebuyers.

That doesn’t mean you need to give up, just be strategic about shopping for a home, says Jacob Channel, senior economic analyst at LendingTree.

“Now could still be a good time to buy a house, especially if you shop around for a mortgage, if you work on having a good credit score and a solid down payment,” he says. “It’s going to be a little bit of a challenge.”

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hit 4.95% ;last week, rising 22 basis points from the previous week and moving closer to a 5% milestone one expert told us last week could happen soon. Rates are up dramatically since the start of the year, when the average was around 3.3%.

“I know it can be scary if you read the news and see inflation is high, rates are high, and whatnot,” Channel says. “Always remember that any time can be a good time to buy a house.”

About the Latest Mortgage Rates Except where otherwise noted, mortgage rate data in this story is based on mortgage rate information provided by national lenders to Bankrate.com, which like NextAdvisor is owned by Red Ventures.

What’s Making Mortgage Rates Go Up?

The surge in mortgage rates so far this year is due to a variety of economic factors. Persistently high inflation is a big one, Channel says. Inflation was 7.9% in February according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest in 40 years. Interest rates tend to rise when inflation is high, he says. The Federal Reserve has also signaled it intends to take aggressive action – raising its benchmark short-term interest rate and making other moves – to rein in inflation, which could lead to further increases in interest rates.

On top of that, financial markets are still responding to other global factors that can affect the economy, namely the prospect of a resurgence of COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “​​We have a lot of factors like that that are putting upward pressure on mortgage rates,” Channel says.

Expert Prediction: Where Will Mortgage Rates Go in April?

Rates will probably keep moving up in April, experts told us. “I do think interest rates will continue to rise in April, I just don’t think it’s going to be as sharp of an increase as we saw from February into March,” Jodi Hall, president of Nationwide Mortgage Bankers, a national lender, told us.

Those predictions come with a grain of salt: A lot can change in the economy, and it can change quickly. “There’s just so much uncertainty in the marketplace at the moment that it’s so difficult to say exactly where they’re going,” Mike Schenk, chief economist for the Credit Union National Association, told us.

What Other Mortgage Industry Data Show

The average 30-year rate was also up in a similar survey by Freddie Mac, rising five basis points to 4.72%. It’s up a point and a half in the past three months, the fastest three-month rise since 1994, Freddie Mac said.

Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored entity that buys mortgages on the secondary market, and while its survey’s methodology and the time in which it collects data differ from others, such as the Bankrate survey referenced in this article. While the mortgage rate averages vary, they show similar trends over time.

Historical Mortgage Rates: Today’s Rates Are Still Favorable

Here’s a visual look at how current mortgage rates compare to the last 22 years.

The recent rise in mortgage rates looks dramatic after two years of rates around 3%, but even 5% isn’t too bad from a broader historical perspective. Compare it to where rates were before the 2008 financial crisis, when 5% would’ve been pretty good.

Home Prices Are Rising Too

A mortgage doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it’s a loan used to pay for property, so it’s important to consider rates alongside what’s happening to housing prices. Data from Realtor.com show the median U.S. home listing price was $405,000 in March, the first time it’s ever been over $400,000. That’s up 26.5% from two years earlier.

Experts tell us housing prices are up so dramatically because of a mismatch between supply and demand: There are a lot of people trying to buy houses and there aren’t enough houses to go around. That means you probably shouldn’t wait around and hope for the market to crash. Instead be strategic and patient with your home search. “I don’t think buyers should be betting on any really significant price declines,” Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, told us. “If anything, as interest rates move higher, the cost of buying a home is going to go up.”

How Can Homebuyers Deal With Rising Mortgage Rates?

It’s more important than ever to shop around for a mortgage when you’re in the market for a house, Channel says. When rates aren’t going up as dramatically as they are now, quotes from different lenders can regularly vary by half a percentage point. With the market moving so quickly, that could be even higher.

Know that buying a home isn’t just about getting a mortgage rate, Channel says. Be sure you’re in a good position to buy a house. “The most important thing that any would-be homebuyer should do is take stock of where they are personally,” he says. “Do I have enough cash to make my mortgage payments, to put money down on a down payment? Is my credit score good?”

Then, be patient and be creative with your home search. Don’t rush for the first houses you see, he says. Look in unexpected places. One possibility is the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s page of foreclosed homes. “The more you plan and the more diligent you are before you really even start going out house hunting actively, the easier it is to navigate a housing market that is as hot and fast as this one,” Channel says.

Is Refinancing Still a Good Option?

Rising rates mean fewer people can save money just by refinancing to get a lower interest rate. Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider, found 4 million homeowners could get a rate at least 0.75% lower by refinancing, with 2 million of those being “high-quality refinance candidates” who meet certain eligibility criteria.

While the demand for refinances has cooled off significantly, there could still be other reasons to do it, Channel says. One is for a cash-out refinance, in which you tap into the equity of your home to get cash for something like a home improvement project or debt consolidation. You might also want to convert a 30-year fixed rate loan to a 15-year loan or vice versa. “If you are in a position where you think you would benefit from modifying your loan in some way, it doesn’t hurt to ask a lender what they can offer you,” Channel says.
