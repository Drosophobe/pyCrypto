1999-07-21 00:00:00+00:00	JFK Jr. memorial service probably in New York	['Deseret News']	"NEW YORK (AP) -- Members of the Kennedy family have discussed a memorial service for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister with a priest at a New York City church.

The Rev. John Boehning of the Church of St. Thomas More said Tuesday that he had been speaking with Caroline Kennedy, the sister of JFK Jr., and other family representatives about a memorial at the Manhattan church.However, he said nothing was decided about where or when the memorial would be.

""I have been in touch with them and they are pursing options,"" said Boehning. ""One thing they were clear about, there were a lot of things to consider.""

Government sources said Kennedy family aides and friends were in New York, planning a memorial service for all three victims, perhaps on Saturday.

Boehning said that Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had attended the Roman Catholic church on the Upper East Side and that Kennedy family functions had been held there.

The wreckage of Kennedy's airplane was located Wednesday, with Kennedy's body still aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., according to senior government sources. There was no immediate word on whether the women's bodies also were found.

Meanwhile, a memorial Mass organized by the Irish community in New York is scheduled for Thursday night at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in lower Manhattan.

""It is intended to supplement whatever service the family will arrange and perhaps accommodate mourners who might not otherwise have an opportunity to pay their respects,"" said Brian O'Dwyer, head of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center.

1999-07-09 01:00:00+00:00	Braggart jailed for life for killing youth	[]	"A man who clubbed a teenager to death with a pool cue then bragged about it later was jailed for life yesterday.

The attack on 16-year-old Stephen Brady was so vicious the cue broke in pieces.

Unaware the boy was dying, Thomas Stewart, 37, told friends : ''If someone hadn't pulled me off him, I would have killed him.''

The High Court in Glasgow heard that Stewart also boasted: ''I kept hitting him until the cue was the size of a pencil.''

Stephen, of Waulkingmill Road, Clydebank, suffered skull and facial bone fractures and died from brain damage in hospital next day.

A jury found Stewart, of Faifley Road, Faifley, guilty by a majority of murdering the teenager in a video shop at Glasgow Road, Hardgate, on February 5 this year.

The murder charge against co-accused Stuart McInnes, 32, of Langfaulds Crescent, Faifley, was found not proven and he walked free from court.

A neighbour of Stewart, Ms Elizabeth Murray, 35, told the court about the boasts. She said she was in Stewart's house, where he was drinking with McInnes and others, when she also heard him saying: ''Something flew off. I think it was a piece of his ear.''

The court heard there was trouble that night with a crowd of teenagers outside the video shop where Ms Pamela Stewart, the accused's sister, was working.

She was about to close at 10pm with 19-year-old Jennifer Wood when 16-year-old Graham Richards ran in, chased by Christopher Mullen, also 16. As the youths battled behind the counter, Pamela ran to the bar next door and shouted that teenagers armed with baseball bats were robbing the shop.

The jury saw a video of men grabbing pool cues and rushing to the shop, led by Stewart.

They pushed past armed teenagers crowded round the doorway and Stewart came face to face with Stephen, whom he claimed was wielding a baseball bat.

Witnesses told Mr Philip Brodie QC, prosecuting they saw Stewart hitting the teenager with his pool cue and heard the crack as it broke."
