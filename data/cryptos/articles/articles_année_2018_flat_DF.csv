Looking at the market as a whole, however, gives us a bigger picture of who were the biggest losers and which coins were the best at storing value.

Total Market Cap Still 11 Times Bigger Than in 2017

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization hit highs of a staggering $830bn in the week commencing January 7, 2018, some $813bn – or nearly fifty times that of the same week in 2017 which stood at $17bn, with Bitcoin [coin_price] accounting for 35% of the total market share.

Nine months on and the euphoria that took hold at the end of 2017 has been replaced with despair and total capitulation of many investors. Total market cap now standing at $187bn; a staggering $643bn or 77% lower than highs earlier in 2018.

It is important to note that while the 2017 hype cycle has somewhat reversed, the total market cap is still 11 times what it was at the start of 2017.

Whilst some of the latecomers to the 2017 market are the biggest value losers, many investors in the space are still waist-deep in gains.

Total Market Cap 2018

Bitcoin [coin_price] has lost the greatest total value of $179 bn, representing a reduction of ‘only’ 62% from the highs seen earlier in the year, however, compared to an 85% reduction in that of the altcoins, which have lost $464bn.

Having spectacularly inflated and subsequently deflated, we can take a closer look at the biggest losers in the market:

Ripple [coin_price coin=ripple], NEM [coin_price coin=nem] Cardano [coin_price coin=ada], and TRON [coin_price coin=tron] have all lost over 90% of their value, with most of the other top coins being close behind.

Ripple, Ethereum [coin_price coin=ethereum] and Bitcoin Cash [coin_price coin=bitcoin-cash] have lost a staggering $244bn; more than twice the current total market cap of Bitcoin and nearly the total value of Bitcoin at its heights.

The only top coin to ‘outperform’ Bitcoin is EOS [coin_price coin=eos], which has only lost 43% of its value earlier in January 2018 and doubled its market share, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.

Bitcoin Dominance



While the remainder of the market appears to be continuing to fall, Bitcoin has represented a relative flight to safety for many investors.

Bitcoin has regained some 23% of the total market share from altcoins, hitting a dominance of 58%, with no sign of slowing down.

So while questions remain as to where the bottom will be found for each cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has been stubbornly holding up its market cap lows at around $100bn as others have ‘decoupled.’

Bad News For Cryptocurrencies Not Named ‘Bitcoin’

Assuming investors do not leave the space, a ‘flight to bitcoin’ may result in an uptick in market transactions. Many investors are now tracking Bitcoin value on a network transaction basis, meaning an uptick would potentially serve as an indicator of a value investment with Bitcoin being 62% below its highs of around $20,000.

Questions will remain as to whether investors will return to the lower cap coins after such large price swings without fundamental demonstrative value. But surely some of those who exited the market will find it difficult to resist getting back into a market, which is down 85% from its previous highs.

Is the market dominance reversal indicative of the beginning of the end of the market correction, or is there some way to go?

Will the Bitcoin dominance continue for the forseeable future? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Those who bought cryptocurrency at the start of 2017 likely felt pretty savvy in December. But if you bought late last year, that's certainly not the case today. The entire crypto market has lost roughly 65 percent of its value as of Thursday but some coins have fared worse than others. Here's where you'd stand if you invested $1,000 in the top five coins at the height of their hype:

Bitcoin

Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency has held up better than others. It's down more than 54 percent this year, and was trading around $6,400 Thursday. The cryptocurrency became a household name as it hit a high near $20,000 on December 16, 2017. If you put $1,000 into bitcoin on that day, you would have lost about $650, with $350 left in it today.

Ether

The world's second largest cryptocurrency has nosedived 70 percent this year, and fell 15 percent this week alone. Ether is the name of the cryptocurrency but it's closely associated to the popular Ethereum blockchain. Unlike bitcoin, which gives access to a global financial network, ether gives you access to a computer network. Investors saw an opportunity in its use case for building applications but that hype has faded significantly this year. If you put $1,000 in ether at its high in January, you would have lost $836.

Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash is an offshoot of the original bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was born last August out of a ""fork,"" by a group of developers who were frustrated with some technology issues behind bitcoin, including ""scalability."" Bitcoin Cash increased the size of the blocks, meaning more transactions could happen per second. If you put $1,000 in bitcoin cash at the high in December, you would have lost $858 by September of this year.

Litecoin

Litecoin would have been a great investment if you got in early — it was up 8,000 percent at one point last year. The cryptocurrency was inspired and technically, is almost identical to bitcoin but proponents say transactions are faster and cheaper. If you bet $1,000 on Litecoin at its high in December, you would have lost $833 as of Thursday. The cryptocurrency is now trading around $50 after topping $330 late last year.

Medium of exchange: Crypto-currencies are not readily accepted as a medium of exchange. Despite sporadic news that appear from time to time, we have seen no real evidence that crypto-currencies are widely used as a medium of exchange in the purchase of goods or services in any meaningful scale. While it is true that crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin have attracted many investors and speculators around the world who own and trade them, it is very different from such crypto-currencies being accepted as a medium of exchange. As a matter of fact, Bitcoin is a very inefficient means of payment for several reasons. First, as Bitcoin operates in a decentralised network, each Bitcoin transaction needs to be validated by the so-called “miners”, who need to solve a complex maths problem using specialised computers. It takes a lot of time and consumes considerable electricity to complete a transaction. Currently, the average transaction time is some 20 minutes per transaction. During periods of high network traffic, the average transaction time can take anywhere from 30 minutes to many hours. Transaction fee is also high and can spike up suddenly from time to time. The average fee per transaction in December 2017 was US$34. To put the matter into proper perspective, electronic payments, using either balances kept by commercial banks at central banks or retail payments using commercial bank balances, typically take a few seconds and cost a fraction of the transaction fees in Bitcoin transfers."
2018-09-06 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin sheds almost $1,000 in 24 hours	['Will Martin']	"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to lose value on Thursday.

Bitcoin has dropped almost $1,000 in value over the last 24 hours.

Ethereum has slumped 20% to its lowest level in over a year.

The move downwards started on Wednesday, and was exacerbated by a Business Insider report that Goldman Sachs has shelved plans to create a bitcoin trading desk.

You can track the price of bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies at Markets Insider.

The sharp sell-off that gripped cryptocurrency markets on Wednesday has extended into a second day, with major digital assets across the spectrum continuing to fall during trading on Thursday.

Wednesday's initial move seemed to have no real catalyst, beyond a theory put forward by Tanya Abrosimova of FXStreet is that the introduction of a registration process for the popular instant bitcoin exchange ShapeShift may have spooked some users and triggered at least part of the drop.

The slump was then exacerbated by a Business Insider report that Goldman Sachs has put plans to launch a bitcoin trading desk on hold for the foreseeable future.

That news saw bitcoin hold 4% lower at around $7,000 per coin, before falling again late on Wednesday evening. It has held relatively steady since then, but has now fallen more than $1,000 in value in just two trading sessions.

By around 9.40 a.m. ET, bitcoin is trading at $6,428, a drop of 4.1% since the session's beginning.

The crypto slump is impacting other currencies, with litecoin and bitcoin cash both lower by more than 3%, while ethereum, has slumped 20% in value over the past 24 hours, falling to its lowest level in over a year.

In line with ethereum’s latest fall, hundreds of alt-coins on the website coinmarketcap.com have posted declines of around 20% over the last 24 hours."
