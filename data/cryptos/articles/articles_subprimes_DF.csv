Thanks to the Boston Globe, I've been made aware of a great money-saving option for those parents of the bride still conscious after totaling up the costs of unloading giving over to matrimony your bundle of joy.

The price of modern wedding cakes can easily hit $500 or more, depending on the architecture and square footage. When you see the newlyweds grind $100 or so of this treasure into one another's faces, you may ask yourself if this is a wise use of your money. Obviously, many have answered no, the inspiration behind the fake wedding cake.

This cake, made of plastic foam and other durable materials and iced to look like the real thing, includes a discrete hatch in the bottom layer. Behind this hatch is secreted a piece of real cake which the bride or groom can grab for the ritual mutual feeding. Once this is accomplished, the faux cake is wheeled away to be 'cut' (you choose whether or not to let the guests in on the charade). At this point, slices of an inexpensive sheet cake can be substituted, while the fake cake is put away for the next ceremony.

I'm not a big fan of wedding ceremony, so this makes perfect sense to me. The question is, however, will the bride's mother accept the substitution? We all know she has the final word."
2007-11-04 23:18:23+00:00	UPDATE 1-Citigroup CEO resigns, $8-11 bln writedown seen	['Jonathan Stempel', 'Dan Wilchins']	"(Adds CEO resignation, write-down)

NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Charles Prince has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Citigroup Inc C.N, which plans to take an additional $8 billion to $11 billion of write-downs for credit and other losses, the Wall Street Journal said on Sunday.

Robert Rubin, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary, will become Citigroup’s chairman, while Sir Win Bischoff, the chairman of Citigroup’s European operations, will become interim chief executive, the newspaper said.

Citigroup did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prince’s departure ends a tumultuous four-year tenure marked by heavy management turnover, questions over strategy, and mounting losses from bad loans and mortgages.

The added write-down would come just three weeks after Citigroup announced a $6.5 billion write-down for loan losses, subprime mortgages and other debt.

It would also come five days after Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N ousted its own chief executive, Stanley O'Neal, following an $8.4 billion write-down.

Citigroup has said it wants to boost capital, and CIBC World Markets analyst Meredith Whitney estimated that more than $30 billion may be needed. The problems are spurring more calls for the bank to be broken up because it is too unwieldy.

“I just don’t think (Prince) was the right person to run Citigroup,” said Jim Huguet, co-chief executive of Great Companies LLC in Tampa, Florida, a Citigroup shareholder. “He was brought in to fix their legal problems because he’s a lawyer, but they need someone who is capable of really building the business, and I don’t think that’s Prince’s forte.”

Rubin, 69, joined Citigroup in 1999 after more than four years as Treasury secretary, and chairs the bank’s executive committee. He has long been a close adviser to Prince, focused on strategy rather than day-to-day operations. Before joining the Clinton administration, Rubin had spent 26 years at Goldman Sachs & Co, becoming co-chairman of the investment bank.

Bischoff assumed his present position in May 2000 after the acquisition of Schroders Plc’s investment banking business by Citigroup unit Salomon Smith Barney. He had been chairman of Schroders since May 1995.

THE DANCING ENDS

Prince, 57, has struggled to improve results at Citigroup, especially in U.S. consumer banking, its biggest business.

He has also been under enormous pressure to cut expenses, including from the New York-based bank’s largest individual investor, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.

While he appeared to have some success early this year, the write-down all but thwarted that goal for 2007.

Prince didn’t help his cause in July when he said Citigroup was “still dancing” to a private equity buyout boom that was about to flame out, suggesting to investors that he didn’t appreciate the risks in leveraged lending.

Citigroup also has exposure to mortgages through tens of billions of dollars of off-balance-sheet structured investment vehicles, and is in talks with rivals to set up a conduit to buy assets from troubled SIVs.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether Citigroup accounted properly for its own SIVs, the Wall Street Journal said.

Investors have pushed Citigroup shares down 32 percent this year. The stock is also down 17 percent since Prince in October 2003 took over as the hand-picked successor of Sanford “Sandy” Weill, his mentor since joining a Baltimore firm called Commercial Credit Co in 1986.

It’s not clear who might become Citigroup’s permanent chief executive. Upper management has undergone rapid turnover, leaving the bank without an obvious immediate successor.

Analysts have said John Thain, who runs NYSE Euronext NYX.NNYX.PA, might be a candidate. Internal candidates may include Vikram Pandit, who oversees investment banking and alternative investments, and Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden. Analysts have said neither may be ready yet.

Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N and Swiss bank UBS AG UBSN.VX also shook up top management in 2007 after credit losses.

REVOLVING LEADERSHIP DOOR

The first half of Prince’s tenure was marked by a cleanup of ethical and regulatory problems. Citigroup paid more than $5 billion to settle litigation, including over its work for Enron Corp and WorldCom Inc and the issuance of inflated stock research by analysts like the now-discredited Jack Grubman.

Prince bowed deeply at a October 2004 Tokyo news conference in apology for a scandal that caused the closure of Citigroup’s private bank in Japan. The U.S. Federal Reserve barred the bank from acquisitions for a year while it cleaned up its house.

When Prince refocused on Citigroup’s operations, he emphasized organic growth, especially outside the United States, saying Citigroup was too big to pursue the “transformational” acquisitions that marked Weill’s tenure.

He sold asset management and insurance units, and added branches and lending offices for the stagnating U.S. consumer banking unit. Acquisitions, apart from a pending purchase of Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp 8603.T, were small.

But revenue didn’t grow fast enough, while expenses grew too much. Prince in April set 17,000 job cuts companywide."
