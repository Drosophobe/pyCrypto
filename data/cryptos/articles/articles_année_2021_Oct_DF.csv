Redman Has Been An Active Member Of The Cryptocurrency Community Since He Has A Passion For Bitcoin', 'Open-Source Code', 'Decentralized Applications.

The price of bitcoin recently jumped above the $60,000 per unit mark on October 15, and the leading crypto asset has not seen prices this high since mid-April six months ago. However, as far as the top digital assets are concerned, in terms of market capitalization, things are a whole lot different. For instance, ether tokens are worth a lot more than they were six months ago and binance coin values were higher back then than they are today.

Six Months Later as Bitcoin Returns to $60K, Some Crypto Coins Trade for More Value, While Others Trade for Less

On April 11, 2021, statistics from coinmarketcap.com’s historical snapshot data show that on that day, bitcoin (BTC) exchanged hands for $60,204 per unit. BTC also reached an all-time high three days later on Apr 14, 2021, at $64,804 per coin that week. The data from the historical snapshot indicates that ethereum (ETH) was swapping for $2,157 per coin on April 11 and today, a single ether is trading for $3,761 per unit.

The stats six months ago show binance coin (BNB) held the third position six months ago and at the time each BNB traded for $525. Prices are a bit lower than they were back then and BNB lost the third position to cardano (ADA) for a few months. Today, metrics show that BNB is swapping for $480 per coin which is 9.375% lower than the price six months ago. At that time, XRP held the fourth position in terms of market cap but today, XRP has slid to the sixth position.

The stablecoin tether (USDT) held the fifth spot back then, today it is sitting at number four. Like ethereum (ETH), cardano (ADA) is another coin that was trading for lower prices on April 11. At the time, ADA exchanged hands for $1.27 per coin and on October 18, ADA trades for $2.12 per unit. Polkadot (DOT) held the seventh position trading for $41.42 per DOT six months ago, today DOT trades for a touch lower at $40.76 and sits in the eighth largest position.

Litecoin, Uniswap, Chainlink Bumped Out of the Top 10 — Theta, Filecoin, Tron, Vechain Slip Out of the Top 20

Litecoin (LTC), uniswap (UNI), and chainlink (LINK) held the last three positions in the top ten respectively. But none of these coins are in the top ten positions anymore and UNI is the closest today. Positioned at 14 today, UNI is trading for $25.39 but on April 11, the token changed hands for $29.98. LTC was holding the eighth largest market valuation six months ago, but today it has slid to the 16th largest. LTC exchanged hands for $253.63 and today its much lower at $185.22.

Chainlink (LINK) was swapping hands for $33.92 per LINK back then, but on October 18, the price is around $25.59. LINK at that time held the tenth-largest spot and it now holds the 18th position. Missing from the top 20 coins that were seen on the list back then include tokens like theta (THETA) filecoin (FIL), tron (TRON) and vechain (VET). One notable gainer is solana (SOL) which moved from the 20th top position to the crypto economy’s seventh-largest spot in terms of valuation.

What do you think about the top ten crypto coin shift and some of the crypto assets that were bumped out of the top ten and twenty market positions during the last six months?

He Began Writing About Blockchain Technology In He Has Managed Numerous Crypto-Related Projects', 'Is Passionate About All Things Blockchain.']	"The price of bitcoin has jumped to a weekly high of nearly $45,000 amid positive news coming from the US Fed Chair – Jerome Powell. Most alternative coins have also marked substantial daily gains, with ETH rising above $3,100 and BNB jumping to $400.

Bitcoin Eyes $45K

The tides seemed to have turned in the cryptocurrency space in the past 24 hours. On Wednesday, bitcoin had dumped below $41,000 for the third time since the start of the week, and the situation looked grim at best.

However, the bulls managed to intercept this drop just like the previous ones and pushed the asset north. As reported yesterday, this resulted in BTC exceeding $43,000.

The cryptocurrency even attempted to break above $44,000 but was initially stopped. However, BTC shot up in the hours after and neared $45,000. This came shortly after the US Federal Reserve Chairman – Jerome Powell – said during a two-hour House Finance Services Committee meeting that the country has no intentions to ban cryptocurrencies.

As a result, bitcoin spiked to its current level, which is the highest it has been in a week. Consequently, its market capitalization has increased to $850 billion.

Alts See Nothing But Green

Most larger-cap alternative coins remained stagnant in the past few days. This is not the case now, though. Ethereum had fallen to $2,900 and struggled to reclaim $3,000. However, a 5% daily increase has driven the second-largest cryptocurrency to above $3,100 as of now.

Cardano also dipped hard during the week but currently stands at $2.15 after a 4.5% jump. Binance Coin, which was the best performer yesterday, continues to impress again with an 8.5% increase to over $400.

Ripple (4.5%), Solana (6%), Polkadot (7.5%), Dogecoin (3%), Terra (11%), Avalanche (1.5%), Uniswap (9.5%), and Chainlink (6%) are also well in the green.

Further gains are evident from OMG Network (23%), VeChain (21%), Qtum (19%), Tezos (15%), IOTA (11%), THORChain (11%), AMP (11%), Arweave (11%), and ICON (10%).

The cryptocurrency market cap has increased by roughly $100 billion and is just shy of $2 trillion."

Russian president Vladimir Putin has expressed support for payments in cryptocurrency

Bitcoin and Crypto Market Watch

The global cryptocurrency market continued to grow this week to levels previously seen in May 2021 with the market cap crossing $2.4 trillion. Bitcoin rallied by 8% in the last 7 days to within touching distance of $60,000 today. It is currently trading near $59,400 as of 5 pm IST today. Bitcoin’s dominance of the market has steadily climbed to 46% over the past few weeks as reports of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granting approval to the Bitcoin Futures ETF this month continues to lift market sentiment.

In this article, we will track other stories that drove adoption in the crypto market this week.

Governments explore digital currencies

G7 finance leaders recently have set out 13 guiding principles for retail central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to support policy and design deliberations within and beyond the group. G7 is an inter-governmental political forum comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In this context, blockchain companies Ripple (ticker XRP) and Avalanche (ticker AVAX) have joined an independent group to support the development of a digital UK pound.

Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, has expressed support for cryptocurrencies as a means of payment although he remained skeptical of its use for oil contracts. Russia ruled out a blanket ban on crypto trading similar to China.

Investment firms see potential in crypto-based companies

Moonpay, a crypto fintech startup that allows the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies and digital assets using debit, credit cards and local bank transfers, has reportedly raised $400 million in its first round of funding led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management.

Crypto lending firm Celsius network has raised $400 million in a new equity funding round led by Canada’s second largest-pension fund CDPQ and WestCap, an equity firm.

More synergies between crypto and fiat emerge

Bakkt, a US cryptocurrency marketplace, has partnered with Google to allow its debit card users to purchase goods and services using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the Google Pay wallet.

Strike, a payments company responsible for the Bitcoin tipping feature on Twitter, has released a new product feature called “Pay me in Bitcoin” which allows anyone to convert a portion of their income into Bitcoin with no fees.

With Bitcoin heading towards its all-time high in the near future, more institutional capital and strong retail participation is expected in the upcoming months.

2021-10-04 02:17:12+00:00	Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin gains, ether, cardano slip. Latest rates here	[]	"Cryptocurrency prices today were mixed with Bitcoin trading below $48,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped by about $2,500 within a matter of minutes on Friday and was trading around $48,000 for most of the weekend, having spent more than a week before that in the lower $40,000s.

Bitcoin prices today were marginally higher at $47,946. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 65% this year (year-to-date), and much below its record of near $65,000 it had hit in April.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, plunged over 1% to $3,378. Cardano prices also fell to $2.22 whereas dogecoin rose marginally to $0.22. The performance of other digital tokens including XRP, Litecoin, Stellar were also mixed over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin rose on Friday to its highest level since around mid-September, bolstered in part by seasonal factors as well as supportive comments overall from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday.

Bitcoin was hit on multiple fronts in September, including a botched roll-out of the coin as legal tender in El Salvador and tightening of regulatory oversights in the US and China. It delivered a negative return for the fifth straight year for the 30-day period last month. The crypto asset has been on a losing streak in terms of monthly performance in September since 2017.

China's central bank had said all financial transactions involving cryptocurrencies are illegal, sounding the death knell for the digital trade in the country after a crackdown on the volatile digital tokens.

China has been tightening its crackdown on cryptocurrencies, and its efforts to restrain the trading and mining are adding to the wild moves in bitcoin and other markets, which are already down hard from records set earlier this year.

2021-10-22 02:13:53+00:00	Bitcoin falls from record high, ether, other cryptos also plunge. Check cryptocurrency prices today	[]	"Cryptocurrency prices plunged today as Bitcoin declined from its all-time high it had hit two days ago after the debut of the first US bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund. The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading 4% lower at $62,740.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, was down over 2% to $4,112, as per CoinDesk. Cardano prices fell nearly 3% to $2.16 whereas dogecoin also slipped 3% to $0.24. Other digital tokens like Shiba Inu, Binance Coin, Litecoin, Uniswap, XRP were also trading with cuts over the last 24 hours, though, Solana was up over 10%.

Bitcoin on Wednesday rallied to a record high of $66,974, the recent rally came after six-months from its previous top of $64,895, fueled by the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Investors have bet the long-awaited launch of bitcoin ETFs will lead to greater investment from both retail and institutional investors.

Yet analysts at JPMorgan voiced doubt over how long-lasting the boost to bitcoin's price from the ProShares ETF, which trades under the ticker BITO, would be. ""Will the launch of BITO by itself bring significantly more fresh capital into bitcoin? We doubt it given the multitude of investment choices bitcoin investors already have,"" they wrote in a note, as reported by Reuters.

The ETF doesn’t invest directly in Bitcoin. It instead invests in the futures market tied to Bitcoin. Someone with an old-school brokerage account can buy the ETF, for example, without having to open a trading account for crypto.

2021-09-29 19:25:30+00:00	Regulating the unregulated cryptocurrency market	['Christina Pazzanese', 'Harvard Staff Writer']	"Is cryptocurrency the future of global banking and trade, or a sketchy payment and investment vehicle favored by scammers and speculators, criminal organizations, and any individual or entity shut out of Western banking systems, like North Korea?

The jury is still out. One thing that is clear, however, is that the cryptocurrency market continues to grow as its popularity has become more mainstream since 2019. Even many once-skeptical institutional investors have come around after seeing some of the mind-boggling returns. In January 2019, one Bitcoin traded for $3,441; this week, it hit $43,136.

But that success may have a price. Calls to rein in the industry are at fever pitch. This month China, one of the world’s largest digital currency markets, outlawed all crypto-related transactions. It banned trading them in 2019. The U.S. Treasury said this week it will sanction a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time for facilitating ransomware payments. New tax and trading rules for the industry are included in legislation Congress is scheduled to vote on by week’s end. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also pushing for greater enforcement. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler called cryptocurrency an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse” and said investors don’t have enough regulatory protection from the swarms jumping into crypto finance, issuance, trading, and lending.

Q&A

Scott Duke Kominers

GAZETTE: There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, but no consensus on the precise number. The range is between 5,000 and 12,000, valued at about $2 trillion. What does the landscape look like today?

KOMINERS: Those numbers sound huge, but there are actually many, many more than that because lots of crypto products are not currencies and lots of cryptocurrencies are too small to be part of mainstream exchanges. Many crypto products are effectively just tokens. Sometimes these are representative of ownership in decentralized autonomous organizations, which are organizations that share governance rights and returns to a committee of participants by allocating them tokens — a bit like stock shares. There are project-specific tokens used in specific online games or among individual communities. There are NFTs, which are unique non-fungible tokens that have been used as representing ownership over things like digital artworks. Tons of these are being minted daily at this point. So, there is a very large landscape. The pure currency aspect of it is a huge market on its own, but a drop in the bucket of the total applications of crypto and blockchain technology today.

GAZETTE: What’s the appeal for investors? Is it just the eye-popping returns or is there more to it?

KOMINERS: Some people have gotten interested in cryptocurrency because of the investment returns, unquestionably. But there are also real, practical infrastructure and technology benefits. You’re starting to see countries willing to receive officially recognized crypto payments. And people have been considering whether crypto technology can be used to deliver government aid. This is because when it’s working, crypto is frictionless, and thus creates a much more efficient way of transferring and sharing value among people. And, as a result, there’s a real opportunity to use crypto for large-scale payments, as well as in things like small business payment processing. Also, there’s a big opportunity for enhancing financial inclusion, by providing secure payment networks and cross-border transfers in places that don’t otherwise have well-structured consumer financial systems. So, while some people are interested in this for the short- or medium-term investment opportunity, I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.

GAZETTE: The SEC chairman called this an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.” Is this industry operating in a rule-free, “Wild West” atmosphere, as he suggested?

KOMINERS: I haven’t read the full Gensler remarks, so I can’t comment explicitly on his overall take, but I can comment on some of the individual elements you mention. It’s clear that this space needs much more consumer protection, and we’re starting to see that. Right now, if a hacker gains access to your crypto wallet, they can drain it and you may have no recourse. But the newer waves of wallet technologies and crypto exchanges are thinking hard about all the things consumers expect out of banking products and equities trading accounts. They’re trying to create more security and protections at the consumer-interface level. And then, of course, you also need regulation to prevent financial crime and scams, just like we have in other parts of the financial-services industry.

GAZETTE: Some lawmakers have pointed to the GameStop stock trading frenzy in early 2021 as analogous to the crypto market, saying that most ordinary investors have gotten caught up in hype and don’t fully understand the risks they’re taking.

“I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.”

KOMINERS: First of all, it’s important to note that the GameStop run-up wasn’t in a new trading arena — it was Internet-hyped trading of a specific stock in the regular stock market. That said, the GameStop story is in some sense analogous to the meme trading of crypto products like Dogecoin — there’s consumer confusion around the idea that these assets could lose value. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the GameStop and Dogecoin run-ups and crashes. They were on a platform that made trading feel like a video game, and didn’t understand the real risks. And so in those ways, it’s analogous. Consumers and investors need to understand that these are high variance, speculative assets.

But when you get to the technology infrastructure pieces, GameStop and crypto can look very different. Cryptocurrency trading now looks a lot like equities trading — you have a brokerage account at an exchange, or potentially on a platform like Robinhood. But for many of the other crypto applications, the infrastructure is very, very new, and the platforms are very, very new, and they’re not heavily protected.

I think we’ll see more regulation around messaging and communication, but there are also more structural questions. For example, one of the regulatory conversations is around stablecoins — crypto assets that hold nominally fixed values because they’re designed to just be used for moving money from one place to another in a fixed denomination. They’re typically backed by reserves in a way similar to how banks back their loans with deposits. But there are questions about how to properly structure those reserves. If everyone simultaneously decided they wanted to divest, will stablecoins have the reserves to support that? I expect to see regulation around allowable assets and reserve design — just like we have with banks.

And finally, we’ll need regulation to ensure open competition among different crypto products and platforms.

GAZETTE: Besides fending off regulations, what are the industry’s other challenges?

KOMINERS: One basic challenge is around taxation of crypto income. This isn’t just about tax avoidance concerns — a lot of people would like to pay taxes on their crypto but have absolutely no idea how to do so. We don’t have clear crypto categories for taxation purposes, so it’s extremely complicated to figure out which parts are ordinary income versus capital gains, as well as when the associated income has accrued. Organizing the tax treatment of all these assets — and then, of course, ensuring tax payment — is essential.

Another challenge is environmental: A lot of the most popular crypto technologies at the moment require tremendous amounts of energy to run. And so, we’re going to start seeing government leadership and regulation driving a shift toward versions of this technology that are more environmentally sustainable.

Bitcoin and other early blockchains use a technology where you have to prove that you solved a very hard computational problem to record transactions securely. And solving those computational problems is taking up absurd amounts of energy. Newer blockchains use much less energy-intensive ways of validating transactions. And so, my guess and hope is that the way we’re going to get away from environmentally harmful cryptocurrency transactions is through continual improvements in the technology, alongside regulation and market forces pushing toward technologies that are much more efficient.

GAZETTE: If new regulations are on the way, what would be the best- or worst-case scenarios for the industry?

KOMINERS: I don’t think it’s a question of ‘no regulation’ versus ‘a lot.’ The real question is the extent to which regulators understand that crypto is a different type of product and tech infrastructure from anything they’ve regulated before. The worst case would be to just treat it like historical financial products or like historical tech platforms without thinking about the ways in which crypto differs, both in terms of its use cases and in terms of its underlying technology."

The cryptocurrency traded 7.6% higher at $54,873.02, according to Coin Metrics. Ether also rose 2.8% to $3,575.73.

Bitcoin rose as high as $55,499 earlier in the session. It's up 13% this week alone and 87% for the year.

The rally comes amid a series of small developments in Washington, D.C. that have provided some comfort to institutional investors keen to jump into cryptocurrencies.

""Regulatory uncertainty is what's still keeping investors out of the market and every time we get a step closer to regulatory clarity, you see this kind of reaction,"" Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matt Hougan said. ""It's the primary driver of next great bull market in crypto.""

According to financial advisors surveyed by Bitwise, the number one thing preventing them from making allocations to crypto is regulatory uncertainty. Hougan said the majority result has been the same three years in a row.

On Tuesday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said in a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee that he has no plans to ban cryptocurrency, and that a ban would be up to Congress.

Gensler's comments mirror those made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who also said Friday he has no plans to ban cryptocurrencies.

""You had every major regulatory agency in the U.S. this summer declaring that they needed to create a new regulatory regime around crypto,"" Hougan added. ""That created a great deal of uncertainty in investors minds, they were hesitant to allocate not knowing what the range of possibilities would be. The reason we're rallying this week is that most extreme left tail of following the path of China was wiped from the market by both Jerome Powell and Gary Gensler.""

Herd mentality

Genesis head of market insights Noelle Acheson said Wednesday's price action is different from previous ones this year and that all signs point to it being institutionally driven.

""Institutional investors move as a herd, they are momentum chasers,"" she said. ""When they see this kind of momentum, they start to think, what am I going to miss? Is my performance going to be weaker than those of my competitors? Maybe I should pile into that.""

She noted that Bitcoin has maintained its rank in the top five performing digital assets over the past 24 hours. That's something Acheson had never ever seen before, as top performers are usually smaller altcoins and DeFi assets. Bitcoin is the institutional onramp to crypto, and when it's one of the top performers, it's a sign the institutions are coming, Acheson said.

She added that with a sharp price jump, there tend to be several short positions that get liquidated, but that wasn't the case Wednesday.

""At one stage that price jumped 3.5% in a five-minute window, and without the liquidations, that says that that is big spot buying,"" Acheson said.

Another big signal came from the CME.

On Wednesday, it had the highest basis spread — the difference between bitcoin futures prices and the spot price — of any of the exchanges, Acheson said. She called it ""unusual"" because the CME basis normally trails that of the other exchanges. She added that CME is the exchange that offers the lowest leverage, so while it may not be the one used by traders or hedge funds that want leverage, it's the one traditional institutions often choose to use because it's currently the only crypto derivatives exchange with federal oversight.

The macro backdrop

At the same time, stocks were falling as concerns about rising rates, higher inflation, the state of the reopening and the debt limit dented investor sentiment. Bitcoin hasn't proven itself to be a safe-haven asset — its price has tanked with the stock market several times before — but many still see it that way and it was holding up amid Wednesday's equity market turmoil.

""The Janet Yellen discussion yesterday was a major reason to buy bitcoin,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday morning on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""If you parse what she's saying and it becomes true, the dollar doesn't seem to be as valuable as crypto.""

Yellen warned on Tuesday that inflationary pressures hitting the U.S. economy could last for several months and that the U.S. should fully expect a recession if the debt limit isn't lifted within two weeks.

""Thus far we've seen cryptos behave as a hybrid somewhere between a commodity and a currency,"" Morgan Stanley Wealth Management chief investment officer Lisa Shalett told ""Squawk on the Street."" So the ""volatility has been 4x that of stocks."""
2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin bounces back above $55,000, but trader has his eye on two other cryptocurrencies	['Keris Lahiff']	"Bitcoin just made a major comeback.

The cryptocurrency rallied on Wednesday, topping $55,000 and hitting its highest level since mid-May. Regulatory fears have eased this week after both Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and SEC chair Gary Gensler said they have no plans to impose restrictions on cryptocurrency trading.

Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, had a plan over the summer to beef up his position in bitcoin as its price plummeted – re-entering at $32,000 and adding to it if it fell to as low as $20,000.

""It didn't get there. I didn't get my full position on but what that ultimately did is it got me doing more research and trying to find where else could I invest this money that I want to be in crypto,"" Baruch told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Wednesday.

Baruch highlights two cryptocurrencies he is getting behind as an alternative to bitcoin – Solana and Algorand.

""Solana is actually my highest holding right now, got in that at a good time and that has risen pretty sharply. I think that has legs to go as well from here... and Algorand to me feels like Solana two to three years ago,"" he said.

Algorand looks constructive on the charts, he continues. Baruch says it looks to be a buy so long as it holds above $1.50. It traded at $1.82 on Wednesday."
2021-10-07 00:00:00+00:00	A Young Crypto With Big Potential	[]	"Long-term, regular readers of my musings will know that I was an early, enthusiastic supporter of Bitcoin (BTC). Far from seeing it as some kind of con trick or Ponzi scheme as some prominent bankers and pundits did when BTC/USD was at around $250, I recognized the potential real-world applications of not just Bitcoin but, more importantly, the blockchain concept as a whole.

Recently, however, I have gone somewhat quiet on the subject. Once the whole world knew what Bitcoin was and where its potential lie, and after BTC/USD jumped to around $50,000, there was no room for evangelicals such as myself. There are only so many times you can say “I told you so” to the early doubters, many of whom now talk about Bitcoin as if they had always been bullish.

Since those early days, of course, there have been countless other cryptos launched. Some that attempt to represent value only as a currency, face the problem of competing directly with the name recognition and acceptance of Bitcoin, but others that have focused more on the practical uses of blockchain technology have emerged and thrived. The most notable of those is Ethereum (ETH), and its token, ether.

If value is derived from name recognition and speculative value, as is the case now with Bitcoin and some other altcoins, there is little room for improvement on the basic concept, so challenging the established leader in the field is extremely difficult. When it comes to something like ether where the blockchain is used to facilitate transactions, on the other hand, there is always the danger that a better mousetrap will come along. In that case, the early adoption advantage of something like Bitcoin or Ethereum doesn’t apply. In fact, being a late entrant when the problems of the early entrants into the market are known has significant advantages.

That is why, right now, I am interested in Algorand.

Algorand has an impressive bloodline, having been developed in part by the MIT professor and Turing Prize winner Silvio Micali primarily as a platform to enable smart contracts. It has been around since 2019 and solves some of the problems that have become apparent with Ethereum and to some extent with Bitcoin. Transaction costs and costs of entry are lower with Algorand than with Ethereum, and the use of “pure-proof-of-stake” rather than Bitcoin’s “proof of work” means that it requires less computing power and therefore less energy consumption that the granddaddy of cryptos.

As you might expect with a nascent crypto, ALGO, the token associated with Algorand, has shown a lot of volatility since its launch.

It is currently trading not far off its all-time highs, but as early investors in Bitcoin will tell you, new highs at low absolute values for a crypto aren’t necessarily a reason to hold off. I am not saying it will happen, of course, but there is a chance that Algorand could emerge as the dominant platform for decentralized finance, known as “DeFi”, and if that were to happen, ALGO would take off. Obviously, there is also the chance that another, even better mousetrap will be built before that happens, in which case $1.88 will look mighty expensive before too long.

That is the risk/reward calculation that always has to be made with cryptos. The potential rewards are huge, but the risk is basically a complete and total loss of your investment, something that is rare in most other assets. It is, therefore, not for the timid, nor should any one investment represent more than a small percentage of your investable funds.

That said, though, the blockchain concept is here to stay and, at some point, a platform will emerge as the leader in the smart contract and DeFi spaces. As it stands, there is a decent chance that will be Algorand, so, providing you are aware of and comfortable with the risk involved, it is definitely a crypto to consider.

*Disclaimer: As you might have guessed if you read the above, I have a long position in ALGO.

2021-10-20 15:51:27+00:00	Crypto market hits $2.6 trillion capitalisation for the first time in history	['Jordan Major']	"For the first time in history, the cryptocurrency market has surpassed the $2.6 trillion barrier in terms of market capitalisation amid Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally, which soared to new all-time highs ahead of the second day of trading for the massively popular ProShares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Indeed, the global crypto market cap has already reached $2.613 trillion, representing a 5.6% gain over the previous day. Furthermore, the overall market volume over the past 24 hours has increased to $94.75 billion, representing a 4% increase, according to the data from CoinMarketCap.com.

In addition, the entire volume in DeFi is now $12.07 billion, accounting for 12.74% of the total 24-hour volume in the cryptocurrency market. In contrast, the volume of all stable currencies is currently $71.81 billion, representing 75.78%.

Bitcoin sets new all-time high

Moreover, Bitcoin has helped the crypto market break through the $2.6 trillion level in terms of market capitalisation for the first time ever as the flagship digital asset hit a new all-time high on October 20, 2021, following the success of ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF trading on the stock exchange for the second day in a row.

Indeed, after a spectacular comeback from a July collapse that saw the asset fall below $30,000, the cryptocurrency has reached a new all-time high propelling the BTC into the realm of price discovery.

Consequently, BTC price movement has re-entered unknown territory after breaking over the last barrier of $64,900 set April 14, 2021. Currently, the flagship digital currency is up 7.76% in the last 24 hours and 19.56% over the previous seven days, with Bitcoin now trading above $66,800 at the time of publication.

MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor commented:

“Don’t bet against #Bitcoin.”

Meanwhile, renowned pseudonymous crypto trader PlanB simply tweeted:

Notably, Bitcoin appears to be following the traders stock-2-flow chart, which he earlier tweeted about back in June.

Bitcoin is below $34K, triggered by Elon Musk's energy FUD and China's mining crack down.



There is also a more fundamental reason that we see weakness in June, and possibly July. My worst case scenario for 2021 (price/on-chain based): Aug>47K, Sep>43K, Oct>63K, Nov>98K, Dec>135K pic.twitter.com/hDONOVgxH1 — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) June 20, 2021

SHIB fails to capitalise on current market momentum

Meanwhile, decentralized token Shiba Inu (SHIB), despite being the most used non-stablecoin on the Ethereum (ETH) network, is currently changing hands at $0.00002763

down 2.4% in the last 24 hours and 5.65% over the previous seven days.

However, this is particularly notable given the fact that, apart from stablecoins, every other currency in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation is now trading in the green."

With an aim to find a cheap energy source to mine Bitcoin, a mining operation in central New York came up with a solution to use its own power plant. However, it has alarmed environmentalists.

2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin's slide from record highs is a warning for crypto investors	['Paul R. La Monica', 'Cnn Business']	"New York (CNN Business) Only a week ago, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $67,000. But investors have been dumping the world's most valuable cryptocurrency in favor of the new kid -- or rather, new dog -- in town: shiba inu.

The price of one bitcoin fell more than 5% Wednesday and was trading around $59,000, 12% below last week's record levels. For any other asset, like a stock or bond, a drop that steep in such a short time would be considered a market correction.

For bitcoin, it's just business as usual. Crypto investors have come to accept that bitcoin is volatile.

Despite more than 13,000 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap — ranging from dogecoin and shiba inu to more obscure tokens with even goofier names, such as Elon's Marvin, Dogelon Mars, Baby Floki Billionaire and Kitty Inu...(because cat lovers own crypto too) — bitcoin remains the dominant digital currency.

The total number of bitcoins now in circulation have a market value of $1.1 trillion. That's nearly half of the size of the entire crypto market, which is valued at $2.47 trillion."

2021-10-19 00:00:00+00:00	Love them or hate them: Cryptocurrencies are here to stay	[]	"Bitcoin has come a long way since someone or a group of someones under the name Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 about how to harness computing power around the world to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent.

Love cryptocurrencies or hate the very idea of them, they’re becoming more mainstream by the day.

Cryptocurrencies have surged so much that their total value has reached nearly $2.5 trillion, rivalling the world’s most valuable company, Apple, and have amassed more than 200 million users. At this size, it’s simply too big for the financial establishment to ignore.

Firms that cater to the world’s wealthiest families are increasingly putting some of their fortunes into crypto. Hedge funds are trading Bitcoin, which has big-name banks starting to offer them services around it. PayPal lets users buy crypto on its app, while Twitter helps people show appreciation for tweets by tipping their creators with Bitcoin.

And in the latest milestone for the industry, an easy-to-trade fund tied to Bitcoin began trading on Tuesday. Investors can buy the exchange-traded fund from ProShares through an old-school brokerage account — without having to learn what a hot or cold wallet is.

It’s all part of a movement across big businesses that see a chance to profit on the fervour around the world of crypto as a new ecosystem further builds up around it, whether they believe in it or not.

“The one thing you can say for certain is that the advent of the era of the Bitcoin ETF opens up the opportunity for Wall Street to make money on Bitcoin in a way that it hadn’t been able to previously,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “The winners in all of this are the exchanges and the asset managers and the custodians. Whether investors win or not is a big, bold question mark.”

Bitcoin has come a long way since someone or a group of someones under the name Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 about how to harness computing power around the world to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent. The price has more than doubled this year alone to roughly $62,000. It was at only $635 five years ago.

Supporters of cryptocurrencies say they offer an important benefit for any investor: a price that moves independently of the economy, rather than changing with it like so many other investments. More high-minded fans say digital assets are simply the future of finance, allowing transactions to sidestep middlemen, with fees tied to a currency that’s not beholden to any government.

Critics, meanwhile, question whether crypto is just a fad. They say it uses too much energy and point to all the stiff regulatory scrutiny around it. Last month, China declared Bitcoin transactions illegal, for example. The Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler said in August that the world of crypto doesn’t have enough investor protection and that “it’s more like the Wild West.”

That hasn’t been enough to halt the immense momentum for crypto, as it’s gone from an online curiosity to a bigger part of the cultural and corporate landscape.

In a survey by Citi Private Bank, which manages money for wealthy people at offices around the world, roughly 23 percent said they have made some investments in crypto. Another 25 percent said they are researching it.

The growing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street has created a new crop of darlings that help people buy it. Crypto trading platform Coinbase has a market value of roughly $64bn, for example, putting it on par with such established companies as Colgate-Palmolive, FedEx and Ford Motor.

In the end though, what many on Wall Street see sticking around may not be so much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but the technology that underlies them.

Called the blockchain, it allows for a public ledger that everyone can check and trust — and many expect it to lead to a wealth of innovations. It’s akin to today’s Netflix, Facebook and other services that sprung out of the infrastructure built during the boom and bust of the dot-com bubble.

JPMorgan Chase, for example, is already using blockchain technology to improve fund transfers between global banks. That’s the same JPMorgan Chase run by CEO Jamie Dimon, who said in an interview with Axios this month that Bitcoin has “got no intrinsic value”."

Crypto market touches new ATH

This gives the crypto industry a lead over some of the largest tech giants, such as Apple. Bitcoin is currently hovering over a $1 trillion market cap. As highlighted by the data, the crypto market was able to reach this peak thanks to the surge in the price of the leading digital asset.

Compared to the previous $2.55 trillion record high witnessed in May, this is a watershed moment for an industry that boasts of more than $100 billion market cap in altcoins. The industry has shown a 233 percent surge in aggregate market cap from January’s $830 billion.

Analyses comparing the crypto industry to giant companies in the world show that the total cryptocurrency market cap now stands larger than even that of the biggest companies in the world.

For instance, data from CompaniesMarketcap shows that Microsoft, an American multinational tech company famous for its software, has a market cap that stands at $2.28 trillion.

Bitcoin, a pacesetter for altcoins

Taking a more cursory look at the data, Bitcoin leads the pack with $1.18 trillion in market cap. This represents a 45 percent share of the total crypto market cap.

Interestingly, the number of altcoins that have seen their market cap exceed $1 billion have also grown to over 100 tokens.

The top 10 crypto assets by market cap alone have each of their market caps exceeding $30 billion while an average of those in the top 20 exceeds $10 billion per asset.

As of press time, the market cap of Ethereum is $458 billion, that of Binance Coin stands around $79 billion, while that of Tether and Cardano stands at $70 billion and $60 billion respectively."
2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin, Ether fall sharply amid heavy profit booking	[]	"The cryptocurrency market witnessed a decline over the past 24 hours as the value of popular virtual coins fell sharply. The reason behind the decline was heavy profit bookings by investors.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell on Wednesday to the lowest in a week and a half after reaching an all-time high. However, the popular cryptocurrency is still on track for its best month since February.

It’s price was $58,867 or 6 per cent lower than its value 24 hours ago at 3:40 pm. Bitcoin’s market capitalisation fell to $1.11 trillion and the 24-hour trading volume fell to $1.84 billion.

Tony Sycamore, analyst at Australian investment platform City Index told news agency Reuters that Bitcoin’s losses were down to traders taking profit from its recent rally.

Ether also fell sharply by nearly 4.7 per cent after gaining for more than a week. Ether remained just above $4,000 or 4.68 per cent lower than its value 24 hours ago. Ether’s market capitalisation fell to $470.38 billion and the trading volume of the past 24 hours was $1.83 billion.

Most other altcoins also fell sharply during Wednesday’s session as investors looked to book profits after the recent rally.

Commenting on the momentum, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm-based crypto investment platform, said, “Over the past 24 hours we saw the markets remaining in a range bound territory. Bitcoin fell marginally and with it, dominance also came down.”

“The coming 24 hours would likely be a positive session for the altcoins,” he added.

2021-10-14 11:33:57+00:00	2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Up 880%	['Chainalysis Team']	"This blog is a preview of our 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency report. Sign up here to download the whole thing!

We’re excited to share with you the 2021 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index. This marks the second iteration of our efforts to measure grassroots cryptocurrency adoption around the globe, after a year of huge growth for cryptocurrency markets and increased attention for the industry.

The goal of our crypto index is to provide an objective measure of which countries have the highest levels of cryptocurrency adoption. One way to do that would be to simply rank countries by transaction volume. However, that would favor only the countries with high levels of professional and institutional cryptocurrency adoption, as those market segments move the largest sums of cryptocurrency. While the professional and institutional markets are crucial, we want to highlight the countries with the greatest cryptocurrency adoption by ordinary people, and focus on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation.

Below, we’ll explain the index’s methodology and how it’s changed compared to last year before showing you the top ranked countries for cryptocurrency adoption, as well as a few trends we found interesting.

Our methodology

The Global Crypto Adoption Index is made up of three metrics, which we’ll explain in detail below. We rank all 154 countries according to each of those three metrics, take the geometric mean of each country’s ranking in all three, and then normalize that final number on a scale of 0 to 1 to give every country a score that determines the overall rankings. The closer the country’s final score is to 1, the higher the rank.

On-chain cryptocurrency value received, weighted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita

The goal of this metric is to rank each country by total cryptocurrency activity, but weight the rankings to favor countries where that amount is more significant based on the wealth of the average person and value of money generally within the country.

We calculate the metric by estimating total cryptocurrency received by that country, and weighting the on-chain value based on PPP per capita, which is a measure of the country’s wealth per resident. The higher the ratio of on-chain value received to PPP per capita, the higher the ranking, meaning that if two countries had equal cryptocurrency value received, the country with the lower PPP per capita would rank ahead.

On-chain retail value transferred, weighted by PPP per capita

The goal of this metric is to measure the activity of non-professional, individual cryptocurrency users, based on how much cryptocurrency they’re transacting compared to the wealth of the average person. We approximate individuals’ cryptocurrency activity by measuring the amount of cryptocurrency moved in retail transactions, which we designate as any transaction for under $10,000 USD worth of cryptocurrency. We then rank each country according to this metric but weight it to favor countries with a lower PPP per capita.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, weighted by PPP per capita and number of internet users

P2P trade volume makes up a significant percentage of all cryptocurrency activity, especially in emerging markets. For this index, we rank countries by their P2P trade volume and weight it to favor countries with lower PPP per capita and fewer internet users, the goal being to highlight countries where more residents are putting a larger share of their overall wealth into P2P cryptocurrency transactions.

How our methodology changed in 2021

The biggest change to our methodology this year was the elimination of a fourth metric that contributed to each country’s overall ranking in 2020: Number of deposits by country weighted by number of internet users.

We initially used this as a metric to determine which countries’ residents are carrying out the most cryptocurrency transactions, as this would capture both the number of individuals using cryptocurrency and boost countries whose residents are carrying out more transactions per user. However, while cryptocurrency deposits to centralized services like exchanges show up on-chain, any transactions within those services, such as trades within an exchange, aren’t captured on-chain, and only show up in those services’ order books, which we have limited or even no access to in some cases.

This isn’t the case for DeFi though. Transactions carried out by DeFi protocol users all show up on-chain, as no centralized service ever takes custody of users’ digital assets. That skewed our rankings toward countries with comparatively more DeFi users. Therefore, after reviewing the rankings both with and without this component, we decided to eliminate it. We also decided to create a new DeFi Adoption Index, which will be available in the coming weeks.

We’re confident in our index methodology and the modifications we made to it this year, though as with any standardized measure of regional economic activity, there are limitations. Since we rely on web traffic data, usage of VPNs and other products that mask online activity would compromise our ability to accurately assign activity to a country. However, our index takes into account hundreds of millions of transactions, so VPN usage would need to be quite widespread in order to meaningfully affect the data. Experts we spoke to agreed that the index matched their perception of the cryptocurrency market, giving us more confidence in the methodology. We look forward to continuing to tweak the index methodology to ensure that our rankings accommodate evolutions in the market and get more accurate over time.

The 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20

The table below shows the top 20 countries in our 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, as well as their rankings in the three component metrics that make up the overall rankings.

Three key trends jumped out to us as significant.

Global cryptocurrency adoption is skyrocketing

Our data shows that residents of more and more countries around the world are taking the dive into cryptocurrency or seeing existing adoption increase. In the chart below, we applied our index methodology globally by adding up all 154 countries’ index scores — made up of the three components we describe above — for each quarter from Q2 2019 to the present.

At the end of Q2 2020, following a period of little growth, total global adoption stood at 2.5 based on our summed up country index scores. At the end of Q2 2021, that total score stands at 24, suggesting that global adoption has grown by over 2300% since Q3 2019 and over 881% in the last year. Our research suggests that reasons for this increased adoption differ around the world — in emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions, while adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment. In a year when cryptocurrency prices rose dramatically, each region’s respective reasons to embrace the asset class seem to have proven compelling.

Adoption in emerging markets grows, powered by P2P platforms

Several countries in emerging markets, including Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam, and Venezuela rank high on our crypto index in large part because they have huge transaction volumes on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms when adjusted for PPP per capita and internet-using population. Our interviews with experts in these countries revealed that many residents use P2P cryptocurrency exchanges as their primary on-ramp into cryptocurrency, often because they don’t have access to centralized exchanges.

Knowing that, it’s no surprise that regions with many emergent markets account for a huge portion of web traffic to P2P services’ websites.

Central and Southern Asia, Latin America, and Africa send more web traffic to P2P platforms than regions whose countries tend to have larger economies, such as Western Europe and Eastern Asia.

Many emerging markets face significant currency devaluation, driving residents to buy cryptocurrency on P2P platforms in order to preserve their savings. Others in these areas use cryptocurrency to carry out international transactions, either for individual remittances or for commercial use cases, such as purchasing goods to import and sell. Many emerging markets represented here limit the amount of the national currency that residents can move out of the country. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins give those residents a way to circumvent those limits to meet their financial needs.

This contributes to an interesting dynamic whereby P2P platforms have a greater share of total transaction volume made up of smaller, retail-sized payments under $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency.

That makes sense given the use cases we described, as remittance payments and personal and commercial transactions carried out by merchants in emerging markets are likely to be smaller than transactions carried out by professional traders or institutional investors.

China and the U.S. dip in our rankings

Last year, China ranked fourth on our global adoption index while the U.S. ranked sixth. This year, the U.S. ranks eighth while China ranks 13th. The biggest reason both countries dropped is that their rankings in P2P trade volume weighted for internet-using population declined dramatically — China fell from 53rd in this component to 155th, while the U.S. fell from 16th to 109th.

Further analysis shows how far P2P volumes have fallen in the two countries compared to worldwide volumes. We show this in the index chart below, which shows relative change in P2P volumes for the U.S. and China compared to worldwide totals.

P2P transaction volume for the U.S. and China moved roughly in line with the worldwide total until they began to diverge around June 2020. At that point, the U.S. and China see their P2P transaction volume shrink as the rest of the world grows. While all three dip dramatically beginning in March 2021, the U.S. and China dip more and remain lower than worldwide totals. This activity may reflect increasing professionalization and institutionalization of cryptocurrency trading in the United States, and in China’s case may be related to ongoing government crackdowns on cryptocurrency trading.

What will drive the next wave of adoption?

Our data shows that growing transaction volume for centralized services and the explosive growth of DeFi are driving cryptocurrency usage in the developed world and in countries that already had substantial adoption, while P2P platforms are driving new adoption in emerging markets. Our biggest question for the next twelve months is how much adoption will continue on those platform categories compared to new and emerging models we haven’t seen yet. The clear takeaway though is this: Cryptocurrency adoption has skyrocketed in the last twelve months, and the variation in the countries contributing to that show that cryptocurrency is a truly global phenomenon.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency on the scene and since its creation, it has dominated the crypto market. Despite the development of other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin continues to fly ahead, leading the market by a huge margin. Why are altcoins such as ethereum, Cardano and Binance Coin failing to catch up?

Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralised cryptocurrency, it was launched by an anonymous group of programmers back in 2009. The last decade may have seen a flurry of new altcoins being launched onto the crypto scene, but bitcoin has continued to be the largest player on the market. René Pomassl, CEO of Salamantex told Express.co.uk bitcoin’s advantage of being the first on the scene gave it an all-important head start against other cryptocurrencies. He said: “This means that although thousands of cryptocurrencies are now in circulation, none have had as much time to draw in as much recognition and coverage as Bitcoin.” READ MORE: Bitcoin price latest: BTC SOARS but will its value surpass Apple?

Bitcoin continues to be the most popular and well-known crypto on the market, with investors choosing to invest in bitcoin rather than in less well-known altcoins. Jeremy Cheah Associate Professor in Crypto-Finance and Digital Investment at Nottingham Business School told Express.co.uk: “In time, some cryptos might catch up as those cryptos gain popularity and become better understood.” But in the short term, it seems unlikely that altcoins will be able to close the gap between themselves and bitcoin. Bitcoin’s current price stands at £40,521.45 as recorded by Coinbase on October 13 at 2pm. In comparison, the second market leader is ethereum which was valued at just £2,549.81, followed by Binance with a value of £340.69.

It seems no other cryptocurrency can get anywhere close to bitcoin. The market leader continues to set the trends in the crypto market - as its price rises and falls, other altcoins usually mirror its movements.

NEW YORK (AP) — Love cryptocurrencies or hate the very idea of them, they’re becoming more mainstream by the day.

Cryptocurrencies have surged so much that their total value has reached nearly $2.5 trillion, rivaling the world’s most valuable company, Apple, and have amassed more than 200 million users. At that size, it’s simply too big for the financial establishment to ignore.

Firms that cater to the world’s wealthiest families are increasingly putting some of their fortunes into crypto. Hedge funds are trading Bitcoin, which has big-name banks starting to offer them services around it. PayPal lets users buy crypto on its app, while Twitter helps people show appreciation for tweets by tipping their creators with Bitcoin.

And in the latest milestone for the industry, an easy-to-trade fund tied to Bitcoin began trading on Tuesday. Investors can buy the exchange-traded fund from ProShares through an old-school brokerage account, without having to learn what a hot or cold wallet is.

It’s all part of a movement across big businesses that see a chance to profit on the fervor around the world of crypto, as a new ecosystem further builds up around it, whether they believe in it or not.

“The one thing you can say for certain is that the advent of the era of the Bitcoin ETF opens up the opportunity for Wall Street to make money on Bitcoin in a way that it hadn’t been able to previously,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “The winners in all of this are the exchanges and the asset managers and the custodians. Whether investors win or not is a big, bold question mark.”

Bitcoin has come a long way since someone or a group of someones under the name Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper in 2008 about how to harness computing power around the world to create a digital currency that can’t be double-spent. The price has more than doubled this year alone to roughly $62,000. It was at only $635 five years ago.

Supporters of cryptocurrencies say they offer an ultra-important benefit for any investor: something whose price moves independently of the economy, rather than tracking it like so many other investments do. More high-minded fans say digital assets are simply the future of finance, allowing transactions to sidestep middlemen and fees with a currency that’s not beholden to any government.

Critics, meanwhile, question whether crypto is just a fad, say it uses too much energy and point to all the stiff regulatory scrutiny shining on it. China last month declared Bitcoin transactions illegal, for example. The chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, said in August that the world of crypto doesn’t have enough investor protection and “it’s more like the Wild West.”

That hasn’t been enough to halt the immense momentum for crypto, as it’s gone from an online curiosity to a bigger part of the cultural and corporate landscape.

U.S. Bank earlier this month said it has begun offering a cryptocurrency custody service for big investment managers. That means it essentially holds their Bitcoin in safekeeping for them, and it expects to offer support for other coins soon.

Other name-brand banks have also announced intentions to offer custodial services for crypto.

“It’s not just in the fringes and dark corners of the Web that it’s happening,” said Kashif Ahmed, president of American Private Wealth in Bedford, Massachusetts.

Ahmed doesn’t recommend his clients invest in crypto. Before then, he said he’ll need to be able to “go to my local supermarket and buy things for my family and offer crypto and not be laughed out of the store.”

But others are more willing to try it.

In a survey by Citi Private Bank of family offices around the world that manage money for wealthy people, roughly 23% said they have made some investments in crypto. Another 25% said they are researching it.

The growing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street has created a new crop of darlings that help people buy it. Crypto trading platform Coinbase has a market value of roughly $64 billion, for example, putting it on par with such established companies as Colgate-Palmolive, FedEx and Ford Motor.

At Robinhood Markets, meanwhile, the company that became famous for getting a new generation of investors into the stock market is increasingly becoming a place for crypto trading. This spring was the first time when new Robinhood customers were more likely to make their first trade in cryptocurrencies rather than in stocks.

In the end, what many on Wall Street see lasting may not be as much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the technology that underlies them.

Called the blockchain, it allows for a public ledger that everyone can check and trust, and many expect it to lead to a wealth of innovations. It’s akin to today’s Netflix, Facebook and other services that sprung out of the infrastructure built during the boom and bust of the dot-com bubble.

“The applications built on this new software architecture appear to be growing more quickly than past technologies,” Bank of America strategists Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote in a recent research report positing digital assets are only in their first inning of growth. “New companies are likely to emerge and poorly positioned companies will exit, creating significant upside potential for some and downside for others.”

JPMorgan Chase, for example, is already using blockchain technology to improve fund transfers between global banks. That’s the same JPMorgan Chase run by CEO Jamie Dimon, who said in an interview with Axios this month that bitcoin has “got no intrinsic value.”"

Q: What is cryptocurrency? (If you see phrases you don't understand, check the glossary at the bottom of this article)

Cryptocurrency is like regular currency, but completely digital.

Cryptocurrency comes in many forms, intentions, and uses. The simplest way to look at cryptocurrency is a form of stored value (money) that is not beholden to governments or central agencies like banks, states, or companies. All records of its creation and when it's sent or received are stored in a sort of big digital book that anyone can access, keeping it honest. It can't (easily) be stolen or seized and can be used anywhere in the world.

Cryptocurrencies make it possible to lend, sell, buy, or borrow without an identity, credit score, or even a bank!

Some coins are used to transfer value (measured in a currency like dollars) cheaper and faster than using credit or conventional means. Meaning the cost to send someone crypto, which can be converted into regular currency, is cheaper than something like a check or wire transfer.

Others are the only form of payment, or value, that are accepted on exchanges or in software like video games. This is what made crypto very popular years ago on the dark web to purchase drugs or other illegal things through the internet. Instead of giving a drug dealer $20 USD for some drugs, a person would send that amount of USD value in the chosen crypto (usually bitcoin) directly from your crypto wallet to theirs.

However crypto is NOT just for illegal purposes. In fact, due chiefly to its price fluctuation and other reasons it has fallen out of favor on the black market.

In-depth explanation: A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data (1's and 0's) which is designed to work as a medium of exchange.

This sounds complicated but even dollar bills all have serial numbers to verify them and keep a record. It's the same with cryptocurrency. They can also all be divided into smaller pieces similar to how USD can be divided into pennies.

Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of coins, and verify the transfer of coins between people.

Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. However, it can be and many governments are working to create a crypto coin version of its respective fiat currency.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is considered centralized. When created with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through what is called distributed ledger technology. Which is typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

Bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. However, since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created with different uses and intentions.

Some tokens are exchanged directly for troy ounces of gold or make up digital art and certificates like NFT's, but that's all too complicated and advanced for a beginner to worry about. Wait to get into that part of crypto until you're familiar with the overall market and culture.

Q: What cryptocurrencies should I know about and why is it making people rich?

You've no doubt heard of Bitcoin and Dogecoin. This is primarily because the two coins went from being worth pennies to way, way more than that in a short amount of time. These coins are among two of the most popular for internet users because they are well known, and lots of people are invested in them. Which means they get the most memes and articles created about them.

This does not mean they are necessarily the best form of crypto overall or necessarily have the most inherent value. They are just the most popular, which in the crypto world, is sort of what gives them value. There are actually thousands of cryptocurrencies just like there are thousands of currencies used in countries across the world.

Some people have become very wealthy because cryptocurrencies fluctuate in value like a stock. In 2010 Bitcoin was worth pennies on the dollar when it first came out and now averages around $60,000 per coin. Demand for Bitcoin is going up and its supply is going down, basic economics dictates that its value increases as a result.

However, they also fall in value almost as quickly as they go up which is what attracts day traders to crypto. Crypto gains are also taxed like capital gains similar to regular stocks. So if you use an exchange you'll be taxed since they will report that to the IRS. However, there is a loophole when you pay directly with crypto from one wallet to another so... do with that what you will.

Above is an example of how much the price can fluctuate just in one day. Bitcoin went from 65k in the morning to 62k by midday. So you have to be comfortable making or losing up to several thousand dollars EVERYDAY.

Popular coins explained:

Bitcoin- Introduced in 2009 Created by ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" (Real name and identity unknown)

The world’s first successful cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that users can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank. There is a finite supply, only 21 million bitcoins can be produced as designed by the creator.

The Bitcoin blockchain is a full record of the network’s history validated by individuals running the Bitcoin software (nodes). This ensures that unlike most digital data, which can be freely copied and modified, bitcoins cannot be. Because bitcoins are scarce, divisible, and transferable; bitcoins are used as money.

DOGECOIN- Introduced in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and later Billy Markus

Dogecoin is a digital currency like bitcoin or ethereum. The coin was started as a joke, intended to be a satirical take on bitcoin based on a popular dog meme. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to be scarce, Dogecoin was created to have many coins. There is about 130 billion DOGE. Miners produce around 10,000 every minute.

That high amount is a key part of the idea. Dogecoin was created as a low-stakes Bitcoin alternative. When it was launched in late 2013, it began attracting a big online community.

Ethereum-Launched in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin

The decentralized Ethereum network makes it possible to create and run applications, smart contracts, and other transactions on the network. Ethereum is different from Bitcoin in that the network can perform computations as part of the mining process. People use what's called Ether as a digital currency in financial transactions, as an investment, or as a store of value. Ethereum is the blockchain network on which Ether is held and exchanged.

Litecoin- Introduced in 2011 Created by Charlie Lee

Litecoin is unique from Bitcoin in that it can produce a greater number of coins and its transaction speed is faster. The creators say it was intended to be a lighter version of Bitcoin. Litecoin can accommodate 84 million coins compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. Litecoin was founded with the goal of prioritizing transaction speed and that's what attracts many people to the coin. As of October 2021, the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is around $1.2 trillion, making its market cap much larger than Litecoin, which has a total value of around $14.5 billion.

Stellar Lumen (XLM)- Introduced in 2015 Created by Jed McCaleb

Stellar is a decentralized computer network that operates using blockchain technology. On the Stellar network, you can trade its form of currency, which is called XLM. The creators say Stellar was designed to reduce transaction costs and serve as a bridge between fiat, digital and other currencies. The intended purpose of Stellar is to connect financial institutions via the blockchain and provide cheap transactions in developing markets. According to Stellar’s website, there are 50 billion lumens in circulation. Stellar will not produce any more lumens, so they cannot be mined.

There are many, many more cryptocurrencies but the top 25 are the most important to know at the start. Remember, there is more to cryptocurrency than just Bitcoin.

Q: How do I get into cryptocurrency?

The easiest way to start buying and holding cryptocurrency would be with an exchange. There are several popular ones and you can use them right on your smartphone. This allows holders to buy, sell, and store their crypto on their phone or on a computer.

All you need is to download the app and enter your info and connect to a bank account. After that, you can trade instantly, but be careful, you might get addicted and start checking it all the time...

Any amount of money is enough to get started because you can buy slivers of a coin, it doesn't need to be a whole coin. However, experts agree it's best to invest at least $100 across a few different coins to start.

Before making any investment decisions, please consult with financial planners and experts.

Exchanges:

Robinhood.com

Robinhood allows users to trade stocks and several cryptocurrencies. Also, Robinhood will give you a free stock for joining.

Coinbase.com

Coinbase is one of the largest and most user-friendly apps dedicated to cryptocurrency. Follow this link to start and you'll get 10% of your first $100 invested paid back in Bitcoin.

For the more advanced, there are ""wallet"" apps that can be downloaded. This would mean the coins are held on your device in the storage drive, or in a virtual wallet. Users can access this wallet with a unique code.

Examples include Coinbase wallet or Webull which doubles as an exchange.

When buying, experts agree its best to stick to the top 100 cryptocurrencies as they are relatively low risk and are quality projects. Anything under the top 200 is just gambling as most of the quality projects are already created and in the top 100.

Conclusion:

This is by no means all there is to know about crypto. However, this should be a great jumping-off point to learn more. More advanced topics include how crypto and the systems they are used with could replace all currencies, middlemen, and even governments.

Glossary:

Altseason- A trend of significant increases in the value of altcoins across altcoin markets.



A trend of significant increases in the value of altcoins across altcoin markets. Altcoins- Tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other types of digital assets that are not bitcoin are collectively known as alternative cryptocurrencies. The term is also commonly used to describe coins and tokens created after bitcoin.



Tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other types of digital assets that are not bitcoin are collectively known as alternative cryptocurrencies. The term is also commonly used to describe coins and tokens created after bitcoin. Blockchain - A growing list of records, called blocks , that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

Fiat currency- Fiat currencies are a medium of exchange established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have intrinsic value and does not have use value. It has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.

Ledger- A book or collection of accounts in which account transactions are recorded.



A book or collection of accounts in which account transactions are recorded. Medium of exchange- In economics, a medium of exchange is any item that is widely accepted in exchange for goods and services. In modern economies, the most commonly used medium of exchange is currency.

Meme- An idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. But on the internet its usually pictures or graphics with funny things written on them

Stored Value- A store of value is any commodity or asset that would normally retain purchasing power into the future and is the function of the asset that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. The most common store of value in modern times has been money, currency, or a commodity like a precious metal or financial capital. However, things like cows and rare comic books could also be a store of value.

2021-10-04 15:09:00+00:00	Cryptocurrency News - September 2021	['Aaron Mulgrew']	We start with the US Treasury sanctioning the cryptocurrency exchange SUEX for aiding ransomware developers [2]. SUEX is a Russian, invitation only platform. Large transactions could be completed physically within their offices in Moscow, which is a departure from the usual online only service that exchanges usually offer. It’s believed that this is to rule out foreign nationals from being able to use the platform effectively. This is a result of the US Treasury working with the FBI and agencies to help combat the fight against Ransomware, by ensuring that criminals cannot exchange their cryptocurrencies back into regular fiat money, effectively making the results of the attack worthless. It is believed that the SUEX exchange is the first of many causalities in the war against Ransomware which Biden declared after large scale incidents such as the Colonial Pipeline attack. The CEO of the Tehran Stock Exchange has been forced to step down after confirmation of a Bitcoin mining operation within the basement of the stock exchange itself [3]. Cryptocurrency mining in Iran has been illegal since the end of May [4], due to regular electricity blackouts (Cryptocurrency mining en masse puts huge strains on the electricity grid) and is due to be lifted at the end of September, but it appears that the illegal operation took place throughout the period in which mining is illegal throughout Iran.

2021-10-17 13:00:09.217000+00:00	Why the ‘Big Short’ Guys Think Bitcoin Is a Bubble	['Michelle Celarier']	"Michael Burry (as played by Christian Bale in The Big Short) believes bitcoin will crash. To date though, it just keeps going up. Photo-Illustration: Konstantin Sergeyev/Intelligencer. Photos: Paramount Pictures; Getty Images

During the past year of COVID-induced market mania, cryptocurrencies have gone up so much — bitcoin is up about fivefold, while many other crypto projects are up far, far more — that even reluctant Wall Street institutions have begun to tiptoe into the arena. A blazing rally that began this month has helped bitcoin shoot up nearly 50 percent in two weeks. It was driven by various pieces of news — for instance, George Soros’s family office disclosed that it holds some — but the biggest force was the increasingly certain expectation that the federal government will approve the first bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund, which will allow retail investors to buy in more easily, including for 401(k) accounts. (The ETF could begin trading as early as Monday.) But doubters remain — and their ranks just happen to include many of the same prominent investors who saw the financial crisis of 2008 coming.

Hedge-fund mogul John Paulson, who was behind the “the greatest trade ever” — in 2007, he personally made $4 billion on his short of subprime mortgages — thinks cryptocurrencies are a bubble that will prove to be “worthless.” Michael Burry, the quirky hedge-fund manager made famous in The Big Short movie (played by Christian Bale), complains that no one is paying attention to crypto’s leverage. For months, he has been suggesting that bitcoin is on the precipice of collapse. And NYU professor Nassim Taleb, whose now-canonical book The Black Swan warned about the dangers of unpredictable events just ahead of the subprime crash, argues that bitcoin is functionally a Ponzi scheme.

Other famous critics include economist Nouriel Roubini, one of the few in his profession to predict the financial crisis, and hedge-fund billionaire and hard-money acolyte Paul Singer, whose speech at a prestigious investment conference in 2006 described the eventual “wipeout” of mortgage securities.

Singer, the founder of the $48 billion investment firm Elliott Management, thinks cryptocurrencies are a fraud, but is apparently tired of complaining about them. “Pulling out your hair is an option, though only if you have hair to spare,” the balding 77-year-old Singer wrote in his first-quarter letter to investors this year. “We continue to press on for the day when we can say, ‘We told you so.’”

Since then, though, the bitcoin bulls have only grown more optimistic. Despite a steep sell-off in May and the growing certainty that the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Treasury, and even the Department of Justice are getting ready to clamp down on the cryptocurrency world, retail and institutional investors alike have kept buying. When China announced on September 24 that it would ban all cryptocurrency activities, bitcoin fell less than 6 percent.The total value of all cryptocurrencies is now estimated at $2.5 trillion, and a single bitcoin trades for around $60,000 (up from a low of around $4,000 during the broader market crash in March of last year).

Cryptocurrency investors have also been largely unfazed by the fact that, in the case of bitcoin, the term “currency” is something of a misnomer. “Nothing is priced in bitcoin,” Roubini noted in a recent Goldman Sachs research report. While Starbucks might offer customers the option of buying their coffee with bitcoin, no one actually chooses to do so.

But one of the crypto world’s most powerful and influential investors has a theory on why 2008 Cassandras — Burry in particular — only see gloom and doom ahead for bitcoin. Zhu Su, founder of Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital, tweeted earlier this month: “The desire to be consistent with oneself is the source of poor decision-making. The winners of the Big Short came to define themselves as bears and proceeded to underperform everyone for 13 years. There’s never a need to define yourself. The market does not care who you are.” He tagged Burry in the thread. A few days later, he opined: “22yo old Burry would be max long Bitcoin imho. Age changes a man, and if he’s not careful, cringes him.” (In other words, these are just old guys who can’t help fighting the glorious last war.)

It was, in part, a response to Burry musing on Twitter about actually going short on bitcoin — that is, making a real-life financial bet that it will go down, rather than just talking about it. The fact is that most bears — including the ones quoted here — aren’t actually shorting bitcoin, even as they predict its demise. In a Bloomberg interview, Paulson noted that unlike his lucrative “big short” trade, cryptocurrencies are too volatile and risky to make them a good short.

It’s undeniable that bitcoin pessimism has been costly (at very least in opportunity terms) over the past decade, making it easy to dismiss the naysayers for spreading “FUD” — or “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” But Mike Green, a prominent investment strategist who was also short subprime before the financial crisis, when he worked at hedge fund Canyon Capital, nonetheless shares the perspective of his fellow ’08 Cassandras. “These guys tend to be good b.s. sniffers,” he says. “My view is that bitcoin will ultimately end up going to zero. And I think we are in the final stages right now.”

Green says he began looking into bitcoin because clients were clamoring to invest in it. “As I dug into the actual underpinnings, it just became very clear that what was actually going on was cultlike behavior with no real understanding of the asset or the economic implications for the model that it was proposing,” he says.

Bitcoin, of course, was born of the Great Financial Crisis and the beginnings of an erosion of trust in Wall Street and monetary authorities. The first block of the now 12-year-old blockchain encodes mention of a news story about bank bailouts. The once-niche and -derisive term “fiat currency” — money issued by central bank fiat rather than, say, mined out of the ground as gold was — has, rather remarkably, gone mainstream as bitcoin and the worldview that inspired it have taken root in the public imagination.

“What’s the value, what’s the purpose of bitcoin? To take away the Fed?” asks one outspoken short seller, who wanted to remain anonymous, because “I don’t need the bitcoin guys after me.”

“I kind of like to have the Fed run by Ph.D.’s who went to work for the government being the people deciding fiscal policy more than a bunch of kids,” he says, referring to the generation of extremely online young people who have figured prominently among the early adopters of bitcoin. “And the U.S. dollar is backed by the full faith of the United States. Does bitcoin have an army?”

“It’s just a big scheme,” he says, “and so intellectually wrong.”

In recent days, hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, joined the chorus of critics, calling cryptocurrency a “jihadist call” against the dollar. “What a crazy concept this is that we as a country embrace so many bright, young, talented people to come up with a replacement for our reserve currency,” he said at the Economic Club of Chicago.

Bitcoin, its critics like to say, is nothing but electricity. “To tell me that something that’s constructed as a computer program, where you engage in some process of sitting there in front of your computer and, after a period of time and the expenditure of a bunch of electricity, a message appears on your screen that you have created something, that’s ridiculous,” Singer said on an investment podcast earlier this year. “It’s nothing.”

As Roubini put it in the Goldman report, “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no income or utility, so there’s just no way to arrive at a fundamental value.” He also scoffs at those who call it digital gold. “Bitcoin could disappear one day, but gold won’t.”

Bitcoin’s advocates tout it as an inflation hedge — but the jury remains out on that question. In practice, it has been heavily correlated to the stock market, if a lot more volatile (going up more on good days and down more on bad ones). While bitcoin has lately showed some ability to move independently of the S&P 500, posting gains even when the market declined, critics still see it behaving more like a meme stock than an established asset class.

“Crypto people think it’s an antidote to central-bank bubbles, but it has actually become a symptom,” says Mark Spitznagel, founder of Universa Investments, a hedge fund that made headlines by producing eye-popping gains during the COVID crash last year. Spitznagel, also a fervent critic of the Fed’s monetary policies post-crash, says cryptocurrencies themselves are fiat currencies, because they are “created out of thin air.”

“People buy it thinking that the next guy will come along and subjectively value it higher,” he says. “That looks like a Ponzi scheme.”

The core element of any pro-bitcoin argument is decentralization and transparency, but Roubini has asserted that an “oligopoly of miners” control bitcoin, pointing to the prevalence of countries like China and, to a much lesser extent, Russia and Iran, in crypto-mining. The strength of this argument may be waning though. Until recently, China accounted for more than 50 percent of all mining, but it’s unclear how much — if any — of that capacity remains online now that the central government has banned the industry. In practice, much of it seems to be moving to the United States, particularly Texas.

The question of illicit transactions and money-laundering does still hang heavy over bitcoin, referenced often by financial authorities as a cause for concern. Green estimates that 40 percent of bitcoin’s real-world transactions are still criminal in nature (don’t forget, the first killer app was black-market bazaar Silk Road), including recent ransomware hackings. Bulls argue that the real number is a lot lower. A report by industry firm Chainalysis pegged it at less than one percent in 2020 — less than than comparable figures for cash.

Similar questions and uncertainty swirl around the decision by El Salvador to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. “I would broadly describe what’s going on with El Salvador as they’re trying to make money-laundering the national business,” says Green, who contends that El Salvador is at risk of becoming a narco state.

Bitcoin bears say crypto’s transparency is also overstated. To be sure, every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, a digital ledger that has been highly touted for potential broader use. But that doesn’t mean the market is transparent. If cryptocurrency were truly transparent, it might be possible to know how much leverage is currently in use in crypto markets. The Economist recently calculated that “90 percent of the money invested in bitcoin is spent on derivatives like ‘perpetual’ swaps — bets on future price fluctuations that never expire. Most of these are traded on unregulated exchanges … from which customers borrow to make bets even bigger.”

No one knows what the actual leverage is, says Green, who adds that some of the trading is simply fake buy-and-sell orders, known as “wash sales,” that give the illusion of activity.

The leverage could kill it, Michael Burry argued in a series of tweets that have since been deleted. “If you don’t know how much leverage is in crypto, you don’t know anything about crypto, no matter how much else you think you know,” he tweeted in June, saying its collapse will trigger “the mother of all crashes.” He likens it to the dot-com bubble of 1999 and the housing one of 2007.

Crypto mania is “the perfect love child” of those two predecessors, says Josh Wolfe, who lived through both eras on Wall Street and is the co-founder of venture-capital firm Lux Capital. The cryptocurrency world contains both the technological innovation of the dot-com boom and bust and the leverage associated with the housing bubble’s complex securitization, as well as its evasion of regulation. (As much as he abhors cryptocurrency promoters and pumpers — of which there are many — Wolfe argues the innovative blockchain infrastructure will survive.)

One of the longest-running bearish narratives around bitcoin concerns Tether, the Hong Kong–based stablecoin — the idea is that one Tether is always worth a dollar — with more than $68 billion of tokens now in circulation. Stablecoins are supposed to be backed by riskless assets, as they act to grease the wheels of crypto-trading exchanges around the globe. But regulators and investors alike have long worried about the quality of Tether’s collateral, and whether the project might not be prone to collapse. (Bloomberg reported recently that some of Tether’s reserves might be held in Chinese commercial paper — a particularly dicey asset class at the moment, following the implosion of real-estate giant Evergrande.)

The U.S. government is now trying to figure out how best to regulate stablecoins and their potential impact on the broader financial system. Gensler, for example, has called them “poker chips” and says they should be considered securities that the SEC could oversee. If left unregulated, he said at a recent conference, cryptocurrency markets “will not end well.” The Treasury Department is also considering regulating Tether — which is under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice — like a bank, as it has been used to avoid both money-laundering rules and taxes.

Lack of regulation, however, is the point of the free-market world of cryptocurrency, says Green. He notes that the venture capitalists who’ve dreamed up many of the new tokens and exchanges come from a culture that created popular new businesses, like Airbnb and Uber, which thrive by avoiding the type of costly regulations that govern their established rivals. The VC world calls it disruption; Green calls it regulatory arbitrage.

The crypto world is clearly nervous about more regulation. “What could go wrong with crypto? Well, what could go wrong is we could have some really crappy regulation, which will slow things,” Michael Novogratz, hedge-fund manager turned bitcoin pioneer who founded financial firm Galaxy Digital, told attendees at bitcoin promoter Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT conference in New York in September. At the same conference, hedge-fund mogul Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, who dabbles in cryptocurrencies, said he believed regulators would “kill” bitcoin if it became too successful.

Spitznagel agrees with that assessment. “I can see why governments need to fight this thing. They are probably going to shut it down at some point.” (Here, a more neutral observer might point out that bitcoin is a decentralized global network, and that one national government — or even many governments together — can’t just “shut it down.” As long as there are computers somewhere in the world running the program, bitcoin is technically alive and functioning.)

Even expectations of a China-like bitcoin ban in the United States might not be reality-based. The federal government treats bitcoin as property, and Gensler’s regulatory hawkishness has generally included exceptions for bitcoin itself. His agency is the regulatory authority that seems ready to let a bitcoin-futures ETF begin trading on a U.S. exchange next week. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said recently before Congress that he did not intend to ban it.

Meanwhile, flush with cash, the new crypto industry is busy lobbying Congress to thwart any new regulations, including efforts to tax crypto, and has drawn mostly Republicans to its side.

Beyond all the specific arguments and counterarguments, the fact remains that those from the “big short” set making the case against bitcoin are generally not making the same kind of real-life short bets that made them so much money in 2008. Whether that is the real tell here or just an oddity of this particular bubble remains to be seen.

“You can’t be short it in scale,” agrees the short seller. Like some of the others who fundamentally dislike it, he even has a small position in bitcoin. “If it goes up, I’ll make a little bit of money. If it goes to zero, I’ll be so happy, I will gladly lose the money.”"
2021-10-17 12:30:06+00:00	What does this development indicate for Ethereum, going forward	['Aaryamann Shrivastava']	"Ethereum has been following Bitcoin’s lead along with the entire crypto market as it rallied this month. Trading at $3914.85, the altcoin is in a good spot and the same can be observed from investors’ perspective as well. But this development could put a halt to the good mood prevailing in the market.

Ethereum on a roll

After a 30.40% rally this month, ETH managed to make things easier for its investors. At the time of writing the number of addresses in loss fell to a 1 month low of merely 2.17 million, which represents only 1% of all Ethereum investors.

In fact, investors probably even took advantage of Ethereum’s rally towards $4k and maybe sold their holdings. And these sellers weren’t regular traders either. Mid-term holders, who held ETH for 3 – 6 months, and long-term holders who held their balance for at least 2 – 3 years, sold off a majority of their holdings this month.

Mid-term holders’ supply reached a 6 month low and long-term holders’ supply fell to a 7-month low.

Surprisingly a chunk of ETH was actually picked up by whales or rich cohorts from exchanges as addresses holding more than 10k ETH rose in 48 hours. Even at just 10,000 ETH in every address, at least $4.2 billion worth of ETH was bought.

But the selling by MTH and LTH was not some random selling for profit incident. There is a strong possibility that these investors are preparing for soon to arrive price fall.

A price fall?

Indeed. The very first indication of the same comes from the market top created today as supply in profit reached 98.62%. A market top usually is followed by some price fall. In the past too (September 15), when a market top was formed, price fall followed and the same was hinted back then.

So it wouldn’t be a surprise if the same happens again. And on top of that Relative Strength Index’s current position supports the same argument. We can see that RSI is close to breaching the overbought zone for the first time this month.

But we must observe whether the RSI cooldown is accompanied by a price dip or simple consolidation.

In any case, taking precautions is always better than regretting."

Over 10,000 BTC were sold on OKEx amid the crypto market cap surge.

The digital finance world is experiencing a mix of reactions these days. However, it is worth mentioning that as of today, the global crypto market cap index has seen an upward surge of $2.5 trillion. Since the start of this year, the crypto market has risen by 233%.

In fact, this monumental increase in the crypto market cap value is quite a welcoming gesture that every crypto advocate hopes to see. Adding more to this, the trading volume of BTC/USDT pairs has also increased drastically to over 10,000 BTC sold today on the OKEx exchange.

To note, one of the on-chain analytics firm’s Wu Blockchain gave the BTC/USDT announcement today. Specifically, Wu Blockchain cited the BTC/USDT trading volume statista directly from Trading View.

Also, it mentioned that they seem to be sensing another pending 14,000 BTC sell order still on the OKEx exchange. A few minutes after disclosing this, the latter then said the pending order got away by the buy order that was also in BTC/USDT.

In the same breath, Bitcoin Magazine has also tweeted that the $38 billion Grayscale Bitcoin trust will soon be converted into ETF. This milestone would be achieved as the proposals filed to approve Bitcoin’s Future Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) is yet to be accepted.

Here are some highlights from the crypto market.

Bitcoin news

The data shows that large transactions increase as whales move their funds. This shows the maturity of Bitcoin as a macro asset class.

follow report In Glassnode’s latest weekly newspaper, large transactions are increasingly dominating the BTC network, suggesting that whales and institutional investors are showing a growing interest in the cryptocurrency.

The graph above shows that trading volume increased after a sharp drop in June and has been at a low level since then. The high trading volume shows that there is currently great interest in this coin.

There is a box on the chart that covers the trading volume from $ 13.6 billion to $ 16.8 billion. This box marks two regions of most of the trading volume where values ​​are close to the ATH level.

The difference between the two peaks becomes clear on closer inspection of the histogram. It seems that recently transactions over USD 10 million have become more and more dominant.

These big businesses include whales, institutional investors, dealing desks, and other high quality companies and funds. The rise in whales shows that Bitcoin has matured as a macro asset.

Bitcoin is targeting in the $ 320,000 and above range over the long term.

After a macro and long-term view by trader ‘Pentoshi’ who posted a chart highlighting BTC’s multi-year trading range.

According to the graph provided, the BTC price could reach as high as $ 323,216 in 2022.

Bitcoin will crash due to its extremely volatile and speculative nature.

Renowned Johns Hopkins University economist and crypto critic Steve Hanke believes Bitcoin will crash. He said the downside to Bitcoin, which will eventually bottom its price, is its “extremely volatile and speculative nature.”

Hanke believes in the universal law that assets that grow quickly must eventually decline quickly. According to his tweet, Bitcoin proves that it is no exception to this law as it is very volatile and speculative.

Meanwhile, another well-known bitcoin hater, Peter Schiff, points to possible future circumstances under which the U.S. government could impose additional regulations on BTC and all other bitcoins.

Ethereum news

According to data analytics firm Messari, the Ethereum network has processed $ 6.2 trillion in transactions in the past 12 months. What’s more impressive is that this number has increased by more than 350% compared to the last 12 months.

In the past 12 months, Ethereum has processed $ 6.2 trillion in transactions. That number is up 369% from 2020 and was fueled by a strong third quarter with Ethereum trading $ 1.5 trillion. Probably nothing. pic.twitter.com/O7Kx9OgWqF – Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) October 4, 2021

Data from analyst Ryan Watkins shows that the Ethereum economy is growing strongly. Despite the limited impact of the London upgrade, increasingly fierce competition from other smart contract platforms, and a chain split bug in late August.

However, without ignoring the above issues, many users believe that the Ethereum chain will continue to grow strongly in the future.

Whales transport large amounts of ETH.

Whale Alert has spotted dozens of large Ethereum transfers moving the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, valued at over $ 2.2 billion.

The largest transfer took place with 227,371 ETH (equivalent to 784,858,373 USD). Smaller transactions included 101,000; 60,000; 30,000 and 10,000 ETH.

2021-10-26 15:54:21+00:00	Crypto ETPs post record flows week following ProShares bitcoin ETF launch	[]	"Crypto ETPs post record flows week following ProShares bitcoin ETF launch

Cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP) inflows posted their biggest week on record after raking in $1.5bn on the back of the launch of the first futures-backed bitcoin ETF in the US.

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) alone accounted for $1.2bn of the flows after it launched on Tuesday 19 October – following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – to become the fastest ETF to break the $1bn mark in history.

This was followed by the launch of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) last Friday which saw an asset inflow of roughly $78m on its first day of trading.

Investors had been piling into bitcoin ETPs in the run-up to the SEC’s approval, recording roughly $740m in the nine weeks prior.

However, this was dwarfed by the launch of the BITO as flows smashed the previous weekly record of $640m recorded in February this year, according to data from crypto ETP issuer CoinShares.

It takes year-to-date inflows in crypto ETPs to $8bn, over 10% of the entire digital assets under management of $76.7bn.

Commenting on the flows, James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, said: “The record inflows were a direct result of the SEC allowing a bitcoin ETF investing in futures and the consequent listing of two bitcoin investment products with inflows totalling $1.2bn.”

Away from the US, bitcoin recorded inflows of $138m while CoinShares recorded outflows of $58m in its bitcoin product as investors cashed in on rising bitcoin price.

Bitcoin broke through its all-time high last week, peaking at $66,000 on Wednesday, before finishing the week 2% down at $60,600.

Ethereum continued to see outflows, with investors taking $1.4m out of the digital asset, which Butterfill said was a result of minor profit taking as the price closes in on an all-time-high.

Elsewhere, solana, cardano and binance continued to see inflows, taking in $8.1m, $5.3m and $1.8m, respectively."

Additional features

Automatic purchase

While primarily focused on spot exchanges, Coinstash does enable users to set up a recurring buy for cryptocurrency purchases. This allows investors to take advantage of the benefits of dollar-cost averaging.

Dollar-cost averaging is a popular investment technique for both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. It is implemented by purchasing predefined amounts of an asset (in this case cryptocurrencies) at regular intervals. This may be completed weekly, monthly or quarterly. The advantage of DCA is that the technique allows for completely passive investing and removes the concern of market fluctuations.

Customer support

Coinstash places a high priority on customer support. This support is provided via email, telephone, social media platforms and via the online webchat service, which can be accessed from both a computer and mobile web browser. Customer support is provided every day between 9am and 11pm.

Is Coinstash safe to use?

Regulation. CoinStash is headquartered in Brisbane, Australia, with the website being run and owned by a company called TWMT. The company is registered with AUSTRAC and is regulated by all Australian financial laws and anti-money laundering policies. The exchange is also working towards obtaining an Australian Financial Services Licence so that it can expand its list of features to Coinstash Earn, Coinstash Borrow and Coinstash Spend.

The identity check process has been made extremely simple, with IDs verified quickly by the Coinstash team. Security features. Like all good cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinstash places a high priority on security. The exchange encourages the use of 2-factor authentication (2FA), which means a secondary time-sensitive 6-digit code must be entered for account access. This is usually generated by a third-party application, such as Google Authenticator. This process is now best practice within the cryptocurrency industry. The exchange also implements secure SSO encryption. While the exchange is safe for cryptocurrency storage, it is always advisable to keep large sums of cryptocurrency assets within a personal cryptocurrency wallet.

Verdict

For investors looking for a simple, easy to use, spot cryptocurrency exchange, CoinStash will tick a lot of the boxes. Thanks to its niche Australian market it is able to offer market-leading trading fees, with no charges applied when depositing or withdrawing AUD funds. The user interface is intuitive, which makes it an ideal platform for those looking to onboard into the world of cryptocurrency.

As the exchange currently only offers spot exchanges it is not a platform suitable for experienced cryptocurrency investors. However, the exchange has strong future plans including the opportunity to earn yield on idle cryptocurrency assets, borrow funds and even use cryptocurrencies that are held on the exchange to pay for goods and services. If the exchange can implement this vision it could soon become a market-leading cryptocurrency exchange for Australian investors.

On Friday, Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) shares edged higher by 2% after announcing solid fiscal Q3 results. The company reported its most recent quarterly results before markets opened, beating analyst expectations on revenue and funds from operations (FFO). The company also boosted its guidance for FY 2021, pushing its FFO forecast ahead of expectations.

Prologis posted an FQ3 FFO per share of $1.04, slightly ahead of the consensus Street estimate of $1.03. On the other hand, revenue for the quarter grew by 9.3% Y/Y to $1.19 billion, $150 million ahead of estimates.

Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.

The company now expects to report FY2021 core diluted FFO per share of $4.11-$4.13, compared to the average Street forecast of $4.07.

Time to buy or sell PLD shares?

From an investment perspective, Prologis shares trade at a steep trailing 12-month P/E of 65.41 and a forward P/E of 64.69, making the stock less attractive to value investors. However, valuing the stock based on FFOs, PLD seems reasonably valued with a price-FFO ratio of 34.55.

Therefore, although the company’s bottom-line growth prospects are less exciting, some value investors could find it compelling after boosting FFO expectations.

Technically, Prologis shares seem to be trading within a sharply ascending channel formation. The stock recently bounced off the 100-day moving average, surging into overbought conditions of the 14-day RSI.

Therefore, with PLD shares trading at new all-time highs, the stock appears poised for an imminent pullback. As a result, investors could target potential pullback profits at about $134.12, or lower at $130.16. On the other hand, if the stock price continues to rise, it could find resistance at $142.14.

Time to short PLD shares?

In summary, although Prologis outperformed analyst expectations in its most recent quarterly results, the stock seems to have recently skyrocketed to overbought conditions, creating an opportunity for a pullback.

Therefore, given the company’s steep valuation multiples and weak growth outlook, it may be best to wait for the price to retreat towards a key support level before buying.

On Monday, Zillow Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ZG) shares declined by 9% after the company said it won’t be buying more houses after reaching capacity for the year. Zillow is pausing its property-flipping services amid a growing backlog of unrenovated homes.

The company is facing shortages of workers used to fix up the property amid rising demand for Zillow Offers. As a result, it has paused new purchases until it can find a solution for the backlog.

Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.

A Zillow spokesperson wrote in an email:

We are beyond operational capacity in our Zillow Offers business and are not taking on additional contracts to purchase homes at this time.

Investors fear the company could lose a significant share of the year-end business to its close peer, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (BMV:OPEN1).

Is it too late to sell ZG shares?

From an investment perspective, Zillow shares trade at steep trailing 12-month and forward P/E ratios of 158.22 and 78.91, respectively. As a result, value investors may opt for alternatives in the market.

However, with analysts expecting earnings to grow by more than 51% this year before rising at an average annual rate of 73.50% over the next five years, its growth prospects look exciting.

Therefore, investors willing to overlook short-term turbulence could find it as a compelling option for the portfolios.

Source – TradingView

Technically, Zillow shares seem to be trading within a descending channel formation in the intraday chart. In addition, the stock pulled back sharply on Monday, pushing the stock closer to oversold conditions.

Therefore, given ZG’s exciting growth prospects, long-term investors could choose to capitalise on the pullback by targeting profits at about $96.22, or higher at $111.77.

On the other hand, $73.32 and $55.88 are crucial support zones.

It could be time to buy

In summary, although Zillow shares trade at steep valuation multiples, its long-term growth prospects outweigh short-term risks.

Therefore, with shares pulling back sharply on Monday, it could be a perfect opportunity to invest in ZG stock.

Is it just an idea? Have you done the research, or are you in the running to start the production? We hear from Colin and Michele, who tell us their ‘ideas to action’ process and gain a fundamental understanding of how entrepreneurs all follow the same process.

The beginning

The first thing Colin does when an idea sparks to mind is head over to godaddy.com to ensure he has ownership of his idea and domain name.

Michele does in-depth research on her idea to see if the domain name is available and establishes whether the patent has already been taken.

Michele said it is critically important to pick your domain name. “Picking a name really helps you to focus on your idea.”

Following this, Michele does a scan across all social media platforms to see if her domain name is available.

Stage gates

Colin likes to set up ‘stage gates’ so that he is able to visualize a company a certain size. A type of deadline to reach, a goal to achieve, what is doable, and what is not. He said, “If I cannot reach those stage gates, I either need to pivot or get out of that business.”

Do you fall in love with company and business ideas and find yourself holding on for too long? Colin said it’s time to stop, and knowing when to let go is crucial to you preventing yourself from losing time and money; this is the benefit of stage gates.

Is the business scalable?

It is easy to get excited about something in the short term, but is your business idea longstanding? Does it have legs? Can it grow, and can you be working on this business for the next 10 to 15 years?

Michele gets hung up on her next big idea and says it is essential to recognize that it is “highly improbable” to always come up with ideas that will be successful and the next “big thing.” So, that is why considering whether a company is scalable is a beneficial tool to help you focus on building a company rather than hitting the jackpot.

Fundraising

Funding is typically one of the most difficult stages of the ‘ideas to action’ process. Colin recommends using your own personal or family money to get your idea off the ground until you can prove a concept. Once you’ve proven a concept, it’s much easier to raise funding.

There are funding opportunities within government funding schemes. Don’t be ashamed to turn to the government for a helping hand in your startup if you need to.

Facebook and Google also offer free advertising, a great way to get your foot in the door!

Crowdfunding is a whole other conversation; “crowdfunding needs a marketing engine ready to fuel your kickstart business,” said Michele.

Production

The next stage is production; how do you bring your product to fruition? If you’ve got the money and the go-ahead, what next?

Michele said figuring out “how to acquire a valued customer” is a popular way to help your micro company reach its potential. Is the market responding to your product? Is it a design flaw? What are the competitors like? How big is the market you’re trying to get into? Find out the challenges in the market and face them head-on.

Listen to the full session above and get more insights from entrepreneurs."

Laura Shin:

Today’s guest is Fereshteh Forough, founder and CEO of Code to Inspire, a coding school for girls in Afghanistan. Welcome, Ferestheh.

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah. Thank you so much, Laura, for having me.

Laura Shin:

So regular listeners to the show will remember that Fereshteh was mentioned in an interview I did with Steve Erlich of Forbes. People were interested in hearing more about her and more about real-world use cases for crypto. So Fereshteh, thank you so much for joining us, especially because world news in recent months has had a direct impact on you and your family. But before we get into those recent events, why don’t we start with your personal story as a refugee and how you became a computer science professor?

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. I was born as a refugee in Iran during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. My parents are originally from Herat, it’s a city in the west of Afghanistan, very mountainous and beautiful. It’s one of the main cities that the heart of the ancient silk road was passing through the city. So, unfortunately, my parents, the same as a lot of other people in Afghanistan had to leave the country and find a safe haven for their children. I was born in a very small town close to Iran and Afghanistan border. I grew up in a big family, eight children. I’m the fifth one. So you can imagine, I’m not the oldest and I’m not the youngest. So I kind of grew up independent and I think that’s really shaped my character. Certainly being born as a refugee, growing up as a refugee, there are a lot of issues you are facing. Not only the discriminations that you’re facing with because you’re just different. And unfortunately, sometimes people look at you as an unwanted guest and they think that you’re here to steal the opportunities from them. That makes it very difficult for you to blend into the community. Then the financial aspects of it. Being a refugee, you will be denied access to certain basic and fundamental rights in the country that you’re in, such as opening bank accounts or accessing education in the school. And that was one of the big issues that we were facing with my family. And I remember that my mom learned how to stitch and make dresses. By selling them, she could bring money to the family and she could invest in our education.

So I guess from a very early age, I learned to be an entrepreneur and how you can start great things with empty hands. And that’s what I learned from my mom. I know the value of education and how it is important. We moved to Afghanistan one year after the fall of the Taliban — when the US invaded Afghanistan in 2002 to Herat and I applied for university entrance and by chance, and randomly, I got into computer science. That was certainly not my favorite field of study. And my family really encouraged me to continue because they said it’s the future. It’s something that we think can help you a lot. And I continued studying computer science. I got my bachelor’s from Herat University, and then I received a scholarship. I went to Germany and I got my master’s in computer science from the Technical University of Berlin. Went back and taught as a computer science professor for about three years at Herat University.

So certainly I guess my life story as a refugee being denied accessing education, and as a woman studying computer science, and teaching computer science in Herat and Afghanistan, the discrimination, the backlashes I faced, the verbal and sexual harassment in the working and educational space. It made me think about how I can change the situation for women, especially in the technology sector. And that’s how it led me to establish Code to Inspire aspire as the first coding school for girls in Afghanistan, January 2015.

Laura Shin:

And tell us what Code to Inspire does.

Fereshteh Forough:

With Code to Inspire, there are three important pillars of the work. First, we provide a single-gender school, only for women and girls, so that the family feels comfortable sending their daughters to our school. Second, we offer a school for free because a lot of the girls come from a challenging financial background.

And the third, which is the most important pillar of the work, is we offer certain technical skills that can be translated either into job opportunities within the community in Afghanistan, or we can outsource projects to them. So the students can work remotely, or they can be entrepreneurs and create their own company and startups and hire more women. Since 2015, we’ve educated more than 350 students in our coding classes, such as game design, web development, mobile, and also a blockchain cryptocurrency and graphic design class. With our graduates, the data that we have, well pre-Taliban, unfortunately, since a month ago, 70% of our students found jobs within the community and they’re getting paid some of the above-average income salary, which is $150 per month in Afghanistan. We outsourced more than 40 projects worth more than $30,000 to our students. A group of our graduates, about 10% of them, they created their own startups, raised funds and hired more women. And our school gained pre-Taliban was a physical location in Herat, with full time for our students and the classes were being taught in person.

Laura Shin:

And so give us a sense of kind of what girls education and opportunities are in Afghanistan aside from this school. Like, if they don’t have this kind of opportunity, then what does that look like for them?

Fereshteh Forough:

There are certainly a lot of challenges and issues, not only right now, which is a whole different story with the Taliban taking over Afghanistan, but even in the past — infrastructure is a big issue. If you talk about big cities, still there’s a lack of buildings, staff, and teachers and resources for students, especially female schools. That lack of equipments like having laptops, internet connections, and the commute would be a big issue for the girls to leave their house, especially the ones who live far away from the school. If you leave the big cities, in surrounding areas and especially in villages, you won’t have facility for that. You may have access to primary or maybe secondary education, but you don’t have high school just because, again, the population is financially underserved. There’s not a lot of resources for them, such as schools, buildings. The families won’t feel comfortable sending their daughters to travel a long way to go to the next big city to get the education.

So the lack of resources and infrastructure really is a big issue to access equal education, especially for girls and women. And then beside that, of course, the cultural, the patriarchal society. The extremists make it very difficult for the girls to access education. Sometimes families become under the influence of the extremists and won’t let their daughter to continue education. Forced marriages, early marriages, are one of the important factors that the girl is dropped from school because once they get married, the fiance or the husband, won’t let them to continue education. And of course they gain financial issues. Not a lot of family can invest in extracurricular activities. They prefer to invest on the boys’ education because they think that the boy is going to be the future breadwinner, not the girl. So they prefer to send the boy to the school, not the girl. So these are some of the main important factors of why girls education would be very difficult, not only in cities, but also in areas outside of the city for Afghanistan.

Laura Shin:

Can you maybe give some examples of kind of what risks girls face when they do try to seek out an education?

Fereshteh Forough:

Definitely the backlash and the threats they face from either their family members or the community. A lot of times maybe the male members of the family relatives would be against the education. And if they raise their voice, they make those threats. It can be threats such as like, they hit them — violence against women. They lock them at home. Or the extreme way of like extremist burning the schools for girls. We do have incidents of extremists on the Taliban burning girl’s schools, and that makes the family feel so scared and uncomfortable to risk the lives of the girl’s to send them to school. Even like trying to do the commute from one location to another location, they may be abducted by unknown people. So these are like serious concerns that make it very difficult sometimes for families to, even if they want to send their daughters to school, won’t feel comfortable to do that.

Laura Shin:

Since founding Code to Inspire, what impact have you seen it have?

Fereshteh Forough:

There are a lot of inspiring stories of the girls who came to the school and graduated. I can say a majority of the girls who joined our coding school didn’t have access to internet connections. They didn’t have laptops, even basic phones. So they were totally living in an offline world. And with the infrastructure and equipments, we provided it for them, that was certainly life-changing. Not only looking at the educational aspects of it, but all of the financial aspects of it. These are the girls who came to school, they were so shy. They really didn’t believe in themselves. They didn’t have self-esteem. We encouraged them to build their own life around what they’re learning and be outspoken and raise their voice. No one would question them, and we see that like their self self-esteem boosted, they now have social media accounts and write about their activities.

I’ll give you one example of one of our graduates. She came to the school when she was in 10th grade and then we interviewed her and asked her why she wanted to join this coding school. And she said, I want to make money. And we were like, that’s great. There’s nothing wrong with making money. And she came from a very financial challenging background. She even couldn’t pay for the commute, but she was so motivated that we sponsored her commute, gave her a laptop to take home. And once she graduated, she was one of the top graduates. And one day she texted me and she said, you can’t believe what I say that I convinced the company that they’re all men that I can make a website for you and take your business online. And they agreed and they going to pay me $200. I was like, wow, you’re so bad-ass at such a young age to convince the companies and men to give you an opportunity. And now you are bringing money to the family, which makes you to have a voice in the family and be a part of the decision making process in the family. And we have tons of stories like that.

Laura Shin:

I was going to ask you: do you feel that the experience that the girls have, that it changes attitudes either in their family or in their communities? Or does the existence of the school in general, has that had an impact and changing attitudes?

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. When we have started a program and we were kind of like posting on our social media about our activities, a lot of people, especially men, very educated in computer science, were like, oh, that’s useless what they’re learning. They are gonna get married. They’re going to like go to the house, clean the kitchen, make babies and stuff like that. And it was so offensive because they couldn’t see that there is a path to financial freedom with what we are trying to do. And after a year or so, when we have graduates and we helped them with jobs and giving them opportunities, they brought the money to the family and some of them actually made double or triple than the men in the family. And the family couldn’t believe that the girl of the family is capable of doing something that the boy of the family is not. And they called us, they start calling us the father, the brother, the husbands came to check the school. And they said, we can’t believe. We see that she is behind the computer. She’s doing something, but we have no idea, but she’s bringing money to the family. And they started calling the relatives and other people and encourage their daughter to join in a school. And we received calls from others. So it became very organic, once people realized that there’s a value on investing in education and the gauze being able to bring money to the family.

Laura Shin:

That’s, that’s great. When you were talking earlier, it’s such a contrast if I think about growing up here in the US. There’s no question that you sent a girl to school. What you’re saying is just very eyeopening for somebody who grew up here. But one other thing I found fascinating was I have seen a video about Code to Inspire where the girls were making video games and the protagonist or the player in the game, they made it as an Afghan girl. And then the video showed that there were Afghan boys playing this game. And I just wondered how do you think things like that have also changed perceptions of girls in Afghanistan?

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. So like beside education, we also want to change the perspective of community towards girls’ education and empowerment. And we’ve been creating different games and apps that are geared towards certain problems in the community. And one of them was the Afghan Hero Girl game that you are referring to. I remember we had a brainstorming session with our students in-game class, and we were kind of like, okay, what would be the next game? And then they’re like, they’re kind of tired of seeing all these like superheroes in the game are mainly men. And then they’re just like targeting certain geographical population. There is a very few female superhero and also like from Afghanistan or from a Muslim country.

So then we’re like, okay, what about we create our own superhero? And then they created the app of Afghan Hero Girl, wearing traditional outfit and going through different stages. It was certainly an eye-opening experience for us too. We couldn’t believe that the game would have such a good feedback. I mean, we have a lot of thousands of downloads, hundreds of comments, and they’re all men giving us comments that, oh, what if you put the arrow here or what if you add this function? So like, it’s great to see that they’re engaged. When the little girls were playing that game, they’re all like, oh, I want to be a superhero like Heron. And I want to like I have that power. I think that’s very, very empowering and important in such a young age when they see a role model in a superhero that they can be that person.

Laura Shin:

So at a certain point Code to Inspire began adopting crypto. How did you guys start using it and why?

Fereshteh Forough:

With cryptocurrency, that’s interesting. I got to know about it late 2013, maybe early 2014. And that was again, because of work that I was doing with Afghanistan. Sending payments, and it was certainly a big issue.The bank system requiring a lot of paper works and it takes a lot of time and all the KYC. And of course it’s Afghanistan. So people are kind of like giving you more hard time when you deal with Afghanistan, especially I guess, for financial issues. Western Union also, we tried, but it was very costly with the fees that we were having to pay. And those fees for a lot. $10 to $15 would be covering a family for a couple of days to have food on your table. And then PayPal is not operating in Afghanistan. So that was also like not an option for us.

And a lot of the people who were sending money, the girls, were underage, so they didn’t have a bank account. So these issues were very time consuming. Dealing with a lot of paperwork. And it was frustrating at some point. And that’s how I learned about cryptocurrency and at that time, of course, Bitcoin, and how fascinating is the technology. It’s very fast without any third party and so secure, it can just like send directly money to the girls and they can have it. And since then, I got to know more about the technology itself and then how we can help the girls. And we started sending crypto to Afghanistan. And then with Code to Inspire, particularly, we started teaching blockchain technologies, smart contracts, solidity, decentralized apps to our students.

And actually, as of this week, five of our students are part of the ConsenSys Academy, which is very exciting. So hopefully they will finish the course and it will be a great experience for them. And then with the organization itself, we do accept crypto as a donation since 2015. I can say probably we are one of the very early organization who accepted crypto as a donation, but also keep holding it. So that hopefully down the road we can use it for more powerful and like help more population in Afghanistan. And then also sending. Since January, we used to send on and off, but since this January, we only are sending crypto to Afghanistan for our monthly operation. Also, for the care package cash assistance that we are helping our students who are losing jobs and their family. So it’s amazing. It’s unbelievable how this technology can help in such a critical moment where the banks are closed, the Western Union has limited services, and nothing is working in Afghanistan. We are probably, again, one of the very only organizations and people who are using it in such a larger scale.

Laura Shin:

Wow. So I have so many questions about this. But initially when you started describing how you first began using crypto, was that to make payments to the girls for gigs that they did? Or was it to fund your operations, like accepting donations? What was that initial purpose for using the crypto at that time?

Fereshteh Forough:

A combination of both, but mainly for the girls who were using worked for the remote work and we wanted to like send them quicker to that.

Laura Shin:

Oh, I see. And so then once you received that money, and I’m sure this has changed over time, but how are you turning that into Afghanis, which is the local currency?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah, that’s a great question. It was so difficult at the beginning because. At the beginning to kind of had to like act as an exchange ourselves because no one knew about it. So if you send crypto to the girls and they wanted to cash out, they would come to us and we would give them cash. But then we found a financial district in Herat that people do money exchange exchange. They change Afghanis to dollars to euro and vice versa.

And then since kind of like in November last year, we were like, okay, it’s just too complicated and we’re done with all this like third-party and paperwork and everything is just like too much. And let’s see how we can work it out. And then we start investigating and then we found some people in the financial districts of Herat that they said, yes, we can exchange crypto for you.

And then we started at a small scale, just building trust through the relationship with them and see how it works. And it worked so great for us that now that one person is actually about three or four people. So now there are more people who do that. So what we do, we send crypto from our wallet to our team wallet in Afghanistan. And then they go to the exchange and they convert it to mainly US dollar. And then we distribute the cash among the team to pay for rent utility, and also again recently for the cash assistance for our students.

Laura Shin:

Oh, so they’re actually turning it into US dollars. And then I guess later on the, when they need the money, then they put it into Afghanis or something?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. Then they can go to any money exchange there and convert their dollar to Afghani if they want.

Laura Shin:

And for those individual sellers that you’re trading with, are they associated with any of that kind of you know Craigslist style sellers, like Local Bitcoins or Paxful? Or are they just kind of like independent people that offer this service?

Fereshteh Forough:

They’re independent people that they offer the services.

Laura Shin:

Oh, interesting. Other than Code to Inspire, how popular is crypto in Afghanistan or what other people are using it for?

Fereshteh Forough:

To be honest with you, I think since last winter, crypto got more momentum in Afghanistan and we did have a lot of people who reached out to me, either from colleagues or other non-profits who reached out, and they said, oh, like, we see that, like you do a lot of crypto, can you give us a little bit of like how it works? We’re interested to explore that because again, the financial difficulties we’re facing. And we connect some of them to this money exchange person that we know and trust.

Even recently, a couple of weeks ago, again, because of the humanitarian crisis that’s happening in Afghanistan with everything and the bank closed and the Western Union, more nonprofits are reaching out to me, humanitarian aid is reaching out to me and ask how we are handling it. And I’m kind of like putting them in touch with the people that we know. And hopefully that actually would be a way that it opens the door for cryptocurrency to be adopted more.

Laura Shin:

Huh. This is just so interesting. And so for the community around your school, like the girls and their families, and people just who know generally about Code to Inspire, what would you say that their perception is of cryptocurrency now, because of all this?

Fereshteh Forough:

So first of all, it was very unknown to them. They were like, what is this? I can’t touch it. It’s like over the internet. They were like, is it a scam? Do you want to scam us? People had a lot of different thoughts about this. I hear them because like they used to do this old system of only keeping cash under their pillows. That’s how they kind of like saved their money. So when you go and tell them it’s money over the internet, they’re confused. Especially when they don’t have basic digital literacy, then that would be more difficult to talk to them about this. But then once we started sending to our own team, as an example and how they used it for their own, we could pay for our rent.

And then we start sending the cash assistance to our students. And now the family’s getting it. Now, when people, at the end of the day, they see the cash, they understand what’s the work flow of it. But also like how it is important, the privacy aspect of it, how you can control your money. Because in geographical locations like Afghanistan, it’s always been under conflict, war. The political system changes a lot and each of them come and they have their own agenda. It is really difficult to trust in the centralized system, the banks and the governments, because you don’t know what kind of revelations they bring. And then for example, even right now, a lot of people who left Afghanistan, who got evacuation, majority of them left their bank account behind, and they don’t know if they can access that bank out anytime soon. God knows how much money they had in it, but they had a decent amount of number. to be able to carry your finance with yourself outside of the conflict zone. That’s a very big lesson that a lot of people are learning. And I think crypto will change that and help the people to realize that it’s important to be as much as independent, especially if you’re living in a conflict zone.

Laura Shin:

This is so interesting that you’re seeing all this because I feel like there’s, for the longest time in the crypto industry, there’s been an idealistic notion that crypto will help the unbanked. At least here in the US, it doesn’t seem to have happened to a great extent. So I’m glad to hear that people seem to be benefiting from that in Afghanistan.

I just want to get a sense: do you still feel that it’s not very widespread and it’s just kind of like a small number of people in the know, or do you feel like it’s kind of like something that people are hearing about quickly?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah. It’s not really widespread, but I guess like within the international community and people who are sending aid to Afghanistan, that’s something that they are investigating and are open to explore because they all of a sudden have faced a blockage of like sending aids to Afghanistan. And they also don’t want to send the money to the banks with this situation. So they’re exploring ways that firsthand send the money to the people who are in need. And that’s the only way. So that’s great to see that now the international community and the aids are looking at crypto as a way for how and secure to send funds instead of relying and sending money to the banks and to the governments.

Laura Shin:

All right. So in a moment, we’re going to talk a little bit more about the effect of the withdrawal from Afghanistan of US troops has had there, but first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

Back to my conversation with Fereshteh. So you’ve kind of been alluding to the impact that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has had there. But for now, for all that you described about Code to Inspire, what is the situation now? Is the school functioning, what has happened to the girls and their families, et cetera?

Fereshteh Forough:

Well, the situation on the ground is certainly very devastating. Not only because a humanitarian crisis is happening right now — banks are closed. There is no job economy. It’s falling apart. And you know, a lot of people are dealing with hunger and even they don’t have money to cover basics necessities. And that’s what we are also like dealing with our students and their families who about 80 of them reach out to me, and they said they have even not having a bread at home. And it’s very difficult because the majority of them lost jobs, and especially women. But despite the humanitarian crisis, of course, education, which is a fundamental human right. And everyone should have access to education, no matter of their gender identity or any differences. It’s getting a lot of backlashes in Afghanistan — since the fall of Afghanistan did, sorry.

Since Afghanistan fallen to the Taliban on August 15, I can say that that was the first day that Herat, my city, after two weeks of resistance, was captured by the Taliban. And for me watching the videos of Taliban walking through the city was very heartbreaking, tragic. I remember that day. And for the next couple of days, I cried a lot because I couldn’t believe that just things are on unfolding so quickly like that. And all the work that we’ve on and everyone else has done this past 20 years may be taken from us. And then unfortunately within one week, so quickly, the entire Afghanistan has got into all the influence of Taliban. And when people say Taliban 2.0, they changed, I don’t think they changed, because if they’ve been changed, the situation right now wouldn’t be devastating, right?

First of all, we closed the school because we didn’t want to. We closed the school before, even two weeks before, when the attacks happened around the city, because of the safety of our students. The school is still closed because we don’t know what going to happen if we open the school in person, even though we are a single gender school. The Taliban shouldn’t have an issue with that.

Regarding the education. The Taliban allow the girls to go to school only from first to sixth grade. And then four days ago, they announced the first day back to school and with their announcement, they only said the boys can go to school from first to 12th grade. So they let the boys from seventh grade to 12th grade and other private institutes, religious school go to school.

But not women. No girls from 7th to 12th grade are allowed to go to school still as of now. And also the universities, they had conversation with the board of universities, but they only had conversation with the male board and the professors and not women. And they kind of like make an excuse that they say, oh, we’re thinking about separation of the classes, but the high school of the girls in Afghanistan are already separated. You know, the schools are separated, the building is separated. So why they don’t let the girls go to school? Well, university, yes, there used to be mixed classes, but not the high school. And that’s why you can’t trust them because they’re not clear and they are, of course, preventing girls go to school.

And the same as the university and also work. We had like students who used to work in offices that they used to work and now they’re not going there because they’re not allowed to go. And they don’t know if they can return to the offices and work. So it is a strain that all these millions of girls who had hopes, who had dreams, and every day they go to school. Now they’re home and they don’t know what’s going to happen to them. And their future is not clear.

Laura Shin:

I saw you tweeted that girls there are texting you messages like I am afraid for my life, I haven’t eaten these past days, and slept in different houses overnights for my safety. And I wondered, so this was from a few weeks ago, and I wondered, has that changed at all? Is the comfort level a little bit higher now? Or are the girls still living in a state of fear?

Fereshteh Forough:

Not really. Definitely the girls are still living in a state of fear and trauma. I still received messages from girls that they’re like, I lost hope. I wanted to do this and that, but I don’t think… if there would be a possibility for me to have education outside of Afghanistan, will you help me? So I received a lot of emails and texts, not only from our students, but from people that I haven’t met and they asked for help. And it’s so heartbreaking to see that a functioning government. And I don’t all deny that there was corruption in the previous government. There were still people who were against women’s education, work, and employment. It wasn’t a perfect government, but at least it was functioning. My school was open, and I could help the girls to get an education and a lot of girls around Afghanistan could go to school. But with this government, it seems everything is closed only for women.

And they just like totally ignoring half of the community and the society. The girls are going through a lot of trauma. I mean, like we weren’t able even to continue any of our classes virtually because they just can’t concentrate. Some of them left the city with their family. They are in other cities. Some of them left the country. Some of them their house got shot by the Taliban or because of the explosion, the house got destructed. So just, I can’t imagine you’re dealing with all that, you still have the motivation to continue and will have hope for your future.

Laura Shin:

And so are you just kind of in an indefinite holding pattern with Code to Inspire? Or is there any sign that would kind of make you feel comfortable opening it again? And, also, when you talked about how you can’t do virtual classes, I didn’t know how widespread the internet would be in homes. I didn’t know, is this something where they could kind of take these classes in their own homes or do the coding work in their own homes?

Fereshteh Forough:

There’s two possibilities here, right? I mean, maybe I would be able to keep the school open under certain rules and circumstances. And, sure, why not? Because that space was the safest space for the girls and they had access to a lot of resources. And if that space can be open and of course they would be safe. Why not? I’ll keep the school open, and that will be great. But for whatever reason, if we wouldn’t be able to keep the school open, of course, virtual is what we’re going to pursue and do that. But within the next month or so we hopefully have a better understanding of what’s the agenda and how we can move forward. But absolutely I will continue my work ritual. I make sure the girl has a laptop and an internet connection at home. We put all the content we have online and we help them to continue to classes the same as before, but virtual, in a safe space at their home, and then help them to find jobs remotely, which right now we still have about like three clients that about eight of our students are still working and do their projects online, which kept them hopeful. And I think that’s one thing, then we will continue no matter what.

Laura Shin:

Yeah, I did see that back in 2018, Code to Inspire, did start a partnership with Bounties Network to allow girls to collect bounties in ETH for fixing vulnerabilities in code. Is that something you’re still doing. If not, like, are there other ways that the crypto community or that blockchain technology generally can help in this situation?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yeah, that was actually a very exciting project that we worked with. We had, some of our students get engaged to some small projects. It was great. Right now we are not that much involved, but it was certainly a great eye-opening experience where I was students to work in such platforms and then get to know about crypto.

And as of now, yes, I mean, we are trying to find people who want to help us with their skill and expertise, and if they can help us to create a very strong, private, secure, online platform, educational for our students, and then people who have experienced teaching coding and help us with different sets of programming languages, to create videos so we can share with our students or want to be a mentor and help our students with their codings. With the companies, definitely if they want to offer internships for our students, part-time, full-time projects and work. I mean, these are the opportunities that we would be able, by giving a laptop, and buying internet package for our students, helped them to get motivated and continue what they do from the safety of their house.

Laura Shin:

And there was also been a lot of talk and, and work, on things like decentralized identity solutions or decentralized mesh networks for offering internet. Is that something that would be helpful in this situation at all?

Fereshteh Forough:

To be honest with you, I don’t know what would be the Taliban agenda regarding the internet censorship. I don’t know if they are going to censor or are they going to track people or what would be their agenda on that. Because, for example, before their attack to Herat city, they actually bombed an internet tower and an electricity tower. And that actually was a huge damage to the entire Western region. The whole city in the Western region were all offline for a couple of weeks. Of course, with the work we do and if it should be virtual, then that would be a big issue. So I think it’s just like, again, depends on like how they interact with the infrastructure, if they’re going to bring any damage, any censorship, tracking people. And these are like the factors and variables that we really want to take into consideration and make it as private, encrypted, and safe for the girls even to have an online identity.

Laura Shin:

Okay. But so far it sounds like the financial part of crypto is what has been most useful for your school.

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes.

Laura Shin:

In that regard, one question I had is, I’m assuming and correct me if I’m wrong, that perhaps the cryptocurrencies that most people donate are bitcoin and ether and they’re also the most liquid. But at the moment, or really for kind of a while now, they’ve both been experiencing somewhat high fees on the base layer chain. Does that affect you at all? Like I noticed today, the date we’re recording, the average transaction fee on bitcoin is about $2.50 cents. And for ether today, it’s like a little under $4, but a few days ago is highest $7. So I didn’t know if that has affected you at all, or if it’s not something that if it’s something that the sellers don’t really count.

Fereshteh Forough:

We really haven’t faced issues with that. And again, with the person who exchange crypto for us, they don’t charge us like a crazy amount. We want to make them happy and keep them happy to do business with us. So we pay a very small fee to them. But so far now we haven’t been much influenced by that. And again, the fact that we are using this technology, in this situation, it was like the best tool that’s just enabled us and helped us. So we are very happy with the way that we are managing our finance and sending money to Afghanistan.

Laura Shin:

So from your perspective as somebody who does use crypto a lot in a very crucial way, are there any kind of like requests you would make to developers in the industry for tools? Or for certain types of technology that you feel would be useful? Or just anything you feel that entrepreneurs in the space could think about?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. I still think that, as you said, when we talk about crypto and we say the notion of it was to help the unbanked and under served communities, I think is still probably a lot of the solutions that come out. It’s for more privileged people who do have access to banks, who do have credit cards, or some sort of financial freedom and living in a more relaxed community. So any solutions, especially for people who live in constant conflict and war and displacement — either to keep their identity private, to keep their documents private, and that can carry with themselves any part of the world. I think that’s something that’s very important. How you can keep your documents somewhere very private that you can access, but also like you can use it because down the road, when you’re a refugee, you leave everything behind. Even carrying certain documents would be very dangerous for you because then they can identify who you are. And that would be a big issue. So that’s something if there are solutions around, would be helpful.

And also in case of finance. Solutions, if exchanges or any apps or any solution, that can help people not only rely on the local exchange, but like create a more faster and easier way for them to access the crypto market, will also would be able to cash it out. I mean, right now, if you want to create accounts on different exchanges to KYC, which is understandable, but it would be very difficult for a lot of people in Afghanistan, just because a lot of them don’t have proper documents on identification. And that’s one step that won’t let them to even create an account, let alone to use that exchange in everything.

Laura Shin:

Yeah. Well, that’s what I was talking about when I was mentioning blockchain based identities. I don’t know of any that are kind of in widespread use. Is that something that you’ve looked into at all?

Fereshteh Forough:

No, to be honest with you, I don’t have any knowledge around it.

Laura Shin:

I don’t feel like I’ve heard kind of a lot of concrete work in that area. That is something that I think could address these issues that you’re discussing. So as we’ve been discussing throughout this interview, there’s clearly a lot of sexism and discrimination that you have faced in Afghanistan as a woman. But this is an issue in a lot of parts in the world and here in the US, and just in general, you could say in the western world, like Europe and the US, there aren’t as many women in crypto or involved in blockchain technology as there are men. And I just wondered from your experience as a woman in tech, in Afghanistan, do you have any advice for bringing more women into crypto? Or advice to women in the field who feel that they’re facing sexism and discrimination?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. It’s an interesting question because I can say I have a thick skin now and don’t get bothered. I went through a lot. Generally speaking, I’m a risk-taker person. I’m not really bothered by all these issues.

But what I think from being different, just a refugee hiding my true identity in Iran as a refugee and then a woman in technology and Afghanistan being very outspoken, social, which cost me a lot. I think being indifferent, even as like a woman in a group that they’re all men, it’s beautiful because you bring a different perspective to everyone else’s perspective who is similar. So you have actually way stronger voice than the rest of the group.

You think you are outnumbered, but actually, your voice is stronger because it’s your opinion and the value you bring to the table is much more different and might be things that they’ve never imagined. So I think even if you walk in a room — it doesn’t matter if it’s like a tech meeting, crypto space, any space, that you walk in and you are one of the very few women, or the only woman, you should be so proud that you are in that group, because those people actually give an opportunity to see a different perspective. So for me, I think you have to just go for it. And those single number of women in those meetings are actually opening the doors for other women to walk in. So it is an opportunity for us to take it and change the environment. And of course it’s not an easy path. I’m sure a lot of women face a lot of sexism, terrible sexual harassment, and any other backlashes. But I think it’s that I can be the one who can open the door for the rest. Then sure, I’ll take it. And I’ll like lead that path.

Laura Shin:

Earlier in the episode, you said that you had a lot of inspiring stories like that one that you told about the girl. And I wondered if you wanted to share one more.

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. We had one other student that she was working with a client here and working on the graphic design. And she was also coming from a challenging financial background, but she was a brilliant student, very great graphic designer. I really liked her work and we picked her for doing the work for them. And she worked so well that the client were like, oh my God, you are so happy with her. And they used to pay her like $10 per hour. And then they said, now you’re going to pay you $30 per hour. And with that money, she used to use the laptop that we were given her to do the work because she didn’t have a laptop. She not only makes a lot of good money that she bought a laptop for herself, but also like paid for the education for the brothers and also helped the family. And that was like when she had texted to me and she said, I couldn’t believe the day when I walk into this school, I could make this money and I can buy a laptop for myself and now do the work and help my family. It’s just like unreal. And like, that was the whole world to me to see that like her life changed like that.

Laura Shin:

That’s so great. I love it. So for listeners who were interested in helping Code to Inspire what can they do? Where can they go?

Fereshteh Forough:

Well, we are a non-profit registered. So we are a tax-deductible organization, both for you know, fiat currency and cryptocurrency. So if they’re interested to support us, sponsor students, especially with the cash assistance that we’re dealing with now or purchasing equipment, they can check out website codetoinspire.org and they can donate to our cause. Besides that, we are looking for people who are interested in what we do right now and care about the future of African girls and their education. We would like to have their expertise, as I said, in the case of building a virtual system. If they’ve been teaching, coding, used their materials and curriculum. If they are looking to hire our graduates and students, we are happy to have a conversation. So many possibilities, any opportunities that they think, would certainly change lives and would be really appreciated. So we are very open to have conversations with them.

Laura Shin:

Great. And where can people learn more about you, such as like a Twitter handle?

Fereshteh Forough:

Yes. my Twitter account is @f_forough. That’s my Twitter handle.

Laura Shin:

Well, thank you so much for coming on Unchained.

Fereshteh Forough:

Absolutely. Thanks for having me. I appreciate that you gave your platform in such a difficult time for Afghanistan to shed some light and just raise more awareness in this about what’s the current situation in the future for women above mechanist.

Laura Shin:

Yeah. And I really wish you and all your students, the best of luck navigating this time. And I really hope everything works out the best for all of you.

Laura Shin:

Thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about Fereshteh and Code to Inspire, check out the show notes for this episode. Unchained is produced by me, Laura Shin, without from Anthony Yoon, Daniel Nuss and Mark Murdock. Thanks for listening."

2021-10-07 17:33:47+00:00	Africa Is A Hotbed For Crypto Adoption And It Is Not Slowing Down	['Muyela Roberto']	"Africa currently boasts the highest rates of crypto adoption in the world. Its crypto markets which are mostly restricted to P2P trading, have recorded tremendous growth in the past year.

The entrance of fintech offering a variety of crypto solutions to the populace has brought African investors to the forefront of crypto adoption. From unemployment to struggling economies, a number of factors drive the crypto adoption rate in the continent.

Data shows that between 2020 and 2021, the adoption rate grew 1,200%, translating to an additional $105.6 billion in crypto traded in the continent in the space of a year. Just like the rest of the world, the pandemic that sent countries into lockdown had rocked the continent to its core. Inflation, unemployment, and poverty rates shot up. Leaving citizens in tight, desperate situations, to which crypto provided a solution.

The high rate of adoption on the continent has not gone unnoticed by prominent players in the crypto space. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is quoted saying that “Africa will define the future” of cryptocurrencies.

And “The State of Crypto-Africa,” a research report on Africa’s burgeoning crypto market, stated present economic and demographic trends made Africa “one of, if not the most promising region, for the adoption of cryptocurrencies.”

Hedging Against The Economy

African countries have experienced some of the highest inflation rates in the world. Sudan had seen almost 200% inflation rates, while the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria, recorded inflation rates of up to 17%.

With rising inflation rates, currency values have gone down, and dragged down the buying power of the populace along with it. This is why citizens have had to look for ways to hedge against the rising inflation rates in their countries.

The reduced buying power shines through in the percentage of global crypto value owned by Africans. A Chainalysis report shows that African investors account for only about 2% of global crypto value, despite having the highest rate of adoption in the globe. This number is insignificant given the fact that Africa currently makes up 15% of the global population.

Investors in the continent are however not deterred by their reduced buying power. If anything, the devaluing of various African currencies have shown just how important it is for residents to find alternative vehicles to save and invest their money.

Earning A Living With Crypto

One interesting factor that has led to the high adoption rate in Africa has to do with its high unemployment rate. It is estimated that about 42% of youths in Nigeria, who make up about 50% of the labor force, are unemployed.

This has sparked the unemployed to turn to crypto as a way to earn a living. Given that this population is made up of young people who are more inclined to adopt new technologies, they have taken to the crypto market like fish to water.

Decentralized finance options like staking has gained footing in the country, presenting a way for the residents to earn passive income on their cryptocurrency. The Africa fintech space is booming as startups race to provide an eager population with crypto products. And with the rise of the startups have come novel technologies to the African market, which the population have embraced with open arms.

Sergey Ordin, marketing director of Roy Club, an international crypto community, noted the ease with which Africans take to new technologies. Sergey pointed out that Africans were more likely to explore new financial opportunities where others would be more conservative, and the young people are driving the adoption in their pursuit of financial independence.

Commenting on this, Sergey explained that Africans “have no problem with mastering new technologies.” The Roy Club revealed that interest in its free educational products like Roy School and Roy Academy are very high, and citizens are eager to learn about the crypto market.

Remittances And New Opportunities

Crypto had begun to gain footing on the continent when remittance fees had increased. Africa currently has the highest remittance fees in the world, with commissions as high as 8.9%, compared to the global average of 6.8%.

This is where the search for alternative methods of remitting funds had begun and crypto had provided the perfect solution for this problem.

Users could send funds directly to their loved ones back home and would only need to pay network transfer fees on the blockchain, which were considerably lower than the commissions taken by traditional payment processors. And as the remittance market boomed, crypto trading had grown with it.

Passive Income With Roy Club

Earning passive income with staking in Africa has become quite popular, especially amongst its youth population. Popular staking pools like UMI offered by the Roy Club are currently operating in Africa as citizens take advantage of this new way to earn.

Staking in the UMI pool provides users with returns of 5% on staking pools with 50,000 UMI and up to 40% for pools with 1,000,000,000 UMI. Users often pool their resources in these staking pools in order to increase their ROIs (return on investment).

Earning money through crypto for day to day living remains one of the biggest drivers of crypto adoption in Africa. Buchi Okoro, CEO of Quidax, notes that a high percentage of its users are utilizing the platform as a way to “earn a living.”
