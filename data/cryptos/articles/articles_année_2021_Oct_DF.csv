Speaking on the performance of Bitcoin, Siddharth Menon, COO WazirX, said, “Bitcoin continues to remain bearish. However, an interesting point to note is that the RSI indicator has shown a breakout from the current pattern which is an affirmation of a definite buying momentum. The coming weeks may see a pullback from the current value. The dollar index is consolidating at the current levels and may show some weakness in the days to come.”

“With Bitcoin digital currency up 51 per cent this year, and the market capitalization risen above $800 billion, the crypto market is on track towards its projected reach of $4.94 billion by 2030,” said the CoinDCX Research Team

Numerous market dips and crashes have seen the digital asset crashing back down below $3,000 in recent weeks and this has left ETH in a struggling position. With momentum down, it looks like the market is headed for another bear market as cryptocurrencies are now recording lower lows and lower highs with each dip and recovery.

The asset had dropped below the $2,700 price range for the first time in a two-month period. And the September slowdown has caused recovery trends to fall short of expectations. Despite this, crypto analyst Lark Davis does not believe the asset should be counted out just here. Pointing to some interesting exchange reserve metrics, the analyst believes that Ethereum could very well be on the verge of an explosion.

Exchange Reserves Drop 15%

Declining exchange reserves volume has been reported upon recently. This is not peculiar to Ethereum alone. Data shows that in addition to ETH, Bitcoin exchange reserves have also plummeted in the past couple of months. This goes against the grain of how bull markets have operated in the past. With each past rally have come increased exchange reserves as investors moved their assets onto centralized exchanges to sell and take profits. But 2021 has been the year of the unexpected in the crypto market.

Instead of exchange reserves going up as the price went up, it has gone the opposite direction. At the height of the bull rally this year, there had been 21 million ETH on centralized exchanges. But even as the market has dipped and recovered at various points, exchange balances are going down. Now, there is about 18 million ETH on centralized exchanges, showing a 15% decline from the height of the bull market earlier in the year.

Crypto analyst Lark Davis said of the decreased exchange balances, “There are around 3 million less Ethereum on exchanges now compared to when the price was at an all-time high. This market is a ticking time bomb.”

Why Exchange Reserves Are On The Decline

One reason for exchange reserves being on the decline is due to accumulation patterns by investors. Market sentiment has skewed more towards holding than selling despite the recent bull rally and as such, investors are buying more cryptocurrencies and moving these assets to more secure personal wallets. These accumulation patterns are driving what may be a supply shock across the top 2 cryptocurrencies in the market.

Another reason for declining Ethereum exchange reserves has been attributed to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). This is because most DeFi activities are carried out on the Ethereum blockchain and as such, ETH tokens are required to carry out transactions. Therefore, investors are moving their ETH from centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges, leading to decreased centralized exchange reserves.

He Began Writing About Blockchain Technology In He Has Managed Numerous Crypto-Related Projects', 'Is Passionate About All Things Blockchain.']	"The price of bitcoin has jumped to a weekly high of nearly $45,000 amid positive news coming from the US Fed Chair – Jerome Powell. Most alternative coins have also marked substantial daily gains, with ETH rising above $3,100 and BNB jumping to $400.

Bitcoin Eyes $45K

The tides seemed to have turned in the cryptocurrency space in the past 24 hours. On Wednesday, bitcoin had dumped below $41,000 for the third time since the start of the week, and the situation looked grim at best.

However, the bulls managed to intercept this drop just like the previous ones and pushed the asset north. As reported yesterday, this resulted in BTC exceeding $43,000.

The cryptocurrency even attempted to break above $44,000 but was initially stopped. However, BTC shot up in the hours after and neared $45,000. This came shortly after the US Federal Reserve Chairman – Jerome Powell – said during a two-hour House Finance Services Committee meeting that the country has no intentions to ban cryptocurrencies.

As a result, bitcoin spiked to its current level, which is the highest it has been in a week. Consequently, its market capitalization has increased to $850 billion.

Most larger-cap alternative coins remained stagnant in the past few days. This is not the case now, though. Ethereum had fallen to $2,900 and struggled to reclaim $3,000. However, a 5% daily increase has driven the second-largest cryptocurrency to above $3,100 as of now.

Cardano also dipped hard during the week but currently stands at $2.15 after a 4.5% jump. Binance Coin, which was the best performer yesterday, continues to impress again with an 8.5% increase to over $400.

Ripple (4.5%), Solana (6%), Polkadot (7.5%), Dogecoin (3%), Terra (11%), Avalanche (1.5%), Uniswap (9.5%), and Chainlink (6%) are also well in the green.

Further gains are evident from OMG Network (23%), VeChain (21%), Qtum (19%), Tezos (15%), IOTA (11%), THORChain (11%), AMP (11%), Arweave (11%), and ICON (10%).

The cryptocurrency market cap has increased by roughly $100 billion and is just shy of $2 trillion."

Redman Has Been An Active Member Of The Cryptocurrency Community Since He Has A Passion For Bitcoin', 'Open-Source Code', 'Decentralized Applications. Since September', 'Redman Has Written More Than Articles For Bitcoin.Com News About The Disruptive Protocols Emerging Today.']	"Top Ten Crypto Market Capitalizations Shifted a Great Deal Since the Last Time BTC Hit $60K

The price of bitcoin recently jumped above the $60,000 per unit mark on October 15, and the leading crypto asset has not seen prices this high since mid-April six months ago. However, as far as the top digital assets are concerned, in terms of market capitalization, things are a whole lot different. For instance, ether tokens are worth a lot more than they were six months ago and binance coin values were higher back then than they are today.

Six Months Later as Bitcoin Returns to $60K, Some Crypto Coins Trade for More Value, While Others Trade for Less

On April 11, 2021, statistics from coinmarketcap.com’s historical snapshot data show that on that day, bitcoin (BTC) exchanged hands for $60,204 per unit. BTC also reached an all-time high three days later on Apr 14, 2021, at $64,804 per coin that week. The data from the historical snapshot indicates that ethereum (ETH) was swapping for $2,157 per coin on April 11 and today, a single ether is trading for $3,761 per unit.

The stats six months ago show binance coin (BNB) held the third position six months ago and at the time each BNB traded for $525. Prices are a bit lower than they were back then and BNB lost the third position to cardano (ADA) for a few months. Today, metrics show that BNB is swapping for $480 per coin which is 9.375% lower than the price six months ago. At that time, XRP held the fourth position in terms of market cap but today, XRP has slid to the sixth position.

The stablecoin tether (USDT) held the fifth spot back then, today it is sitting at number four. Like ethereum (ETH), cardano (ADA) is another coin that was trading for lower prices on April 11. At the time, ADA exchanged hands for $1.27 per coin and on October 18, ADA trades for $2.12 per unit. Polkadot (DOT) held the seventh position trading for $41.42 per DOT six months ago, today DOT trades for a touch lower at $40.76 and sits in the eighth largest position.

Litecoin, Uniswap, Chainlink Bumped Out of the Top 10 — Theta, Filecoin, Tron, Vechain Slip Out of the Top 20

Litecoin (LTC), uniswap (UNI), and chainlink (LINK) held the last three positions in the top ten respectively. But none of these coins are in the top ten positions anymore and UNI is the closest today. Positioned at 14 today, UNI is trading for $25.39 but on April 11, the token changed hands for $29.98. LTC was holding the eighth largest market valuation six months ago, but today it has slid to the 16th largest. LTC exchanged hands for $253.63 and today its much lower at $185.22.

Chainlink (LINK) was swapping hands for $33.92 per LINK back then, but on October 18, the price is around $25.59. LINK at that time held the tenth-largest spot and it now holds the 18th position. Missing from the top 20 coins that were seen on the list back then include tokens like theta (THETA) filecoin (FIL), tron (TRON) and vechain (VET). One notable gainer is solana (SOL) which moved from the 20th top position to the crypto economy’s seventh-largest spot in terms of valuation.

What do you think about the top ten crypto coin shift and some of the crypto assets that were bumped out of the top ten and twenty market positions during the last six months?

Russian president Vladimir Putin has expressed support for payments in cryptocurrency

Bitcoin and Crypto Market Watch

The global cryptocurrency market continued to grow this week to levels previously seen in May 2021 with the market cap crossing $2.4 trillion. Bitcoin rallied by 8% in the last 7 days to within touching distance of $60,000 today. It is currently trading near $59,400 as of 5 pm IST today. Bitcoin’s dominance of the market has steadily climbed to 46% over the past few weeks as reports of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granting approval to the Bitcoin Futures ETF this month continues to lift market sentiment.

In this article, we will track other stories that drove adoption in the crypto market this week.

Governments explore digital currencies

G7 finance leaders recently have set out 13 guiding principles for retail central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to support policy and design deliberations within and beyond the group. G7 is an inter-governmental political forum comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In this context, blockchain companies Ripple (ticker XRP) and Avalanche (ticker AVAX) have joined an independent group to support the development of a digital UK pound.

Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, has expressed support for cryptocurrencies as a means of payment although he remained skeptical of its use for oil contracts. Russia ruled out a blanket ban on crypto trading similar to China.

Investment firms see potential in crypto-based companies

Moonpay, a crypto fintech startup that allows the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies and digital assets using debit, credit cards and local bank transfers, has reportedly raised $400 million in its first round of funding led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management.

Crypto lending firm Celsius network has raised $400 million in a new equity funding round led by Canada’s second largest-pension fund CDPQ and WestCap, an equity firm.

More synergies between crypto and fiat emerge

Bakkt, a US cryptocurrency marketplace, has partnered with Google to allow its debit card users to purchase goods and services using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through the Google Pay wallet.

Strike, a payments company responsible for the Bitcoin tipping feature on Twitter, has released a new product feature called “Pay me in Bitcoin” which allows anyone to convert a portion of their income into Bitcoin with no fees.

With Bitcoin heading towards its all-time high in the near future, more institutional capital and strong retail participation is expected in the upcoming months.

2021-09-29 19:25:30+00:00	Regulating the unregulated cryptocurrency market	['Christina Pazzanese', 'Harvard Staff Writer']	"Is cryptocurrency the future of global banking and trade, or a sketchy payment and investment vehicle favored by scammers and speculators, criminal organizations, and any individual or entity shut out of Western banking systems, like North Korea?

The jury is still out. One thing that is clear, however, is that the cryptocurrency market continues to grow as its popularity has become more mainstream since 2019. Even many once-skeptical institutional investors have come around after seeing some of the mind-boggling returns. In January 2019, one Bitcoin traded for $3,441; this week, it hit $43,136.

But that success may have a price. Calls to rein in the industry are at fever pitch. This month China, one of the world’s largest digital currency markets, outlawed all crypto-related transactions. It banned trading them in 2019. The U.S. Treasury said this week it will sanction a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time for facilitating ransomware payments. New tax and trading rules for the industry are included in legislation Congress is scheduled to vote on by week’s end. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also pushing for greater enforcement. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler called cryptocurrency an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse” and said investors don’t have enough regulatory protection from the swarms jumping into crypto finance, issuance, trading, and lending.

Q&A

Scott Duke Kominers

GAZETTE: There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, but no consensus on the precise number. The range is between 5,000 and 12,000, valued at about $2 trillion. What does the landscape look like today?

KOMINERS: Those numbers sound huge, but there are actually many, many more than that because lots of crypto products are not currencies and lots of cryptocurrencies are too small to be part of mainstream exchanges. Many crypto products are effectively just tokens. Sometimes these are representative of ownership in decentralized autonomous organizations, which are organizations that share governance rights and returns to a committee of participants by allocating them tokens — a bit like stock shares. There are project-specific tokens used in specific online games or among individual communities. There are NFTs, which are unique non-fungible tokens that have been used as representing ownership over things like digital artworks. Tons of these are being minted daily at this point. So, there is a very large landscape. The pure currency aspect of it is a huge market on its own, but a drop in the bucket of the total applications of crypto and blockchain technology today.

GAZETTE: What’s the appeal for investors? Is it just the eye-popping returns or is there more to it?

KOMINERS: Some people have gotten interested in cryptocurrency because of the investment returns, unquestionably. But there are also real, practical infrastructure and technology benefits. You’re starting to see countries willing to receive officially recognized crypto payments. And people have been considering whether crypto technology can be used to deliver government aid. This is because when it’s working, crypto is frictionless, and thus creates a much more efficient way of transferring and sharing value among people. And, as a result, there’s a real opportunity to use crypto for large-scale payments, as well as in things like small business payment processing. Also, there’s a big opportunity for enhancing financial inclusion, by providing secure payment networks and cross-border transfers in places that don’t otherwise have well-structured consumer financial systems. So, while some people are interested in this for the short- or medium-term investment opportunity, I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.

GAZETTE: The SEC chairman called this an asset class “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse.” Is this industry operating in a rule-free, “Wild West” atmosphere, as he suggested?

KOMINERS: I haven’t read the full Gensler remarks, so I can’t comment explicitly on his overall take, but I can comment on some of the individual elements you mention. It’s clear that this space needs much more consumer protection, and we’re starting to see that. Right now, if a hacker gains access to your crypto wallet, they can drain it and you may have no recourse. But the newer waves of wallet technologies and crypto exchanges are thinking hard about all the things consumers expect out of banking products and equities trading accounts. They’re trying to create more security and protections at the consumer-interface level. And then, of course, you also need regulation to prevent financial crime and scams, just like we have in other parts of the financial-services industry.

GAZETTE: Some lawmakers have pointed to the GameStop stock trading frenzy in early 2021 as analogous to the crypto market, saying that most ordinary investors have gotten caught up in hype and don’t fully understand the risks they’re taking.

“I think a lot of the investment we’ve seen flow in on the institutional and venture sides is because there are real, valuable technologies that are being built on crypto backbones that can do things we never could do before in markets.”

KOMINERS: First of all, it’s important to note that the GameStop run-up wasn’t in a new trading arena — it was Internet-hyped trading of a specific stock in the regular stock market. That said, the GameStop story is in some sense analogous to the meme trading of crypto products like Dogecoin — there’s consumer confusion around the idea that these assets could lose value. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the GameStop and Dogecoin run-ups and crashes. They were on a platform that made trading feel like a video game, and didn’t understand the real risks. And so in those ways, it’s analogous. Consumers and investors need to understand that these are high variance, speculative assets.

But when you get to the technology infrastructure pieces, GameStop and crypto can look very different. Cryptocurrency trading now looks a lot like equities trading — you have a brokerage account at an exchange, or potentially on a platform like Robinhood. But for many of the other crypto applications, the infrastructure is very, very new, and the platforms are very, very new, and they’re not heavily protected.

I think we’ll see more regulation around messaging and communication, but there are also more structural questions. For example, one of the regulatory conversations is around stablecoins — crypto assets that hold nominally fixed values because they’re designed to just be used for moving money from one place to another in a fixed denomination. They’re typically backed by reserves in a way similar to how banks back their loans with deposits. But there are questions about how to properly structure those reserves. If everyone simultaneously decided they wanted to divest, will stablecoins have the reserves to support that? I expect to see regulation around allowable assets and reserve design — just like we have with banks.

And finally, we’ll need regulation to ensure open competition among different crypto products and platforms.

GAZETTE: Besides fending off regulations, what are the industry’s other challenges?

KOMINERS: One basic challenge is around taxation of crypto income. This isn’t just about tax avoidance concerns — a lot of people would like to pay taxes on their crypto but have absolutely no idea how to do so. We don’t have clear crypto categories for taxation purposes, so it’s extremely complicated to figure out which parts are ordinary income versus capital gains, as well as when the associated income has accrued. Organizing the tax treatment of all these assets — and then, of course, ensuring tax payment — is essential.

Another challenge is environmental: A lot of the most popular crypto technologies at the moment require tremendous amounts of energy to run. And so, we’re going to start seeing government leadership and regulation driving a shift toward versions of this technology that are more environmentally sustainable.

Bitcoin and other early blockchains use a technology where you have to prove that you solved a very hard computational problem to record transactions securely. And solving those computational problems is taking up absurd amounts of energy. Newer blockchains use much less energy-intensive ways of validating transactions. And so, my guess and hope is that the way we’re going to get away from environmentally harmful cryptocurrency transactions is through continual improvements in the technology, alongside regulation and market forces pushing toward technologies that are much more efficient.

GAZETTE: If new regulations are on the way, what would be the best- or worst-case scenarios for the industry?

KOMINERS: I don’t think it’s a question of ‘no regulation’ versus ‘a lot.’ The real question is the extent to which regulators understand that crypto is a different type of product and tech infrastructure from anything they’ve regulated before. The worst case would be to just treat it like historical financial products or like historical tech platforms without thinking about the ways in which crypto differs, both in terms of its use cases and in terms of its underlying technology."
2021-10-22 02:13:53+00:00	Bitcoin falls from record high, ether, other cryptos also plunge. Check cryptocurrency prices today	[]	"Cryptocurrency prices plunged today as Bitcoin declined from its all-time high it had hit two days ago after the debut of the first US bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund. The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading 4% lower at $62,740.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, was down over 2% to $4,112, as per CoinDesk. Cardano prices fell nearly 3% to $2.16 whereas dogecoin also slipped 3% to $0.24. Other digital tokens like Shiba Inu, Binance Coin, Litecoin, Uniswap, XRP were also trading with cuts over the last 24 hours, though, Solana was up over 10%.

Bitcoin on Wednesday rallied to a record high of $66,974, the recent rally came after six-months from its previous top of $64,895, fueled by the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Investors have bet the long-awaited launch of bitcoin ETFs will lead to greater investment from both retail and institutional investors.

Yet analysts at JPMorgan voiced doubt over how long-lasting the boost to bitcoin's price from the ProShares ETF, which trades under the ticker BITO, would be. ""Will the launch of BITO by itself bring significantly more fresh capital into bitcoin? We doubt it given the multitude of investment choices bitcoin investors already have,"" they wrote in a note, as reported by Reuters.

The ETF doesn’t invest directly in Bitcoin. It instead invests in the futures market tied to Bitcoin. Someone with an old-school brokerage account can buy the ETF, for example, without having to open a trading account for crypto.
