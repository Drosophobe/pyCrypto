Bitcoin (BTC) price changes are volatile due to many reasons, such as its specially different perceived values by public and high profile losses. In this article, we focus on one of its major factor, BTC news articles’ influences. Due to the past momentum of BTC and a huge portion of BTC market among the cryptocurrency market, a massive group of BTC players have already existed. However, an analytically quantitative methodology to make decisions in this market is still lacking, so we endeavored to help with this situation based on machine learning algorithms here.

Utilizing various vanilla supervised machine learning algorithms and exploring semi-supervised algorithms, we built a model to predict whether a certain news article will cause an apparent BTC price increase or decrease to help BTC players to make a more reasonable decision on selling or buying BTC.

Our project is roughly split into three major parts, financial data processing, news articles processing, and final prediction models. Can’t wait to go through the whole process now!

Financial Data processing

We scraped BTC second-by-second datasets from 01/01/2018 to 04/o1/2018 on Kaggle, which consists of the following information after being converted to a day-based dataset.

According to the stock market’s rule of thumb, an obvious change of stock price is defined as price fluctuation more than 2 standard deviations of past 30 days’ rolling average price, but there is no generally acknowledged definition of distinct BTC price change. And due to the dramatically and constantly changing BTC price, it is hard to test which number of standard deviations the most distinct one. Therefore, we use the same 2 standard deviations as in the stock market for BTC. The code is as the follows,

Basic math equation of calculating 2 standard deviations

Based on the metric, we got and marked the dates with obvious BTC price change in our selected period. Then we divided the dates into three groups, first group with distinct price increases, which has namely positive markers (Date: 3/19/2018), and second with distinct price decreases and positive markers (Dates: 2/5/2019, 3/15/2019, 3/17/2019, 3/18/2019), and another trivial one with price changes within 2 standard deviations.

Now we move on to the second part, news articles’ data processing. The logic of these two parts’ connection will be elaborated at the third part.

News articles

We used news API (the following keys are available to use) to extract news articles within the same specified date range as in the first part.

Available News API keys

The contents extracted from news articles are shown in the following form,

News articles’ extracted contents

As the lead of news articles always contains the most important information, and there are many readers who only skim the introductory paragraph, so for the content column, we only extracted the lead of news articles.

We regard the top 100 most frequently appearing words (the lemmatization and stemming are done and stop words are deleted at first) in all the extracted article’s introductory paragraphs as our corpora, and we deem them most relevant to BTC trading and price, so if a news article does not mention any of these keywords in the first 300 words, we deem this article irrelevant to BTC and then exclude it from our to-be-explored articles. (The first 300 words is the main idea of a news article concluded by empirical analysis and we do not choose introductory paragraph is because sometimes the lead is fewer than 300 words and we want to cover more articles),

The following is part of the 100 words.

Words of top occurrences in news articles

Matched with the above three date groups, the news articles are also separated into three groups. Among the three, the two groups with distinct price changes are our focus.

Then we processed our features, until now, we have got the author and publisher of each article. To convert the textual data into numeric one, first, we ranked authors and publishers according to the number of articles they released among our selected articles, and then by seeing the distribution of the number of articles, we divided the authors and publishers into five groups numbered 1 to 5 to make each group roughly have the same population.

The reason why we did not simply categorize the authors and publishers is that only tree-based algorithms like Random Forest can recognize categoric numbers, while non-tree based algorithms such as SVM will take the categoric number as some meaningful numeric numbers, which will highly influence the model’s accuracy.

Sentiment Analysis

There is a pretty important property of news article, the prevailing emotions expressed in them. Plenty of organizations have worked on the sentiment analysis of news articles, such as Microsoft’s Azure, Google’s Cloud Natural Language API and python’s NLTK package as well.

We have explored Google’s API and Azure, it turned out that Google’s works the better in our model after both were compared with our own judgments of the emotions in articles. In many pieces of researches, Google’s API also has the highest accuracy among all the tools.

To use Google API or Azure, you have to get authentication, the detailed setup process to conduct sentiment analysis in Python can be referred to https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data

The results that Google API gave have 4 columns, we only use two of them, one is score, the other one is magnitude. Score corresponds to the overall negative, neutral or positive emotions, ranging from -1 to 1. -1 means completely negative mood, while 1 is a positive extreme, and 0 means neutral emotion. The other extents of overall emotions vary between -1 and 1. Score has been normalized, which means that the number of news article’s words will not influence this number. Magnitude measures the overall strength of both positive and negative emotions. Unlike score, magnitude is not normalized, so it is proportional to article’s length and it ranges from 0 to +inf. For example, if an author in an article expressed both strong positive and negative emotions which canceled off positive one, the overall emotion delivered in that article will be neutral. However, magnitude counts all the cumulative emotions, so the final number of score might be 0, but magnitude is more than 3 or whatever big number.

The following are some examples given by Google,

Examples of sentiment judgment

(Exhaustive documentation can be found in

https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/basics#interpreting_sentiment_analysis_values)

To avoid the problem that the number of words in news article will influence the number of magnitude, we also normalized it.

TF-IDF Exploration

In a group of news article, some important words may appear many times in a certain news article while with few occurrences in the other news articles. The repeated presences will intensify the visual effects while readers are reading through an article, and thus readers are more likely to respond to these articles. TF-IDF score just helps us measure the influences well. TF-IDF which stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Data Frequency is the product of two parts.

The first part is Term Frequency, it calculates the frequency of every word in a document (in our study it is a news article) in a corpus with an equation,

n_i,j means the number of times a word i appears in a document j, the denominator is the total number of words in document j.

The second part is Inverse Data Frequency, its use is to calculate the weight of rare words across all our documents (all the news articles) as the follows,

N is the total number of documents, df_t is the number of documents which contain word t. Therefore, the words that rarely appear in all the documents but only in a small number of them will a high IDF score due to a low value of df_t.

Finally, we got TF-IDF score by multiplying the above two parts.

so if word i appears many times in a news article but seldom in other news article leading to a high TF-IDF score, we can conclude that this word is significant in this article. After deleting stop words, We deem words with high TF-IDF score as important words in the news, so we averaged the 5 highest IF-IDF score to measure the visual effects. The calculated result is basically shown like,

TF-IDF calculation result

Cheers! With all the food washed and condiments mixed, the only left task is to pour into the pot and boil. Let’s check out the prediction models now!

Prediction

Supervised Algorithms

We have totally 5 features in our model, which are publisher, author, sentiment score, sentiment magnitude score and TD-IDF score, the data is like

Prediction model’s five features

The predicted data are binary numbers. If the predicted value is 0, the news article is supposed to be not influential in the BTC market and will not cause distinct price change. Otherwise, this news article will give rise to obvious price change. And the results instantly released on our BTC app can be referred by BTC investors to decide whether to buy or sell, the prompt reactions of investors can help them save or earn a reasonable amount of money.

How precise the prediction is is tested by two metrics. First, we used the traditional metric, accuracy, to test it. Besides, we also drew ROC curve of those algorithms which have built-in probability calculation function and displayed AUC score of each ROC curve. The reason why we also explored ROC-AUC metric is that we desired to pay more attention to the positive result, 1. If the BTC players see 1 in most of that day’s news articles, they will gain the information that the BTC price will be highly probable to increase, and thus buy more BTC to speculate in it. However, if the price actually decreases rather than increases, the buyers will take a considerable cost to cover the loss. On the contrary, if the price is predicted to decrease, but in reality increase, the sellers’ loss will be relatively small compared with the buyers’ reaction. In summary, the positive is more valuable to look at due to its property of high cost. From both accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics, we can find the best-performing algorithm.

We used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Perceptron and XGBoost to predict. The accuracy results are listed below,

Comparison of tranning and test accuracy

It can be seen that Random Forest is the most impressive algorithm with both highest training and test accuracy among the 6 algorithms.

And ROC-AUC yielded the same conclusion with the largest AUC score out of all the other algorithms,

ROC-AUC of Random Forest

Semi-supervised Algorithms

In the real situation, it is hard to collect massive data as expected, so we came up with the idea to explore semi-supervised algorithms to leverage only part of the approachable data to generate more self-labeling data and then conduct the prediction.

The present semi-supervised learning area has already been developed into a well-established system of knowledge, so I am not going to tell the details of it here. Basically, there are three kinds of semi-supervised learning, active learning, pure transductive learning and transductive learning with plenty of models. Projects with different datasets’ characteristics and ultimate goals should be matched with the proper semi-supervised models. Because our model’s objective function is not convex, we chose to use Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM).

We utilized 100 labeled samples and 1014 unlabeled ones to predict 478 unlabeled test samples. Finally, TSVM got 67% accuracy. Compared to 60% by using supervised algorithm SVM, TSVM shows improvements, which is basically the main use of semi-supervised learning while constrained by a limited dataset.

Comparison of SVM and TSVM

We also made an effort to check out graph-based model, Label Propagation. The methodology of it can be simplified as the following picture,

Graph-based semi-supervised model

However, one of the key input datasets is the labeled data given by experts, which is aimed to constantly improve the labels but we are in a lack of, so in the future, we will dig deeper into this method and try to look for some useful output from it.

Future exploration and reflection

Although our model has rendered a satisfying result, there are still some potential problems needed to be considered. The one that has already popped up is associated with Neural Network which we want to explore in the future.

Within the constraints of the Paradigm NLP formulation(s), Neural Networks (NN’s) can extract information contained in the article at present time, but they cannot extract information associated with future events. That is to say, and as an example, if I am a citizen of Israel and I read that someone-that-matters was assassinated, then being an informed reader with a grasp of not only history but also of retaliatory capabilities, I can infer the consequences of such an act — say economic and/or military retaliation. On the other hand, a complete outsider would read the same article and only gather that someone was assassinated and that this person mattered enough to be written about. NN’s are like the latter.

So we have to figure out if there are ways to get around the gap between the sophisticated readers and the naive readers — but based on ML formulations/approaches.

And for future application, we plan to develop a chatbot to automate our prediction display. The prototype interface is

Prototype interface of Chatbot

It generally has three parts, a chat window for asking questions, real-time BTC price chart for reference and news articles with labels of author and publisher, as well as sentiment score, magnitude and TF-IDF score."

2018 was a crazy year for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as markets dropped significantly in value, but there were still plenty of sensational headlines to capture attention in a period when digital currency news coverage changed drastically. According to statistics from Cryptocompare and alternative research from other sources, media crypto narratives have evolved rapidly.

The Top 5 Crypto Blogs According to Algorithmically Ranked Data

Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies still made headlines in 2018 within the financial technology space. Last year, coverage changed markedly throughout the industry with a bunch of new blogs and individual reporters attempting to cover the space. For instance, the algorithmically ranked data site Detailed ranks 50 cryptocurrency-focused news outlets, with the rankings updated every 24 hours. Detailed utilizes far more advanced web crawling and ranking techniques than can be found from sorting through Alexa traffic and Google Pagerank.

The web portal Detailed uses software called the 8-bitbot, an extremely detailed web crawler that combs cryptocurrency blog ratings and measures the number of followers. According to the website’s algorithmic rankings, the top five digital asset news outlets comprise Coindesk, Cointelegraph, CCN, the Ethereum Blog, and news.Bitcoin.com. The lower bracket of news outlets had much fewer mentions throughout the last six weeks of link data.

Exposing Paid Content

Last year also saw sponsored coverage exposed including promotional ICO posts. Breaker Magazine’s Corin Faife reported in October that more than half of all crypto news publications tested took money to publish undisclosed promotional material. Out of 22 crypto news outlets, 12 said they would publish paid content without disclosing to readers that it was promotional. Two outlets explained they would do it “under certain conditions” and prices for the paid material were quoted between $240 to a high of $4,500 per published request. Faife’s report concludes that many of the news organizations are high traffic websites that rank near the top of Google’s news results. One news publication removed a staff member after Breaker Magazine’s evidence was published.

Trading and Market Headlines Increase

Another study published on Jan. 16 by the analytical data website Cryptocompare shows a significant amount of news coverage changes last year. Using the company’s API, the firm collected metadata from 64,605 articles from 25 news sites throughout 2018. One chart shows how the subjects “bitcoin” and “blockchain” dominated the leading categories of news coverage. Other topics such as trading, mining, ICO, sponsored, exchanges and wallets saw much slimmer coverage.

Cryptocompare Research executive Charlie Humberstone explains in the recent study that trading and market commentary increased in 2018. “As ever, the volatile cryptocurrency markets were a topic of great interest to readers and garnered a large share of news coverage — Despite falling prices, the number of articles about crypto trading and market commentary actually increased as the year progressed,” Humberstone’s research details.

Bitcoin-Related Articles Dominated 2018

Even though there have been enormous amounts of hype surrounding altcoins and tokens over the last two years, the subject of bitcoin has regained dominance. The author remarks that bitcoin-related articles reached a peak of 42 percent by the end of 2018 but blockchain-related material remained prevalent. Digital currency news will continue to trend in 2019 while the way it is portrayed and reported on will evolve further. The bear market has affected some publications, according to Humberstone’s research, as the number of crypto articles dropped considerably from its peak in May 2018.

The cryptocurrency markets have produced a slight retracement in response to bitcoin core (BTC) testing a long-term descending trendline dating back to December 2017’s record highs. The dip has seen bitcoin cash (BCH) slip back below $150, and BTC fail to hold above $4,000. As of this writing, ripple (XRP) has again overtaken ethereum (ETH) to rank as the largest altcoin by market cap.

Combined Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization Loses $11.5 Billion in One Day

The cryptocurrency markets have pulled back following BTC forming a third point of contact with a major descending trendline stemming from the record highs posted nearly 25 months ago.

At approximately 01:00 EDT, BTC fell by nearly 6% within an hour. The move reversed all gains generated by the spike above $4,000 that was posted on Jan. 6, sending uncertainty across the markets.

As of this writing, BTC has a market cap of nearly $66.81 billion and a market dominance of 52.5%. BTC is currently trading for $3,860 on Bitfinex and $3,775 on Bitstamp. The retracement saw the combined capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fall by more than $11.5 billion, dropping from nearly $138.9 billion to $127.1 billion currently.

BCH Loses 15% in Seven Hours

Of the leading markets, BCH was among the hardest hit, shedding 15% against the dollar in just seven hours.

As of this writing, BCH is priced just below $140, the lowest the market has traded since Dec. 20. When measuring against BTC, BCH has fallen by 10% in the last seven hours and is currently trading for 0.036 BTC.

BCH is currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency market with a capitalization of $2.44 billion. BCH has a market dominance of roughly 1.9%.

XRP and ETH Vie for Second Largest Market Cap

As of this writing, XRP is the second largest cryptocurrency market with a capitalization of $14.16. XRP currently comprises 11.05% of the total cryptocurrency capitalization.

Ripple was among the least heavily hit markets by today’s bloodshed, falling 9% in the last seven hours to trade for $0.35 and 3.7% in the last 12 hours against BTC to currently trade for roughly 90,500 satoshis.

XRP was able to dethrone ETH as the second largest crypto market after ETH fell by 12% in less than eight hours to currently trade for $134. When measuring against BTC, ETH fell by 6.5% to trade for nearly 0.035 BTC.

ETH is currently the third largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $14.01 billion and a market dominance of 10.95%.

The volume of the crypto market dropped from $15 billion to $13 billion as the Bitcoin price fell below the $3,600 mark. There was a buzz of concern among analysts regarding the declining volume of digital assets and concerned regarding the potential fall of cryptocurrencies without significant sell pressure from bears.

Generally, at least until digital currencies overcome the last phase of a 12-month long bear market and start a strong accumulation phase, traders and investors in the space of digital currency expect a year free of volatility. Most digital currencies are envisioned by the traders in a low price range.

What Do Experts Have To Say?

Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has driven a wave of panic among the investors. Mitch Blakeway, Head of Trading at Quantatex said, “Despite Bitcoin’s fairly limited use cases, and even though its technology may be less sophisticated when compared to some other projects, it will likely continue to remain the market leader in 2019. Bitcoin still has the reputation and the liquidity that make it preferable to other cryptos.”

Bitcoin had approached this low value earlier in December the last year as well and had had a sharp recovery soon after that. Now with its drop to $3,000 region, it may again initiate a sharp recovery with the aid of big buy walls on major cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges.

Considering the lack of momentum of cryptocurrencies and the inability of dominant digital assets in the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum to breakout of important resistance levels, cryptocurrency technical analyst DonAlt had suggested that 2019 may turn out to be a boring and a low volatile year.

“I’ve been relatively inactive this year – for one reason – there just hasn’t been too much to trade. I wouldn’t be surprised if 2019 plays out like this, boring, choppy and frustrating to trade. The worst thing you can do is force trades when your system doesn’t give you any,” the analyst said.

Will Bitcoin Recover?

Many crypto enthusiasts are positive about the market of cryptocurrency. Slowly many people are realising how cryptocurrencies work and how they are going to benefit them by involving in them and hence people will continue to invest in Bitcoin. The downfall of Bitcoin and others in the industry as well has happened several times before this. Bitcoin had fell to its lowest price in over a year in November last year, which pushed the prices of other major coins down as well. In just 12 hours, the overall cryptocurrency market cap had fallen from $210 billion to $183 billion, losing $27 billion in the process. In November last year.

Way Ahead

If Bitcoin continues to fall below $3,500 and possibly to its 12-month low at $3,122, cryptocurrencies with low market caps and daily volumes are expected to experience intensified downward price movements against both Bitcoin and the US dollar.

There has been speculation among analysts regarding the peaks of the crypto. It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will indeed be able to rise to $40,000 in the current calendar year or not.

The blockchain of Ethereum (ETH) is one of the most useful in the blockchain space, after Bitcoin. A recent analysis of the charts suggests a sharp drop in the price of ETH and the rate of its fall is much higher than the other assets. This downfall has had the investors surprised and is a matter of concern looking at where the digital asset is heading. Tron, a coin that its Chinese founder hopes will challenge the world’s major content providers, such as Facebook and YouTube has also begun to drop its value.

On the other hand, for the cryptocurrency giant Ripple, the bulls have been unable to push Ripple (XRP) above $0.33108. Currently, the bulls are attempting to scale the level again. If this latest recovery attempt fails, a cryptocurrency to drop to $0.27795 is expected.

This downfall could be because of the security loopholes in the finance ecosystem. These attributes have to be given importance for a constant recovery of the crypto market.

How The Crypto Sell Will Help Taxes

Right from Google’s ban on cryptocurrency related ads, the Bitcoin prices have run to an all month low. The volatile cryptocurrency fell by $500 within a six-hour space. If Bitcoin has been purchased and sold within the same year, the person will be taxed on short-term capital gains.

How Will This Affect India?

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are banned in India, but this drop in the crypto market might still affect the country since the second interdisciplinary committee is in favour of legalising it. With more strict rules, this news brings hopes for the cryptocurrencies to enter the Indian market right back. The committee had previously met twice, but there were still ongoing deliberations surrounding it.

“We have already had two meetings. There is a general consensus that cryptocurrency cannot be dismissed as completely illegal. It needs to be legalised with strong riders. Deliberations are on. We will have more clarity soon,” a senior official said. The committee has met twice on the issue and is likely to submit its report to the finance ministry by February 2019."

The world's largest cryptocurrency dropped 9 percent on Thursday morning to a low of $3,570.29, according to industry data site CoinDesk. The sudden and sharp drop brings bitcoin's one-year losses to more than 70 percent.

Other major cryptocurrencies struggled, too. Ether fell 15 percent while XRP dropped 9 percent, according to CoinDesk.

Analysts did not point to any particular catalyst for Thursday's cryptocurrency dip. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, said clients had been asking — but there doesn't seem to be any real reason for this drop, ""neither technical nor fundamental.""

""The one interesting thing about this movement is that it seems to be an exact reversal of the surge that happened on Sunday afternoon,"" Greenspan said. ""At this point, the gains made since the start of the year have now been reversed and we're back to a neutral 2019.""

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have failed to recover to their peaks reached around this time last year. The retail mania has certainly worn off as the entire market capitalization has dropped 85 percent in a year, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Investors had been awaiting more institutional adoption this year, and the launch of a series of bitcoin futures. Both the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE (parent company of the New York Stock Exchange) and the Nasdaq plan to launch bitcoin futures this year, despite the ongoing bear market.

So far, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates bitcoin, has approved two crypto futures products — one from the Chicago Board Options Exchange and another by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Still, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in November that he needs to see better custody solutions surveillance before he would feel ""comfortable"" allowing a crypto exchange traded fund, or ETF, to come to market.

Data from Coinmarketcap showed the knock-on effect of Bitcoin (BTC) aiming downwards Monday, with altcoins in the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap repeating the losses.

Ethereum (ETH) was down 7 percent at press time, just behind the worst performers such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which fell 10 percent.

The overall cryptocurrency market cap has declined to $114 billion, its smallest since mid-December.

Monday’s events spelled the end of a peaceful week for traders, with Bitcoin’s expected average volatility expected at around 3.5 percent daily.

Bitcoin Closes in On 350th ‘Death’

Analysts continue to await the end of the protracted bear market, which has characterized Bitcoin since December 2017. Price forecasts for 2019 put the largest cryptocurrency anywhere from plugging lows of $1300 to setting new all-time highs above $20,000.

“We’ve been in a bear market for a very long stretch, probably the longest in history for Bitcoin right now […] I think right now my personal view is that we are actually overshooting on the lower side now,” exchange Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told a conference last week.

January 26 marked the three-year anniversary of one of Bitcoin’s best-known ‘obituaries.’ Coming from ex-developer Mike Hearn, the 2016 blog post describes Bitcoin as “failed.” At the time, BTC/USD traded at $310.

“It has failed because the community has failed,” he concluded.

Since then, Bitcoin has chalked up a total of 342 such ‘obituaries,’ with 91 deaths in 2018 alone. This year, however, only three have appeared in January since the date of its tenth anniversary.

2018 was a wild ride for cryptocurrencies. Despite the many ups and downs experienced by Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrency vendors, the market has proven that it is going to stick around for the long haul.

Though there is still risk involved in cryptocurrency, investors are coming to better understand the challenges and opportunities associated with this exciting sector. As a result, more people are entering the crypto trading sphere than ever before.

If you’re still new to the crypto investing scene, however, the sheer number of investing options — and new terminology — can feel overwhelming. By taking steps to better understand what you’re getting into, you will make wiser investment decisions.

Here are some tips to get you started on the right track:

1) Know the relation between market cap and circulating supply

New cryptocurrency investors may be intimidated by the new vocabulary they need to learn and how these different terms affect pricing. For example, the “market cap” for a particular coin is used to determine the total value of coins on the market. This number is determined by multiplying the coin’s circulating supply by its current price.

The use of the circulating supply, rather than the total supply, is an important distinction. For a variety of reasons, some coins are not available on the public market. Because they aren’t available for trading, they are not counted toward price considerations or the market cap.

2) Keep up with current market conditions

You can read articles debating the pros and cons of various cryptocurrencies, but current market data will always be the most reliable source for identifying trends and making smarter trading decisions.

Fortunately, there are several websites dedicated to providing up-to-the-minute updates regarding changes in price, supply and market cap. Coincap, CoinMarketCap, and CryptoCompare are just a few examples of resources that help investors stay up to date on current prices. Data that is updated in real-time is paired with charts tracking changes over 24-hour and seven-day periods to give investors a better idea of current trends.

3) Follow the leaders

Even when you have real-time data available, making a trading decision based on a “top 100 cryptocurrencies” list can be intimidating.

However, when this data is paired with guidance from top investors, you can have greater confidence in your decisions and even learn a few extra pointers along the way.

Sites like eToro utilize what is known as a “social trading” program that allows top investors to share their knowledge and trading practices.

New investors can use these traders as a guiding reference or even fully match their investment strategies as they learn the ropes. Picking up good habits early on in your investing journey will keep you from making the impulsive decisions that can lead to disaster.

4) Diversification is vital for success

As with traditional investment opportunities, diversification is essential if you wish to come out a financial winner in cryptocurrencies. With a more diversified portfolio, you reduce your overall risk, especially if you invest in coins and tokens that service different sectors.

This also means you should continue to invest in non-crypto spheres. These practices maximize your potential return while alleviating the risk should a particular coin or stock go under.

You can keep your coins organized and protected with a cryptocurrency wallet. These digital wallets serve as a centralized hub for receiving and sending crypto transactions. Keeping your diversified investments locked in a secure wallet will make it easier to keep track of your investments.

5) Understand which factors influence pricing

What causes cryptocurrency prices to rise and fall? Though supply and demand certainly play a role, crypto investors should carefully consider the perceived utility of a cryptocurrency. If a coin is perceived as having several practical applications, it will be more highly sought-after, and therefore, increase in price.

As MyCryptopedia explains, mining difficulty is another major factor that affects pricing: “A higher mining difficulty means that it is harder to mine an additional unit of a coin. This can have an impact on a coin’s perceived value, and subsequently, its price, as increasing a coin’s supply will require more computing power to be used in the mining process.”

Savvy investors should also pay attention to news headlines regarding different coins and tokens. Positive or negative articles will often have a direct correlation on future pricing trends.

6) Research individual coins and tokens

Cryptocurrencies have frequently been called out as nothing more than a scam by skeptical individuals. While many crypto products have proven themselves to be worthwhile investments, other tokens and coins have indeed been scams, some of which have cost investors millions of dollars.

While this isn’t much of a risk with any of the major, better-known cryptocurrencies, anyone considering investing in a new coin or token should do thorough research before making a trade.

By understanding how a coin will operate within the market, you can determine whether or not it is a legitimate opportunity — and if it is legitimate, you can likely identify whether it will actually be a good investment.

In addition to researching market news, resources like All Crypto Whitepapers can greatly assist your investigative efforts. This site collects all documents highlighting cryptocurrencies’ technical details, marketing plans and more so you can better understand what they have to offer.

7) Prepare for volatility

No one can predict what the market will do with 100 percent accuracy — and this is perhaps truer of cryptocurrency than any other investment sector. Panicking over day to day changes in the market value won’t do you much good. You’re more likely to rush into an impulsive decision and make a trade you’ll later regret.

The stock market provides valuable lessons for handling this volatility, as global stock markets are no stranger to sudden rises and falls in pricing. As such, many traditional lessons and tips for handling volatility are just as applicable to crypto investors.

Many of these practices highlight the value of long-term investments by focusing on a future reward rather than daily price fluctuations. Even short-term investors need to exercise a bit of patience and look at the bigger picture. Understanding that volatility is part of crypto investing, but that you should still experience great growth in the long run, will help you make wiser decisions.

Cryptocurrency trading is expected to increase by 50 percent in 2019 alone.

Despite the seemingly never-ending claims that crypto is a “fad” or already dead, it is clear that this investment option is here to stay. By becoming an informed investor now, you can stay ahead of the curve and be better prepared for future market shifts."
2019-02-21 10:27:00+00:00	Why News of JPM Coin Resulted in Bitcoin (BTC) Gaining in the Crypto Markets	[]	"ethereumworldnews.com Reading time: ~3 m

On Valentines day, crypto traders and enthusiasts woke up to news that the biggest bank in the United States, JP Morgan Chase, will be issuing its own cryptocurrency known as the ‘JPM Coin’. The digital asset will be an internal cryptocurrency used to ease the flow of payments by the bank by instantly settling transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business.

Bloomberg Reports that the Current Bitcoin Rally Was due to the JPM Coin Announcement

5 days later, and on the 19th of February, Bloomberg reported that the recent gains by BTC from $3,600 levels to its current value of around $3,900 was a delayed response frto the news of JP Morgan launching its own cryptocurrency. The Bloomberg report stated the following:

Bitcoin is approaching $4,000 for the first time since the start of the year, as the largest cryptocurrency gets a delayed boost from the announcement last week that JPMorgan has developed a prototype digital coin that it plans to use to speed up payments between corporate customers.

Immediate Backlash from Crypto Twitter

As soon as Bloomberg tweeted the news, crypto enthusiasts responded by ridiculing the report. One user went as far as claiming the report was fake news. The tweet can be found below.

Perfect example of … Fake News — Mr Coins ⚡️ (@CryptoDabbler) February 19, 2019

JP Morgan Launching a Crypto Legitimizes Bitcoin

According to the Abacus Journal, news of JP Morgan launching a cryptocurrency brought renewed interest in the investment of Bitcoin. Proof of this can be seen with the CME Group reporting a record number of Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the 19th of February.

One hedge fund source told Abacus Journal the following.

Every adult with a bank account and a job knows who JP Morgan is. So the announcement of a native cryptocurrency brought interest to a renewed and fresh level that had been diminished throughout nearly all of 2018. My wife even asked me about it the day after it was announced. The huge bounce in volumes in Bitcoin and, for example, Bitcoin futures at the CME are indicative of the wave the announcement caused.

Another source was quick to predict that the JPM Coin might be the catalyst the crypto markets needed to bounce back.

It isn’t that far fetched to foresee a look back in six months and point to the $JPM coin as the catalyst that busted the bear market. Sentiment and narrative play a huge role in what remains a pretty small markets at this point. The JP Morgan news pushed prices higher across the board and those price increases were seriously validated by a surge in volumes.

Summing it Up

Many crypto enthusiasts were quick to dismiss the Bloomberg report that the current increment in value of Bitcoin to near $4,000 levels was a delayed response of the news that JP Morgan was launching its own cryptocurrency. However, with news of a record day of trading for CME’s Bitcoin futures on the 19th of this month, and the input of hedge fund sources to the Abacus Journal, it is worth concluding that the JPM Coin might just have catalyzed renewed investor interest in BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

What are your thoughts on the idea that news of JP Morgan launching their own cryptocurrency is the reason we are seeing Bitcoin (BTC) and all our favorite digital assets gaining in the markets? Does JPM Coin legitimize cryptocurrencies as viable investments? Please let us know in the comment section below.

2019-01-18 00:00:00+00:00	Is Crypto Volatility an Opportunity or Risk?	[]	"Although cryptocurrency markets appear to have calmed down, fluctuations are still the largest among major financial markets. The average daily movement in the last two months has been 4.1 percent.

Catalysts include regulations, system problems, stock market trends and an increase in participants and products. The market reacted the most to stock market trends, followed by system problems such as the hard fork.

Although cryptocurrency also fell as expected in mid-December when the U.S. stock market was hit by a panicked selling, there later emerged a reverse correlation where Bitcoin (BTC) was bought when U.S. equities or the U.S. dollar fell. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency market no longer reacted as much to news such as regulation reinforcement or any increase/decrease in market participants.

The current movement strongly resembles the first cryptocurrency boom and crash in 2013. At that time, prices fell 80 percent from their highs and then took a year and a half to revive. For the time being, the focus will be on monetary easing and the U.S. stock market trends, the start of BTC futures trading by the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Bakkt, approval of the cryptocurrency ETF in the U.S. and progress of various tokenizations.

One Year after the Boom, it Seems the Market Has Stopped Moving

One year from the boom at the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency market cap is $123 billion. That’s about 80 percent below its December 2017 peak. In particular, it seems that movements have completely stopped in the two months since the drop due to Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) hard fork (change in specifications) in mid-November (Figure 1).

However, this is because the previous range was simply to wide. Even today, cryptocurrency is still the most volatile asset, compared with other financial assets. The number of coin types has increased by more than 50 percent in one year. There are currently 2,111 types and the number continues to grow (CoinMarketCap).

The average daily fluctuation rate over the past two months is 4.1 percent, greatly exceeding even the Turkish Lira (Figure 2-1). Moreover, movement is not only in the downward direction. The maximum rate of increase was 12 percent, a similar figure to the decline of 14 percent (Figure 2-2). This rise was due to positive factors such as the release of blockchain-related products by Amazon.com (AMZN) and BCH’s hard-fork problem convergence. Moreover, in December, following the U.S. stock market selloff, there were days when cryptocurrency prices rose 5-10 percent.

Equity Swings Were the Biggest Factor Impacting the Crypto Market

Currently, what are the factors influencing the cryptocurrency market? The days of great cryptocurrency price movements were extracted, and based on the daily news flow, factors were classified as follows: regulations, system problems, stock-market trends, market participants and product increase/decrease. As seen in Figure 3, the price fluctuation range compared to the previous day for each factor was totaled (absolute value, namely, the scale of decline was also totaled as a positive number). The results show that the market responded most to the stock-market trends.

At the beginning of December, there were days when cryptocurrency declined along with stocks in a panicky risk-off mood. However, in the past one month, movements to buy cryptocurrency were conspicuous when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell (Figure 4).

Following stock market trends, the next kind of factor moving the cryptocurrency market was system problems. Especially around this time, the BCH issue mentioned earlier and large-scale updates of Ethereum (ETH) were major factors. However, the market hardly responded to small-scale challenges such as the recent 51 percent attack on Ethereum Classic (ETC), reported by media on January 7, and the hacking of the New Zealand exchange, reported on January 16.

Regulatory news had an additional impact. For instance, BTC rose 4.5 percent when the media reported that the FSA may consider a cryptocurrency ETF on January 7. This report later proved incorrect, pushing down prices by 5.6 percent.

There was a mixed reaction to new participants and products entering the market. Some investors reacted positively to news of a booming ETH-based blockchain game. But the market remained more or less unresponsive to negative news like the contraction of China’s BTC mining giant Bitmain. This was expected to a certain extent.

What are the price catalysts now?

With prices falling this far, it is not easy to become bullish. Still, one ray of hope is the crash and revival seen after the first cryptocurrency boom before the Mt. Gox incident in 2013. As shown in Figure 5, the current cryptocurrency movement resembles the decline after the first big rally. At that time, BTC revived dramatically after sliding 80 percent from its high, and enduring a 1-1/2 year slump.

For the time being, the focus will be on the financial policies and stock market movements in the U.S. Even if the U.S. Federal Reserve stops interest-rate hikes earlier. A weak U.S. stock market could also draw money back to cryptocurrencies.

In addition, the market could see more participants and attention when Bakkt’s BTC futures begin trading. The prospect of a cryptocurrency-related ETF is another catalyst to watch. We also need to keep an eye on the trend toward tokenization. It’s become popular to sell real estate and unlisted stock in small lots via tokens. If these markets become active, cryptocurrency investors will increase and practical uses will become more clear.

Depending on how these trends play out, the revival of the cryptocurrency market is not just a dream."

2019-02-28 15:45:00+00:00	PRIMER: regulating cryptocurrency exchanges	[]	"It seems there has been nothing but bad news for cryptocurrency exchanges recently.

Amid the price collapse, a number of high-profile incidents have cast further doubt on the stability of the market. Most notably, the death of Gerry Cotton, chief executive of Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX, which allegedly resulted in $145 million of investors’ money being frozen in inaccessible cold wallets. Conspiracy theories have naturally followed.

This isn’t the only case to concern potential investors. In 2014 Mt. Gox, one of the first bitcoin exchanges, shut down its operations and filed for bankruptcy. At the time, the exchange handled 70% of all bitcoin transactions, and investors are still unclear as to the state of their investment.

The plethora of hacks on exchanges around the world has had a big impact on prices, contributing to bitcoin’s collapse. Its price is now down from $19,700 in December 2017 to $2,867 at the time of writing. In September 2018, Japanese exchange Zaif was infiltrated by hackers who stole almost $60 million worth of cryptocurrency.

These high-profile incidents have led many to believe that new cryptocurrency-specific regulation is required. It is said that doing so would help protect retail investors, as well as drive out some of the less scrupulous market players.

“Regulation defining minimum standards of risk management framework would address cyber risks and information security,” said a vice president at a regtech firm. “Doing so is important to mitigate operational risks and enhance customer protection.”

What is regulators’ current position?

Cryptocurrency exchanges are a digital marketplace where users can trade digital cryptocurrencies.

One of the major difficulties for regulators is defining precisely what cryptocurrencies are, and the technology associated with the market. There is disagreement as to whether they should be named cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets, for instance. The distinction will affect whether these are regulated as a currency or an asset.

Regulators were initially reticent to regulate cryptocurrencies, given fears that such a move would legitimise a market they were sceptical of. Yet across the globe, many are now putting in place frameworks that will offer clear rules for market participants.

The UK, for example, is in the process of establishing a cryptocurrency framework which is expected to mirror Switzerland’s approach. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published guidance in January 2019, dividing tokens into three separate categories: exchange tokens, not within FCA remit; security tokens, regulated as financial instruments; and utility tokens, which would normally escape regulation.

France is also in the process of creating its own framework. French foreign minister Bruno Le Maire said in March 2018 that he wanted his country to become the capital of ICOs. New regulation is expected imminently, which will force exchanges that conduct fiat to cryptocurrency trades to complete a registration form with the Autorité des marchés financiers.

""A growing number of jurisdictions are recognising cryptocurrencies as something they can use to promote their own financial centre,” said the regtech vice president. “They can attract new exchanges by providing a clear regulatory framework.”

Many exchanges had previously avoided fiat to cryptocurrency trades, as it would mean complying with anti-money laundering (AML) regulation. Yet to improve user convenience, more exchanges are beginning to offer these kinds of trades, even if it does mean they are subject to AML rules. This is part of an increasing trend towards more actively compliant cryptocurrency exchanges.

What changes are being made?

Exchanges have begun to put more emphasis on improving their security after a series of high-profile hacks on platforms. The security demands from users have risen because of an increased awareness of risks in the market. In order to be successful, exchanges need to offer a certain level of trust, and are now beginning to realise this and take active steps to address the issues.

According to Sarah Lewis, counsel at Cleary Gottlieb, to establish trust with market participants exchanges are seeking to differentiate themselves by taking into account the position of regulators. “They are acknowledging that the regulatory position may be uncertain in some jurisdictions, but also that it is evolving,” she said.

There is a risk that too much regulation could disincentivise exchanges from operating in a certain jurisdiction, and even stifle the developing industry. While opinion from governments on cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets is mixed at best, almost all are in support of blockchain. Lawmakers will not want to inhibit the industry and disrupt distributed ledger technology in their country.

New York’s Bitlicence, which businesses need before they can deal in virtual currencies, drove a number of companies out of the state. As of January this year, only 14 licences have been granted to companies. The framework has received widespread criticism for being too restrictive.

“Due to regulatory uncertainty, some crypto exchanges have taken advantage of regulatory arbitrage, and based themselves out of jurisdictions with looser regulatory oversight,” Lewis said. For example, many exchanges are based in Estonia, home to arguably the biggest money laundering scandal in history.

In order to address concerns that bitcoin has been used to launder money, the European Commission adopted the Fifth Money Laundering Directive in April 2018 to include virtual currencies. The massive fall in the bitcoin price after the directive came into force could be coincidental, but it could also be indicative of the scale of the problem before the directive came into force.

Yet legitimate exchanges wanting to conduct business honestly have a difficult task trying to adapt to different rules in different jurisdictions. The situation is also constantly evolving, making it difficult to plan for the long term.

How are exchanges reacting?

Exchanges are responding positively, however. Many are customising their offerings for a selected jurisdiction, for example only offering fiat to crypto trades in selected jurisdictions that have more generous oversight. Some are offering selected tokens in a single jurisdiction. It is clear that overall, exchanges are taking regulation into account, and making changes in response.

There is however scope for improvement, according to Fern Karsh, general counsel at fintech company Catalystic AI. “More exchanges should behave like regulated financial entities,” she said. “They should be getting ahead of regulations and implementing best practices, even in jurisdictions where regulations aren't yet in force.”

Exchanges should implement risk management programmes, run external audits and implement anti-money laundering processes. It is also important to conduct vendor due diligence and cybersecurity checks to avoid the fate of failed exchanges in recent years.

That task is likely to become easier in the coming years after clear frameworks specific to cryptocurrencies have been adopted by the major economies. While the position of regulators is becoming clearer, it is still not certain until these have been implemented. Once it is, significant legal and regulatory risk will be reduced.

This would make it easier to establish important commercial relationships and drive out exchanges with inadequate standards. This could also help to change the negative perception some have about the marketplace.

According to Karsh, the main issues exchanges have to deal with include: securing banking relationships, understanding the regulatory environment, and implementing compliant anti-money laundering practices both domestically and globally. These issues could also be reduced considerably if an effective regulatory framework is implemented.

Yet for some, it is critical that existing banking regulation is not applied.

“The major problem is that regulators are applying existing banking or securities laws,” said Angel Versetti, chief executive of blockchain company Ambrosus. “This inhibits the sector greatly. These regulations were drafted many years ago and do not account for technical developments.”

While it appears that the US is going in that direction – in light of Jay Clayton’s repeated comments that he has never seen an ICO that isn’t a security – Europe looks to be adopting new frameworks specific to the cryptocurrency industry. If it does, this would most likely be welcomed. The hope is that it would arrest the price slide plaguing the industry over the past 12 months.

In the Western world, many people look at cryptocurrencies as an investment, and obsess over their price movements. In Africa, however, cryptos are much more than an investment asset class: they are transforming lives, in the financial services sector and beyond.

One of the most transformative uses for cryptocurrency and blockchain tech has been by Wala, a Ugandan crypto startup. Wala recognized the great challenge that people in Sub-Sahara experience with traditional banking and decided to do something about it. The firm uses the $Dala cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem to facilitate the swift, cheap and efficient movement of funds.

And its reach has gone far beyond just facilitating transfers. The firm has joined hands with the Prince of the Buganda kingdom in Uganda. Together, they are building a blockchain-powered clean energy program that will bring electricity to 25 percent of Ugandan households. Crypto has met Wakanda, and the result is revolutionary.

Bus Drivers and Exorbitant Fees

By now, most people know just how expensive it is to send money across the borders in Africa. The World Bank rates charges in the continent as the highest in the world. Nevertheless, people from different countries venture into their neighboring countries in search of opportunities. If they do find work, they have to send money back home to their families.

That’s when the real effect of those exorbitant charges is felt.

Wala founder Tricia Martinez explains why sending money home is a gamble. In a blog post, Tricia tells the story of Obert, an Uber driver who plies his trade in Cape Town, South Africa but hails from Zimbabwe, a neighboring country.

Obert has to send money home to his family, but the infrastructure in place is either too expensive or inaccessible. He thus has to turn to other methods, and they are as risky as they can get. One method was through bus drivers. The drivers pick up the money from Obert, and a host of others, and deliver it to Zimbabwe at an agreed time and place.

This method is quite risky. For one, Obert has to rely on the trustworthiness of the drivers. Should the drivers run with the money, there’s little he can do. The drivers could also get robbed, losing Obert his hard-earned money. As if these challenges weren’t enough, the service isn’t cheap either. Obert has to part with 7 percent of the transaction amount.

A fast, reliable, cheap and efficient funds transfer channel couldn’t come fast enough for Obert.

The Uptake

Wala launched the Dala protocol and marketplace in April 2018, and the reception was incredible. In its first 30 days, the Wala Android app was downloaded 57,000 times. The app was only available in three countries – South Africa, Zimbabwe and Uganda – making the achievement even more noteworthy. In Uganda, only Facebook and WhatsApp were downloaded more times that month.

As Tricia revealed a month later, the app had 4,400 daily active users who completed 172,000 transactions. These transactions included purchasing of airtime, paying for water and electricity bills and even paying school fees.

As testament to the huge market share that micro-transactions have in Africa, the average transaction was a mere $0.27. The app completes such micro-transactions at zero fees, giving its users further freedom to transact as they wish.

Wala uses the $Dala crypto, an ERC-20 token, to power the Dala protocol. $Dala is a multi-chain crypto which relies on Stellar, to settle transactions, and on Ethereum, for the wallet. While the two companies are related, $Dala is an open protocol and can be used to power other networks.

Transforming Uganda

While Wala is based in Cape Town, South Africa, its biggest impact has been in the East African nation of Uganda. Wala has partnered with CleanPath Emerging Markets (CPEM) and together, they are launching a blockchain-powered gigawatt-scale solar program. The program has also received the support of the Ugandan government through its Ministry of Energy.

CPEM will run its partner and vendor contracts as well as its ledger on the Dala platform, allowing Ugandans who get connected to the grid to pay for their power bills using the $Dala tokens. CPEM workers will also be paid in $Dala.

Tricia explained why this was a natural next step:

“The numbers we’ve seen since the launch of $DALA have been staggering, and a large portion of our current users are Ugandan, so this partnership is a natural next step to allow users the opportunity to further benefit from using $DALA.”

There’s one person who is at the center of this mega move: Prince Kudra Kalema of the Buganda kingdom, who has taken it upon himself to take measures that elevate his people. In an interview with TechCrunch, he revealed that such developments can only be made possible by decentralized systems such as Dala.

Having identified clean and affordable energy as what his people needed the most, he set out to find the most low-cost option. Prince Kalema is the co-founder and managing director of CPEM. Linking up with Dala was only natural as the two share a vision of a better Africa, he explained.

“We began using the $DALA protocol because it became very clear that the financial structure in Uganda was not adequate. It was clear we needed something. There is no way the Uganda shilling is stable enough for the type of program we are doing. Wala was already invested in the same country and wasn’t just about the idea of a running a crypto coin in an emerging market, but was also about creating the best type of financial institutions for the country”

With over 80 percent of Ugandans being under 35 and well-educated, technological advancements such as cryptos can take root easily. Prince Kalema believes that cryptocurrencies could take root in Uganda even more easily than in the U.S.

With cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology and an ambitious leader – the future looks bright for Uganda.

He Believes In The Future Of Digital Currency', 'Enjoys Updating The Public With Breaking News On New Developments In The Cryptocurrency Space.', 'Contact', 'Adrian.Klent', 'At']	"Advertisement

The cryptocurrency market has taken a rather impressive turn since the last 24hrs when most tokens and coins were only making a little above 2% to 4% in gains, but as usual, the unpredictable structure of the market has moved to a more trading friendly position as more and more tokens continue to attain gains.

It is interesting to note that at press time, only 13 coins/tokens are raking in losses, all of which are between 0.10% to 7%. Not only is this current market pattern favorable enough to keep prices on a more stabilized state, but most of the top ten altcoins are also likely to go as far as making a breakout in trading price as trading volume continued to skyrocket.

ETHER

Beginning with Ether, ZyCrypto reported on the possibility of the token surpassing its long term rival XRP to retain the second spot as its market capitalization was heading towards a collision with that of the XRP. Interestingly, that is still the case at the moment of this writing.

Ether seems to have stabilized, and the only difference between now and the last 24hrs is that Ether has moved from $13.10 billion to $13.58 billion against Ripple’s XRP whose market cap of $13.64 as of yesterday has only moved slightly upwards to sit at $13.79 billion at the moment of this writing.

Not only is this good news for Ether traders, seeing that yesterday’s decline of 4% did not deter the token from going up by 10%, the next 24hrs will carry Ether traders on an exciting journey as the token has even gone ahead to break its nearest resistance level to now trade at $130 at press time.

Meanwhile, a few other altcoins like BCH and EOS have followed Ether’s path with gains of 8.74% and 9.76% respectively. This current increase in gains has further positioned both tokens for a highly possible breakout in trading price as both have gradually maintained stability since yesterday. Currently, BCH is trading at $135.98, while 1 EOS is worth $2.49."

The police also said this form of currency was not backed as legal tender by the government and central financial institutions.

""The general public is informed not to make any type of investment in cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies (vcs) such as bitcoin because there is a real and heightened risk associated with them,"" an advisory issued by the Inspector General (IG) of crime branch said.

""This can result in a sudden and prolonged crash, exposing investors; especially retail consumers who stand to lose their hardearned money,"" it said.

The IG said the public needed to be alert to avoid getting trapped in such fraudulent schemes.

Through the medium of this warning notice and advisory, the general public is cautioned against the risks of investing in virtual currencies as these are not backed as legal tender by the government and central financial institutions, he said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not given any license and authorisation to any entity and company to operate in such schemes or deal with bitcoin or any virtual currency, and such cryptocurrencies do not have any regulatory permission or protection in India, the advisory stated.

As there is no regulatory oversight on cryptocurrencies which use blockchain technology, all transactions are encrypted and there is high risk as this platform is used for carrying out subversive activities, smuggling, drug trafficking, human trafficking, terror funding and money laundering, the IG added.

2019-02-18 17:59:21+00:00	Top 13 Latin American Crypto Exchange Startups	['Guest Contributor', 'Please Enter Your Name Here']	"Don't worry, we speak : Español (Spanish), too!

Written by: Patricio Ortiz

Contxto – Cryptocurrencies have been intermittently stalling through muddy waters since they lost almost 80 percent of total market capitalization in the 2017-2018 period. But for Latin Americans, things have been on a “crypto-high” so far in 2019.

As Crypto News recently described, “crypto-mania appears to be hitting top gear” throughout the region. From Altcoins to Stablecoins, to ICOs, STOs or DApps—conceptual evolutions and territorial expansion continue to glide upwards in the Latin American crypto ecosystem.

Perhaps on the down-low, cryptos have been spreading across Latin America without caring too much about things like the tough “bear market.” Regardless of throwing lawyers and institutions for a few curveballs, cryptocurrencies keep finding ways to enhance our lives. I’d say they’re here to stay.

Nonetheless, there have been prevalent issues involving governments adamant about regulating cryptocurrencies. These efforts have turned abusive in some cases. For example, authorities in Venezuela targeted crypto remittances with high inflation rights, bureaucratic procedures, and payment rules.

Latin America crypto frenzy

In recognition of these challenges, I’d still say that cryptocurrencies still have market longevity. Here are quick overviews of some—but not all—of Latin America’s prominent crypto exchanges available on the market. Together, they provide people with easy access to crypto coins, crypto payments, crypto trading platforms, and speedy methods to acquire virtual currencies.

Country: Mexico

Among the top-rated cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America is Bitso. The venture has seen considerable growth in both the number of users along with trading volumes in recent years. All in all, Bitso has proven to be Mexican’s first choice when it comes to getting crypto.

Co-founder Pablo González mentioned to El Economista that, “although the use of virtual assets is still not so common in Mexico, it is estimated that the market size reaches about 800,000 users who have already adopted these types of assets.”

Bitso is currently Mexico’s largest crypto-platform where investors can easily deposit and trade their Mexican Fiat (pesos) from a diversed portfolio. Other altcoins like the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and the True USD (TUSD) are also available.

Country: Colombia

In collaboration with Blockchain Global, this Medellin-based crypto exchange offers a trading platform and payment gateway through Daex Pay. They guarantee users quick, easy, and secure access to users in Colombia and other Latin American countries.

Update (Jan. 21, 2020): Perhaps access was too easy to access, since recently DaexS was forced to close down temporarily due to excess traffic. Find out more here.

Country: Mexico

Beginning in 2014, Volavit claims to be Mexico’s pioneering crypto group, with basically the same KYC and verification terms as practically every other player from this list.

Volabit offers a simple dashboard with market prices listed in Mexican pesos. At the moment, it offers four cryptocurrencies: BTC, LTC, BCH, XRP. Soon it expects to launch a more professional trading platform called VEXBI with more trade facilitation features and e-coin variety.

Country: Colombia

This creative and colorful Colombian platform offers ample access to different coins and trading services with deposits as well as withdrawals available. Unlike other competitors, Panda Exchange stands out for using the innovative PoS (point of sale) Xeller machine permitting customers to pay with cryptocurrency.

It was first deployed at La Tortata sweet shop in Bogota, Colombia.

Country: Argentina

Previously known as Bitpagos until 2017, this Argentinian startup launched in mid-2014 with US$1.9 million’s worth of funding. According to company representative Juan Mendez, Ripio changed its name to distinguish itself from other contenders.

“The decision came as the startup’s mission shifted more toward consumer-facing services. BitPagos is a brand that was too linked to merchants and B2B (business to business) payment processing. Over the last year and a half, we’ve shifted most of our efforts towards users [and] consumers and we needed a brand that suits our mission best.”

Country: Peru

This Peruvian-based crypto exchange fulfills everything that a regular crypto-enthusiast could desire. Most likely, the enterprise feels super accomplished following astonishing trading volumes over the last weeks.

Further, Bitinka announced an integration of its platform with cryptocurrency projects DAI (Stablecoin) and Maker, which is currently ranked at number 17 on the Coin Market Cap list. This probably explains the recent trade surge of investments on the platform.

Country: Argentina

Best known for its Alto Viaje endorsement, this public transport company from Argentina made headlines for making cryptocurrencies a viable payment option. Like others, Bitex offers a simple platform allowing common people to access the most reputable crypto assets such as BTC and ETH.

“We believe that this type of projects are of great importance since they bring access to technology as disruptive as bitcoin to the common people, demonstrating the true value and the real application it has in everyday life”, said Bitex CMO Manuel Beaudroit to Latam Noticias.



Country: Chile

Gaining momentum in Chile is CryptoMarket offering a user-friendly experience for clients. Users can intuitively navigate its simple dashboard to place orders or quickly transfer funds from one asset to another. In terms of portfolio, the company offers XLM and EOS currencies. Both of these monetary units are expected to rule the scene in the near future due to their high currency values.

Country: Brazil

Cryptocurrencies are a hot topic in Brazil following Mercado Bitcoin’s judicial victory against a national bank. According to reports, Banco Sicoob deliberately closed user accounts and broke various laws in the process. Mercado Bitcoin offers a range of cryptos like BTC, LTC, BCH, and BTG, all of which can be quickly and safely accessed with Brazilian reales. Not long ago, another Brazilian crypto-startup called Bitcoin Max fought and also won a legal battle against Santander bank.

Country: Brazil

Some say that Bitcoin-to-You Claims became Brazil’s first crypto exchange when it appeared on the market in 2010. Currently, it boasts a portfolio of 10 cryptos including BTC, LTC and other prominent “alt-coins” like ZCash and BNB (Binance coin). Both the Chicago Stock Exchange and JPMorgan Chase use the company’s platform, according to Bitcoin-to-You’s website.

Country: Chile

This Chilean company previously known as SurBTC has operations in Colombia, Argentina, and Peru. Since its 2015 founding, Buda’s mobile application has gained a lot of attention for its attractive interface allowing users to easily obtain funds in the local currency. The interactive Android/IOS application makes smartphone transactions a piece of cake.

Country: Uruguay

Easy access, friendly presentation, and simplicity—this site has it all. Cryptofacil entered the market’s radar after they partnered with the USA Bittrex exchange. Now, the firm wants to position itself as a leader in the Latin American and Caribbean cryptocurrency markets.

“We developed Cryptofacil to focus on basic customer requirements: a simple and easy to use cryptocurrency platform, with superior customer support, and value-added services in a safe and secure environment,” said Andres Szafran Cryptofacil founder.

Country: Belize

Lo and behold, this Belize-based crypto exchange site has the best GESR (General Exchange Security Rating) than any other from our list. Livecoin ranks just below Bitinka in terms of transactional volume. To boot, the company has a giant portfolio showcasing different crypto assets, not to mention a reliable platform available in hundreds of markets.

It also shouldn’t be surprising that a country like Belize is the ideal place to pursue financial ventures. With cryptos, it isn’t any different. Belize has really embraced this emerging industry, which has helped the country earn global recognition back in 2016.

We will prevail

Among other global regions, Latin American entrepreneurs are steadily making moves in the cryptocurrency market while enhancing their moneymaking capabilities. The use of this new technology in this part of the world has just begun. With that said, we can only imagine that more and more people will eventually become users.

Despite the setbacks, they continue impressing analysts from Fundstrat Global Advisors. The American financial advisory board believes cryptos actually have longterm potential. As expected, more crypto exchanges seem to be popping up every day, some of them even becoming the fastest profit-making unicorn in history.

Against all odds and mainstream media criticisms, cryptocurrencies still represent a new disruptive asset class. Ultimately, they are a promising financial resource for society with untapped potential. Since we couldn’t mention every single Latin American cryptocurrency on the list, at least we can show you all of the exchanges from ICO Rating:

2019-02-28 09:05:57+00:00	Tron (TRX)’s Justin Sun Says The Bear Market Is Over And Binance’s Changpeng Zhao Foresees Increased Crypto Adoption	[]	"The crypto market may be finally free from the claws of the bearish trend that has been lurking around since back in 2018.

The last year has been called by many a year of correction for the market, a year which separated the valuable projects from the useless ones.

2019 is expected to be a better year regarding both prices and crypto adoption all over the world.

Things seem to be moving in the right direction so far, and Tron (TRX)’s Justin Sun believes that the bear market is finally over.

Justin Sun and Binance CEO CZ share new thoughts on the market

In an interview with the Chinese news portal Huoxing24, Sun and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) shared some pretty interesting thoughts on the crypto market.

Sun was asked about the future of Bitcoin and the whole industry, and he replied that BTC has already hit bottom.

He suggested that the year-long bear market has finally come to an end.

On the other hand, he doesn’t think that we’ll be experiencing any breakthrough in 2019 and he predicted that BTC’s price would remain somewhere between $3,000 and $5,000.

Sun also said that “The opportunities for market breakthroughs this year include the explosion of the dapp ecosystem, the large-scale application of the lightning network, and the three major opportunities for BitTorrent’s 100 million users to enter the cryptocurrency market.”

CZ foresees increased adoption for crypto

CZ, on the other hand, said that he is not able to predict the future of BTC or if we’ve hit bottom or not.

He believes that we’re definitely heading towards increased crypto adoption.

Samsung is the latest colossal name to support mainstream adoption. With its new flagship phone Samsung Galaxy S10 which will come with Bitcoin and crypto support, the company is encouraging the crypto mainstream adoption in more ways."
2019-01-03 19:18:25+00:00	Stocks Finally Crack the Cryptocurrency Market	['Jordan French']	"It's been a long time coming, but 2019 will finally see the cryptocurrency market make its mark on traditional finance in a tangible way.

While some will immediately point to Bitcoin futures contracts as evidence that it's already happened -- such as those offered by the CME and CBOE -- these are a simple half-measure designed to let some accredited investors and hedge funds get exposure to crypto volatility.

The real crypto market has been cut out of this equation. Cash settled futures, which represent how Bitcoin is traded on these enormous centralized exchanges, put no pressure on supply or demand for the cryptocurrency itself because at no point during the trade is any real Bitcoin changing hands.

The Jan. 7 launch of a new Nasdaq-powered crypto DX.Exchange is the biggest signifier yet that the status quo is shifting. It's not that institutional finance suddenly cares about including the cryptocurrency community, but that it has realized that cryptocurrency can aid its long-term goals for inclusive, cost-effective and cross-border asset exchange. DX.Exchange will soon offer tokenized stocks on the blockchain in a way that brings these two disparate markets together harmoniously for the first time.

Two Sides of the Same Coin

Cryptocurrency and stocks have been circling each other for years. Take the ICO fundraising model, for instance, which mimics how an IPO issues shares representing equity ownership in a public company. However, tokenholders aren't the same as shareholders and often don't enjoy the same voting rights or accountability, and regulators have already cracked down on the practice.

Additionally, during the cryptocurrency bull market of 2017, many publicly-traded stocks incorporated blockchain into their operations and even their company names, trying to capture some of the mania pushing crypto prices higher.

These are both unsustainable ideas, but not surprising considering that a two-way bridge between the crypto and equity markets is one of the last remaining hurdles for blockchain. Attempts by either market to adopt traits of or circumvent the other are equally untenable. Also, not only has cryptocurrency been shunned by the derivative crypto assets traded today, the financial industry itself now feels isolated from the great things happening in crypto.

Seeing these trends play out, some of the biggest names in traditional finance such as Bloomberg, NASDAQ and MPS Marketplace Securities have put their heads together to offer a solution.

It's coalesced in NASDAQ partner DX.Exchange, which already offers peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies, but in conjunction with these venerable institutions will now be able to issue blockchain tokens that mirror the live share prices of publicly-traded companies. Not only this, but the tokens are physically-backed 1:1 by the shares they represent, so when you send Bitcoin to your DX wallet and exchange it for Facebook Token or Apple Token, for example, you've just diversified your crypto portfolio with real shares in actual companies.

How Does It Work?

An innovative stack of utility supports this simple idea and is maintained by several of the world's biggest financial firms. When a person with Bitcoin or Ethereum wishes to buy tokenized shares of stock, they can simply log in to DX.Exchange and place a buy order for the chosen shares. Simultaneously, MPS MarketPlace Securities purchases and holds the physical shares (not cash-settled futures), while issuing the appropriate number of ERC20 tokens representing the physical shares.

Following this step, tokens are handed to the buyer through DX.Exchange to fill the trade. MPS also stores these shares and adjusts its holdings based on live DX demand. The exchange of crypto-to-stocks is handled by NASDAQ's FIX (Financial Information Exchange) system, a sophisticated messaging protocol used to send and confirm transactions between parties while preventing manipulation.

A Beneficial Blending of Markets

The fact that tokens are physically backed by stocks means that demand from the crypto market for these assets will impact share prices, just as a (potentially) upcoming ETF settled in BTC would provide demand for Bitcoin and impact its price. It also means more liquidity and volume for the stock market, and the chance to trade stocks on a 24/7 basis rather than being shut out at the close.

For cryptocurrency investors and traders, it also represents an opportunity to diversify their crypto-heavy portfolios without transferring in and out of fiat, as well as store their stocks on ERC20 wallets like the Trezor or Ledger Nano S. They can also invest in stocks cross-market, meaning the ability to buy shares of companies in Tokyo as well as those in the U.S. without going through multiple difficult (and for some, impossible) permissions processes.

By far the most important concept is compliance, however. Besides working alongside NASDAQ and partnering with the Bloomberg Crypto Center, DX is also regulated by the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which opens DX to EU customers who demand a regulated and fully-compliant trading experience.

We're slowly entering into an era where the internet of value is being liberated, and strangely enough, it's at the behest of those who once saw blockchain as a harbinger of evolution. As financial institutions and blockchain ideas increasingly find common ground, retail investors will find new opportunities to enjoy the emerging age of democratized finance.

2019-02-06 11:45:46+00:00	Crypto Valley: Why Switzerland is a world-leading location for blockchain companies	['Please Enter Your Name Here']	"Heinz Tännler, President of the Swiss Blockchain Federation, Government Councillor and Finance Director of the Canton of Zug, explains why Switzerland has become one of the world’s leading locations for blockchain companies

In recent years, Switzerland has become one of the world’s leading locations for blockchain companies, enabling a variety of business models to be explored here. Crypto Valley, between Zurich and Zug, is home to numerous companies and organisations in the blockchain sector. Start-ups come to Switzerland primarily because of legal certainty, Switzerland’s world-class infrastructure, and the Valley’s increasingly strong ecosystem.

Moreover, the willingness of political decision-makers to maintain and enhance Switzerland’s attractiveness for new technologies and companies, as well as the Valley’s proximity to universities has also contributed to the expansion of the sector in Switzerland.

An example of this dynamism is the establishment of the “Swiss Blockchain Federation” last October, a public-private partnership for the strengthening of blockchain technology in Switzerland. The publication of the Federal Council’s report on the optimisation of the legal basis for distributed ledger technology and blockchain in Switzerland at the end of 2018 also provided an important impetus.

Legal certainty is of great importance

Companies are in need of legal certainty, as transactions and business activities based on blockchain technology cannot always be clearly supported by the existing legislation. In order to ensure the breakthrough of the blockchain technology and the success of the companies involved, it is critical that business operate on a long-term, secure legal basis.

The publication of the report by the Federal Council marks an important step in this direction and provides a detailed survey of the legal challenges that these new business models create. The report does not call for a separate blockchain law, preferring to amend existing civil and financial market law. This reflects the objective of setting the framework conditions necessary so that Switzerland can strengthen and extend its leading position in blockchain.

Switzerland is taking a pragmatic approach, which is in line with proven Swiss principles and is to be welcomed. The Federal Council report must now be quickly followed by its legislative implementation because Switzerland needs this certainty for the basis for further development. A 10-point programme launched recently by the Swiss Blockchain Federation to strengthen blockchain technology in Switzerland also calls for a binding agenda from the regulator. The programme spells out the social policy, regulatory, and public interest issues that need to be settled if Switzerland is to be a successful blockchain location.

Excellent starting position

In comparison to other countries on the international stage, Switzerland has “excellent cards because it has good prerequisites as well as entrepreneurs, developers, scientists and doers,” said the Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer on 3 December 2018 at the opening of the “Infrachain”, the first blockchain conference for the public sector and infrastructure companies in Bern, the Swiss capital.

“Blockchain applications will explode in the next few years, and Switzerland is one of the leading developers of blockchain technology and its applications,” Maurer added. This should encourage start-ups to set up their business in Switzerland.

The number of blockchain companies in Crypto Valley is growing rapidly. In December 2018, over 750 companies with over 3300 employees in Switzerland were registered on CV Maps, an online directory of the Blockchain industry. Numerous sub-sectors of the blockchain industry are represented in Crypto Valley, from HealthTech to data analytics to e-government. The 50 largest blockchain companies had a market capitalisation of around $20 billion as at the end of December 2018.

Public administrations are also using blockchain in Switzerland: The canton of Geneva is testing electronic identification and the use of digital signatures for its commercial register. Schaffhausen operates an e-government platform on blockchain in collaboration with a start-up company.

Too important not to be used

In a World Economic Forum analysis, six sources of value creation through blockchain have been identified: the simplification of internal operating procedures, more efficient interaction between regulators and supervised financial firms, the reduction of counterparty risks in transactions, time savings in the handling of financial transactions, better use of a company’s equity or liquid assets, and a greatly reduced risk of fraud. The Internet has changed the way we communicate, and blockchain is changing the way we trust each other.

The still young technology with its countless application opportunities will shape our future and is indispensable. Switzerland is determined to play a leading role as a location for successful companies.

2019-01-14 23:25:51+00:00	Tron (TRX)’s market cap is up by 40% in 2019 already	['Ali Qamar']	"The cryptocurrency market has had a terrible time since December 2017. It hit the roof on December 17th, and it’s been going down like a led balloon ever since then. The market’s value has gone down by 80%, more or less in 13 months and it’s been an unmitigated disaster for almost every blockchain project in the world.

But in the midst of the chaos that the bears have caused in crypto, two projects have managed to gain ground: Tron and Ripple. In this article, we’ll focus on Tron’s recent growth in terms of the token’s value and market capitalization.

As we write this, Tron is trading at $0.025420 which is not exactly impressive compared to Bitcoin, for instance, but only a month ago, it was at half the price. Also, although it’s trading in green numbers but can turn into the red at any time, which is not the best thing either, but many days in crypto are just like that.

Let’s focus on the parameters that really matter.

A few weeks ago, Tron was ranked 11th by market capitalization. But it’s been growing in relative value so, about a month ago, it reached the 10th position, and only a few days ago, it went to the 9th place which is the spot it currently holds.

This is quite meaningful because it means that Tronix’s market capitalization has grown by 40% since the new year began. That’s only 15 days now. And things are just getting started.

$TRX's marketcap has grown by over $500M and is UP 40% in 2019. We are only 10 DAYS into the year. More and more money will continue flowing into #Tron as new DApps continue to join the ecosystem & #ProjectAtlas comes to fruition.#TRX is just getting started! 🚦 — TRX Colony (@TronColony) January 10, 2019

Tron is barely more than a year old, and the platform’s catalog of decentralized apps is still tiny when compared to Ethereum or EOS. And yet, with that limited number of apps and use cases, it’s managed to keep growing at a rate that no other cryptocurrency can currently boast.

So what does the future hold for TRX’s price? Good news, mainly.

New dApps are being developed, and the Tron Foundation is investing a lot of money in incentivizing the community’s developers to build and deploy all kinds of new games and apps for the platform.

Some essential projects are also migrating from Ethereum and EOS to Tron because the networks are slow, expensive and troublesome. Every new app is a new use case for the token. Every new use case increases demand and trade volume which, in turn, will keep driving the price up.

And that’s nothing compared to what Project Atlas will do. Project Atlas will merge the BitTorrent network (the largest decentralized network in the world) with Tron’s blockchain, and it will reward seeding users with a Tron-based token called BitTorrent Token. We are talking about a hundred million users, located everywhere around the planet, that will become members of the Tron community (maybe unknowingly), and that will create yet another use case for the Tron-based token economy.

Tron is proliferating while most other blockchain projects are shrinking. And, as things stand, it will keep growing, and it will be much faster sooner rather than later.

So the current growth rate for Tron is nothing to be surprised. The project is useful; the community is committed, it keeps finding new use cases, more Tron-based tokens, apps and smart contracts are being issued all the time. Tron can only keep growing.

2019-01-08 12:31:46+00:00	The new Bitcoin? Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google in blockchain trade - Is this the next big thing in the crypto world?	[]	"Even if many are still confused and find it difficult to draw an accurate trajectory for cryptocurrency star Bitcoin due to its high volatility, yet the majority would agree that blockchain world is the next big thing in the history of markets. Sure, the attention towards the blockchain market was courtesy of Bitcoin’s blockbuster performance, but there is a sudden change and its an experimental zone for traders. Who would have thought that from Bitcoin, there will be another platform as well and this would be more attractive. Yes, you have read it right, its a new reality! An exchange named as DX.Exchange is offering digital stocks apart from major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ripple.

To your surprise, these digital stocks are none other than major FAANG stocks namely Apple, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet Inc, Intel, Microsoft, and Google. If this is not enough, then one can even trade in Elon Musk’s Tesla, Baidu, and Nvidia.

DX.Exchange which is an Estonia-based crypto firm launched a trading platform for above mentioned digital stocks. In its notification, the exchange stated that users can trade digital stocks using tokens on the Ethereum blockchain platform through smart contracts.

Such is believed to bridge the gap between real world stocks using crypto and tokenized platform.

Daniel Skowronski, DX Exchange CEO says, “By tokenizing stocks of some of the biggest publicly traded companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and more, DX is opening an untapped market of millions of old and new traders around the globe cutting out the middleman.”

In Skowronski’s view, “Tokenizing securities is the first true use case where crypto collides with the real world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With fractional ownership and no leverage like CFDs, these new digital stocks are a ‘more sound’ and safer investment that traders can take home in their wallet. This is the future of securities not just new issues but all the thousands of listed securities around the globe.’’

If you look at DX.Exchange trading platform, the share price of Apple, Facebook, Netflix, Tesla, Nvidia, Baidu, Microsoft and Amazon are in positive note. Not only this, their market price is higher compared to valuation on Nasdaq.

For instance, Tesla share price is at $359.06 on DX.Exchange, higher compared to $334.96 on NASDAQ on Monday. Similar is the case of other digital stocks.

Additionally, the exchange also gives estimated buy and selling price for users to place their bet.

It surely is a meet of titans on this exchange. What is the interesting situation is that digital stocks can become the next big thing in cryptocurrencies market. In fact, can even shift investors attention from Bitcoin.

Why? It’s all in the name! These digital stocks are brand in their own and have a trust due to their robust operations, reach and management. Whereas many are aware that Bitcoin is backed with unanimous investors and founder, not only this, the world is divided in two opinions for having an appetite for the digital currency. There is one section of experts including equity king Warren Buffett who sees Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as nothing but a bubble which will meet its fate.

On the other hand, there is another section of experts who believe Bitcoin is changing the phase of cryptocurrencies in the world and may change even the global financial system. There is a new history witnessed in internet technology trading platform. Bitcoin has created a new change in internet trading which has given freedom to investors.

Bitcoin became so popular that it spawned many other cryptocurrencies. In fact, it actually made a gateway for cryptocurrency markets because since its glorious days began in 2017, there are now some 2,068 cryptocurrencies present for trading with a market capitalisation of $114.11 billion.

This was not the case a year ago, as during that time Bitcoin alone had a market valuation of $326 billion.

In fact, on December 11, 2017, Bitcoin has just earmarked a level of $19,357 which was breathtaking, has even crashed to $3,500-level last year.

For instance four years ago on December 1, 2014, the price of Bitcoin stood at $957.82, if we consider this then Bitcoin gave nearly 1,921% return to its investors on December 11,2017. If we compare the performance of before 2014, then Bitcoin made many rich. It needs to be noted that, Bitcoin has also touched under $1 mark and even $10 mark between 2009 - 2013. In fact, Bitcoin has been a bubble that burst several times.

But make no mistake there is no denying that, Bitcoin is the game changer of Blockchain world.

Dr. Rajkumar S. Adukia, an author of 200 plus books and winner of National Book Honour award 2018, says, “The introduction of Crypto Currencies, specifically Bitcoin, has brought the concept of blockchain technology into the mainstream.”

Adukia explains that a blockchain is a continuously growing distributed database that protects against tampering and revision of data. One of the best things about the blockchain is that, because it is a decentralized system that exists between all permitted parties, there’s no need to pay intermediaries (Middlemen) and it saves you time and conflict.

He also accepts that Blockchains have their problems, but they are rated, undeniably, faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional systems, which is why banks and governments are turning to them.

""Today, the acceptability of blockchain is likely to be more on the premise of open source collaboration attracting rigorous protocols and standardization. After the success of Bitcoin, all major banks and financial institutions are contemplating implementation of Blockchain by separating currency from the blockchain and using it for other inter-organisational cooperation. This can be called as second innovation in the Blockchain concept,"" said Adukia.

Simply put, it’s no more about Bitcoin, it more like a Blockchain world! Now that major FAANG stocks including Tesla, Baidu are in blockchain trade available 24X7 for trading, it would be quite interesting to see if they also create a new history just like Bitcoin. Or cruelly, take control of blockchain world."
2019-02-21 13:13:02+00:00	Cryptocurrency: Technical & Fundamental analysis	['Matt Johnes', 'Maxim Roslyakov', 'Julia Gerstein', 'John Stevens']	"Cryptocurrency is a new asset class and since its rise in 2017 many people consider crypto as an investment opportunity. In traditional finance the asset’s attractiveness is usually estimated through fundamental or technical analysis. Cryptocurrency traders also successfully apply these methods to cryptocurrencies. What is fundamental and technical analysis and how exactly they can be applied to the rapidly changing crypto market?

Fundamental analysis aims to estimate the intrinsic value of the asset by taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors. It is good for estimating an asset’s attractiveness in the long run. In traditional finance, fundamental analysis includes macroeconomic factors (overall economy and industry) and microeconomic factors (company’s numbers, financial indicators and perspectives). The goal is to estimate whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued at this particular point and make a move accordingly.

The procedure of fundamental analysis for stocks and equities has been established long ago, but it can be tricky to apply it to crypto assets since the industry is still evolving. The closest thing applicable to crypto market from the world of traditional finance is a fundamental analysis procedure of a start-up. It’s not always possible to get reports on earnings, revenues, profit margins or other relevant data in crypto industry, which makes it similar to a start-up with little information and financial results available.

How do you estimate fundamental value of cryptocurrency? First of all, conduct crypto market analysis and research on technology’s potential. The questions you should be asking yourself are: Is the technology innovative? How many people/projects actually use it or would benefit from it? What is the market share of the project? Who is the team behind the project and what they’ve already achieved? How many partnerships does the project have and what is the nature of the partnership? After answering all these questions you may draw a conclusion if the asset is worth considering and how risky would be investing in it. You may read here an example of fundamental analysis conducted by our team on Ripple.

Technical analysis is a quantitative method that estimates an asset’s price movements. It focuses more on price figures and charts, than on the reasons behind them. It’s an essential part of intraday and other short-term trading activity. Since statistics is the cornerstone of technical analysis, it doesn’t differ a lot in crypto and in traditional finance. Technical analysis consists mainly of reading charts on certain timeframes and looking into different indicators, trend lines and indices. With technical tools you’ll be able to determine which way the trend is going, whether an asset is overbought or oversold, to what level the asset’s price will fall. The slight difference between technical analysis in traditional finance and cryptocurrency is that the crypto market is more volatile and therefore traders often use log graphs to mitigate the volatility and detect trends.

As you see, fundamental and technical analysis can be applied to crypto market as well although with some peculiarities. Before investing in some coin, make sure to conduct fundamental analysis and find out if the coin has prospective for growth or it has been overpriced. Don’t forget to look into technical indicators as well, they are very handy in determining whether the asset is overbought or oversold. If you’re a day trader, no need to mention that technical analysis’ tools should be your best friend. Automated crypto trading also makes life easier for day traders.

2019-01-04 09:36:57+00:00	2019 cryptocurrency market to see “considerable expansion”	['More This Author', 'Lucy Ingham']	"The 2019 cryptocurrency market will see significant growth due to the backing of institutional investors, according to the CEO of a leading financial advisory organisation.

Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, argues that the weak crypto market of 2018 is now behind us, pointing to the growth of several key cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, over the past few days.

“The bearish sentiment of the last quarter of 2018 is now, I believe, behind us,” he said.

“We can expect the current upswing to continue, albeit with peaks and troughs as in any financial market.

“2019 will be a year of accelerated maturation for the crypto sector due to institutional investment.”

Institutional investment to drive 2019 cryptocurrency market growth

For Green, 2019 is the year that the cryptocurrency market will be embraced by large-scale institutions.

“In 2019, the cryptocurrency market is set to radically evolve. We can expect considerable expansion of the sector largely due to inflows of institutional investors,” he said.

This will mean investment beyond the finance industry, with both companies and government organisations getting involved in cryptocurrency.

“Major corporations, financial institutions, governments and their agencies, prestigious universities, and household-name investing legends are all going to bring their institutional capital and institutional expertise to the crypto market.

“The direction of travel has already been on this path, but there is a growing sense that institutional investors are preparing to move off the sidelines in 2019.”

Regulations key to institutional support for 2019 cryptocurrency market

Key to this move is the increased level of regulatory support and protection offered to investors in cryptocurrencies compared to several years ago.

“The acceleration of institutional investment is likely to be driven by greater regulatory clarity,” he explained.

“More and more global jurisdictions can be expected to join the likes of Malta, Hong Kong, Japan and Switzerland in becoming crypto-friendly from a regulatory and pro-business viewpoint."
2019-02-28 11:52:06.911000+00:00	Challenges and issues in cryptocurrency trading: beyond the controversies	['Cassiopeia Services']	"Challenges and issues in cryptocurrency trading: beyond the controversies

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are often portrayed as the big challenger to the current financial system, promising to fight corporate red tape, increase financial inclusion and create a more just and transparent economy. While all this is true, it’s not always rainbows and unicorns in the crypto world.

Different cryptocurrency exchanges can offer various types of cryptocurrencies and have different terms, policies, payment methods, and fees. Exchanges also differ on aspects such as security, user-friendliness, functionality, and design. These factors can all play a significant part when choosing the most suitable exchange.

Talks over regulation of digital currencies and crypto exchanges are a way to help the market become healthier and more transparent. Cryptocurrencies and exchanges indeed have many issues to address and challenges to overcome. Here, we highlight some of the main concerns and recent issues that are preventing the crypto revolution from progressing to its next stage.

Security

The biggest problem currently in the crypto market is the lack of security. Indeed, with news of hackings and breaches often making headlines, users are demanding more protection over their assets and data.

It is important to remember that as technology becomes more sophisticated, so do hackers. Exchanges are essentially so vulnerable to hacks because they centralise the risk, so further decentralisation can be an option in the pursuit for maximum security.

Security is indeed an urgent and weighty matter. Coin Desk reports that each day, $2.7 million is stolen from exchanges, with the amount of cryptocurrency taken in 2018 having increased 13 times compared to the previous year. This amounts to $2.7 million in crypto assets being stolen every day, or $1,860 each minute.

Transparency

Indeed, it is a well-established fact that the majority of ICOs end up unsuccessful — some of them even fraudulent. Furthermore, many expensive crypto projects often make a case for themselves claiming they are decentralised, when in reality, data from Token Analyst for Yahoo Finance showed that nearly 80% of the top 50 coins are held by the top 20 wallets. In 16 cases, the 20 biggest wallets held more than 90% of total token supply.

Much like in the more traditional economy, power dynamics also underline the negotiations and collaborations set in the crypto sphere, and the nuances of marketing strategies can mislead users and investors.

The lack of transparency, accountability and professionalism from renowned institutions can poison the benefits of digital currencies and undermine the strength and influence of blockchain adoption in different industries beyond finance. True blockchain believers call for an end to sketchy practices in the financial system and market structures, promoting widespread professionalism and ethical standards.

Credibility

Initial Coin Offerings are a great way to attract investors, but part of them resulted to be scams. Exchanges need to be careful and strict enough only to list those crypto coins which are reliable and ensure that the right assessment is performed.

Trading fees

Some exchanges charge a single flat fee, for example, 0.2% of the transaction value, on all trades. But many exchanges split their trading fees into two separate fees: the maker fee and the taker fee.

In some cases, maker fees can be higher than the taker because the maker adds liquidity to the market, so the exchange ‘rewards’ the trader.

Liquidity

Liquidity is a vital element for any of the market. A lack thereof creates an imbalanced environment, and things go out of control. Due to the decreased liquidity, orders are not placed/executed on time, and the doors are open for large holders to manipulate prices. Additionally, with a lack of liquidity, markets become more volatile and see more price slippages.

A secondary issue of reduced liquidity is that it puts the power into the hands of cryptocurrency exchanges with large liquidity. Some major exchanges now charge up to $1 million to get tokens listed, essentially selling liquidity to the token projects.

Price manipulation

Currently, the majority of crypt exchanges are only lightly regulated, leaving room for sometimes shady or abusive manoeuvres. It is reported that crypto exchanges use bots to manipulate the prices of coins. Last September, cryptocurrency trader and analyst Alex Kruger exposed a promotion on Bithumb which inflated the trading volume on the exchange.

“There currently are $250 million [in] fake volume traded at [the] Korean crypto exchange Bithumb, every day at 11 a.m. Korean Time, since Aug. 25. Bithumb offers 120 percent payback of trading fees as an airdrop. Trading fees are 0.15 percent taker. To collect the full KRW 1 billion rebate, a wash trader must thus trade KRW 278 billion. That is $250 million in daily fake volume. Notice how 31K Bitcoin is traded at exactly 11 a.m,” Kruger explained.

Transaction Delays

While cryptocurrency transactions are known for being fast, delays can happen and can be a way to protect users from hackings or fraudulent transactions. Exchanges sometimes delay transactions if they suspect the user did not authorize the transactions.

Regulation

In light of these flaws and loopholes, and continuing cases of hacks and breaches of exchanges, regulations would be welcomed if tailored to ensure transparency and consumer protections.

Crypto experts have anticipated 2019 is on track to be the year of crypto regulations

This year started with stronger calls for rules and regulations all around the world. In January, two major European regulatory bodies, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have publicly called for better assessments of crypto technology and its impacts to develop appropriate regulations.

In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is applying their regulatory guidance to cryptocurrency projects as it considers another form of securities.

Recent controversies over exchanges ’ lack of professionalism and transparency are likely to prompt exchange regulations to be in place soon.

Decentralisation

Over the last few months, we have been seeing more moves from centralised exchanges towards decentralisation. Binance, for example, announced earlier this month that it is about to launch its decentralised exchange, Binance DEX, for public testing.

There various advantages to decentralisation. A DEX ensures the poor and unbanked can participate in the global economy: anyone can store and transfer wealth to anyone anywhere in the world, almost at no cost. Another benefit of decentralised exchanges is that users are fully in control of their data as there is no central authority storing or managing it.

How does the future look like?

While centralised crypto exchanges have been the tradition so far, they have somewhat given way to the decentralised crypto exchanges. The main objective behind bitcoin and blockchain is decentralisation and thus, both the CEX’s and DEX’s should come together to develop a hybrid model which benefits all of the crypto ecosystem.

Hybrid crypto exchanges can represent a viable option that bridges the gap between the benefits of a centralised exchange and those of a decentralised exchange. This is the way to gain the trust of numerous users and the cooperation of huge investors, while eliminating the element of subordination to a third-party and ensuring reliable storage.

If there is one thing we can learn from the recent developments and news, it is to look at the shortcomings of the so-called transparent crypto sphere, realise there is plenty of work to be done in this realm, and use the combination of technology, knowledge and accountability to fight these flaws. For the blockchain & crypto revolution to produce its best outcomes, it is important to address the factors that undermine its integrity.

2019-01-31 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin is about to do something it has never done before — hint: it’s not good	['Aaron Hankin']	"For those bitcoin enthusiasts hoping to put 2018 behind them, 2019 hasn’t got off to the best of starts with the most famous digital currency on track to log yet another losing month.

Barring a minor miracle, January will mark the sixth consecutive losing month for bitcoin — something it has never managed before, according to Dow Jones Market Data, which dates back to July 2010.

The streak began on Aug.1 with bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.76% trading above $7,700. Since then it has tumbled more than 50% with the darkest days coming in November when it crashed through support at $6,000, falling to as low as $2,500 a coin.

Bitcoin’s

So with January coming to an end, will February end the unpopular record?

Probably not, if you ask Travis Kling, founder and chief investment officer of Ikigai Asset Management. He believes there’s more pain to come, arguing the industry needs a shake-up before the tide can truly turn. “More exchanges gone. More projects shuttering. More SEC enforcements. More ‘crypto is dead.’ Only then do we move higher,” he tweeted.

Market analyst Jani Ziedins also has reservations about the future of the nascent technology.

“There are cases like the dot-com bubble where the revolution was legitimate, the investors just got excited a little too early. Will bitcoin do the same in 10 years? I have my doubts,” he said in an email to MarketWatch.

“First, the magical thing about bitcoin was that by design it has a fixed supply. That was supposed to prevent manipulation and inflation. Bitcoins would get more valuable as time went by and their popularity increased. And that would have worked in a bubble. But bitcoin didn’t operate in a bubble and its popularity attracted countless copycats that greatly diluted the cryptocurrency market,” he said.

On the plus side, the cryptocurrency has logged gains in February each of the last four years.

On Thursday, a single bitcoin was fetching around $3,450, down more than 80% from its all-time high near $20,000.
