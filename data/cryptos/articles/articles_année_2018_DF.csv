2018-01-17 00:00:00+00:00	Here are all the theories explaining the crypto market crash	['Oscar Williams-Grut']	"The cryptocurrency market has lost $340 billion of value since the start of January, with a severe sell-off on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

Analysts are variously blaming: concerns about regulation, light trading volumes in Asia, bitcoin futures, and an unsustainable price run-up.

Expect the volatility to continue this year, experts say.



LONDON — Bitcoin dropped below $10,000 on Wednesday, almost 50% below its December peak, as the cryptocurrency market entered the second day of a major sell-off.

Almost all major cryptocurrencies fell on Tuesday and the market slump has extended into Wednesday. The combined value of the more than 1,400 cryptocurrencies in circulation has now fallen from over $800 billion at the start of January to around $460 billion at Wednesday lunchtime, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.com.

The causes for the sell-off are far from clear, with several theories making the rounds. Here's a roundup of what analysts and market participants are saying:

Worries about a regulatory crackdown

The most popular theory among market commentators is that fears about a regulatory crackdown in Asia are driving the sell-off.

Fiona Cincotta, an analyst with City Index, said in an email on Wednesday: ""The sell off comes amid concerns of fresh crackdowns on virtual currencies by the South Korean and Chinese government and as governments across the globe are struggling as how best to regulate bitcoin.""

Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst with Forex.com said in an email on Wednesday: ""Cryptos have been held back in recent days amid increasing levels of scrutiny from regulators, most notably in South Korea, where the government is planning to clamp down on trading in virtual currencies.

""The justice ministry is apparently working on a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges. If the bill is eventually passed by the National Assembly it would be very bad news given that South Korea is the world’s third-largest market for cryptocurrencies. The uncertainty is weighing on investor sentiment.""

FXPro said in its daily client email on Tuesday: ""The market seems overwhelmed by rumours regarding a complete currency ban in South Korea and the prohibition of mining in China due to high electricity consumption. What’s more, it was today reported that Chinese financial authorities plan to block domestic access to cryptocurrency trading platforms.""

Asian volumes tailing off

Investors are already getting a taste of what a market without South Korean activity could look like and this may also be playing a role in the cryptocurrency ""bloodbath.""

Mati Greenspan, an analyst with trading platform eToro, told Business Insider on Tuesday that volumes from Japan and South Korea had been tailing off in recent days. Traders in these markets are usually buyers and a large scale exit could have created an imbalance in the market, with more sellers than buyers driving down prices and sparking a panic.

""As we noted yesterday, there's been a trend from South Korea and Japan of lower volumes these last few weeks,"" Greenspan said in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""That did indeed come up a bit yesterday but is still nowhere near what it was in November/December.""

The Bitcoin futures theory

Greenspan provided the below graphs showing how Korean won bitcoin volume has recently declined:And a similar chart showing the same trend with Japanese yen bitcoin buying:Greenspan said the pickup in volumes on Tuesday shows ""that the two countries, especially Japan, are indeed starting to nibble at the lower prices. Indeed, the premiums have also come down a bit and price in the top two cryptotrading countries are now more normal compared to the rest of the world.""

Perhaps the wildest theory for what is driving the cryptocurrency crash is that the maturing of the first bitcoin futures contracts to blame.

Cboe and CME Group both introduced bitcoin futures contracts in mid-December, allowing institutional investors such as hedge funds to speculate on the future price of the digital currency.

The first bitcoin contracts, which are cash-settled, matured on Wednesday, January 17. The contract's settlement price is determined by a price auction on the Gemini exchange at 4 p.m. on Tuesday and some people are speculating that aggressive selling activity could have been used to drive down the price of bitcoin on the exchange to turn the futures contracts into winning bets.

""Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that as little as a million dollars could be used to shore up futures positions and influence the auction market,"" said EthNews.com's Matthew Da Silva, who reported on the theory.

CNBC, which also floated the idea , reported that Cboe's January 17 maturing bitcoin futures were priced at $10,000 on Tuesday afternoon, meaning that holders, in theory, had an incentive to push the price down by selling bitcoins they may have held as a hedge.

A popular Reddit thread has sprung up floating this idea, saying a sudden drop in the bitcoin price could have spooked the market.

""It's always fun to spin these types of stories but personally I don't buy into it,"" Greenspan told Business Insider.

""Number one, the entire market crashed, not just bitcoin. All the altcoins plummeted as well and Wall Street only has access to the bitcoin futures, which is fairly disconnected from bitcoin itself and certainly from the likes of Litecoin and Dash.

""Second point, the volumes that have been traded on these futures contracts are not sufficient to move the markets.""

Greenspan said that the total trade of Cboe's January 17 bitcoin contracts was around $1 billion in the month since they launched.

""Daily market volume on bitcoin is today $14.5 billion,"" he said. ""$1 billion over the course of a month, I don't think is going to tickle anything.""

Thomas Bertani, the CEO of cryptocurrency wallet company Eidoo, which has its own cryptocurrency, agreed with Greenspan. Bertani told BI: ""It might have played a role, but those price movements are all but new.""

A correction that was a long time coming

Bertani thinks the biggest factor driving the crash is the market overheating. Bitcoin rose by over 200% between October and December of last year as huge numbers of new investors poured cash into the sector.

Other cryptocurrencies rose alongside bitcoin and many market watchers argued that this created unsustainable bubble-like market conditions. The recent crash is just some of the air coming out of the bubble, Bertani argues.

Pawel Kuskowski, the CEO of Coinfirm. Coinfirm

""The last year has seen once again a massive growth and hype cycle (like it did already several times before) which needs to go back to normal after the current hype has reached its peak,"" he said. ""This is most likely what is going on now.

""The hypothesis of South Korea banning cryptocurrencies, more than a driving factor, is really just an excuse for the market to rest down for a little bit before continuing with its continuous growth.""

Pawel Kuskowski, the CEO and founder of Coinfirm, which provides cryptocurrency compliance services, told Business Insider on Wednesday: ""It's a correction, a long-expected correction.

""It was just for too long going up and up and up. Ether, in two months, went up from $300 to $1,300. That's absurd. Just crazy.

""I think there are some positions that are being closed at the moment but I don't think it's going to be a big negative impact. The correction was quite needed because it was just absurd what was happening.""

Expect more volatility

While Kuskowski doesn't expect any long-term negative impact to the sector from the currency sell-off, he does think that we are likely to see more of this type of volatility for the foreseeable future.

""I think it's going to stabilise probably not this year but probably within three or four years,"" he told BI. ""You're going to have more checks and balances. But in principle it's going to be a crazy world for another one year, two years, that's for sure. You're going to see more and more volatility, but then it's stabilisation.""

Christopher Keshian, managing partner and cofounder of Apex Token Fund, agreed, saying in an email: ""The volatility of bitcoin — and other cryptocurrencies — is an expected, and important, part of the journey to becoming a mature asset class.

""We expect the volatility to continue throughout 2018 but fundamentally believe that bitcoin is still in a bull market."""

A look at the market's most recent session (18:00 to 24:00 UTC) indicates litecoin, bitcoin and IOTA all gained more than 5 percent in the 6-hour span (despite being down on the day).
2017-12-11 00:00:00+00:00	Statement on Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings	[]	"The world’s social media platforms and financial markets are abuzz about cryptocurrencies and “initial coin offerings” (ICOs). There are tales of fortunes made and dreamed to be made. We are hearing the familiar refrain, “this time is different.”

The cryptocurrency and ICO markets have grown rapidly. These markets are local, national and international and include an ever-broadening range of products and participants. They also present investors and other market participants with many questions, some new and some old (but in a new form), including, to list just a few:

Is the product legal? Is it subject to regulation, including rules designed to protect investors? Does the product comply with those rules?

Is the offering legal? Are those offering the product licensed to do so?

Are the trading markets fair? Can prices on those markets be manipulated? Can I sell when I want to?

Are there substantial risks of theft or loss, including from hacking?

The answers to these and other important questions often require an in-depth analysis, and the answers will differ depending on many factors. This statement provides my general views on the cryptocurrency and ICO markets[1] and is directed principally to two groups:

“Main Street” investors, and

Market professionals – including, for example, broker-dealers, investment advisers, exchanges, lawyers and accountants – whose actions impact Main Street investors.

Considerations for Main Street Investors

A number of concerns have been raised regarding the cryptocurrency and ICO markets, including that, as they are currently operating, there is substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.

Investors should understand that to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies.[2] If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary.

We have issued investor alerts, bulletins and statements on initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency-related investments, including with respect to the marketing of certain offerings and investments by celebrities and others.[3] Please take a moment to read them. If you choose to invest in these products, please ask questions and demand clear answers. A list of sample questions that may be helpful is attached.

As with any other type of potential investment, if a promoter guarantees returns, if an opportunity sounds too good to be true, or if you are pressured to act quickly, please exercise extreme caution and be aware of the risk that your investment may be lost.

Please also recognize that these markets span national borders and that significant trading may occur on systems and platforms outside the United States. Your invested funds may quickly travel overseas without your knowledge. As a result, risks can be amplified, including the risk that market regulators, such as the SEC, may not be able to effectively pursue bad actors or recover funds.

To learn more about these markets and their regulation, please read the “Additional Discussion of Cryptocurrencies, ICOs and Securities Regulation” section below.

Considerations for Market Professionals

I believe that initial coin offerings – whether they represent offerings of securities or not – can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects. However, any such activity that involves an offering of securities must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other investor protections that our securities laws require. A change in the structure of a securities offering does not change the fundamental point that when a security is being offered, our securities laws must be followed.[4] Said another way, replacing a traditional corporate interest recorded in a central ledger with an enterprise interest recorded through a blockchain entry on a distributed ledger may change the form of the transaction, but it does not change the substance.

I urge market professionals, including securities lawyers, accountants and consultants, to read closely the investigative report we released earlier this year (the “21(a) Report”)[5] and review our subsequent enforcement actions.[6] In the 21(a) Report, the Commission applied longstanding securities law principles to demonstrate that a particular token constituted an investment contract and therefore was a security under our federal securities laws. Specifically, we concluded that the token offering represented an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.

Following the issuance of the 21(a) Report, certain market professionals have attempted to highlight utility characteristics of their proposed initial coin offerings in an effort to claim that their proposed tokens or coins are not securities. Many of these assertions appear to elevate form over substance. Merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security. Tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasize the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others continue to contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law. On this and other points where the application of expertise and judgment is expected, I believe that gatekeepers and others, including securities lawyers, accountants and consultants, need to focus on their responsibilities. I urge you to be guided by the principal motivation for our registration, offering process and disclosure requirements: investor protection and, in particular, the protection of our Main Street investors.

I also caution market participants against promoting or touting the offer and sale of coins without first determining whether the securities laws apply to those actions. Selling securities generally requires a license, and experience shows that excessive touting in thinly traded and volatile markets can be an indicator of “scalping,” “pump and dump” and other manipulations and frauds. Similarly, I also caution those who operate systems and platforms that effect or facilitate transactions in these products that they may be operating unregistered exchanges or broker-dealers that are in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

On cryptocurrencies, I want to emphasize two points. First, while there are cryptocurrencies that do not appear to be securities, simply calling something a “currency” or a currency-based product does not mean that it is not a security. Before launching a cryptocurrency or a product with its value tied to one or more cryptocurrencies, its promoters must either (1) be able to demonstrate that the currency or product is not a security or (2) comply with applicable registration and other requirements under our securities laws. Second, brokers, dealers and other market participants that allow for payments in cryptocurrencies, allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies on margin, or otherwise use cryptocurrencies to facilitate securities transactions should exercise particular caution, including ensuring that their cryptocurrency activities are not undermining their anti-money laundering and know-your-customer obligations.[7] As I have stated previously, these market participants should treat payments and other transactions made in cryptocurrency as if cash were being handed from one party to the other.

Additional Discussion of Cryptocurrencies, ICOs and Securities Regulation

Cryptocurrencies. Speaking broadly, cryptocurrencies purport to be items of inherent value (similar, for instance, to cash or gold) that are designed to enable purchases, sales and other financial transactions. They are intended to provide many of the same functions as long-established currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro or Japanese yen but do not have the backing of a government or other body. Although the design and maintenance of cryptocurrencies differ, proponents of cryptocurrencies highlight various potential benefits and features of them, including (1) the ability to make transfers without an intermediary and without geographic limitation, (2) finality of settlement, (3) lower transaction costs compared to other forms of payment and (4) the ability to publicly verify transactions. Other often-touted features of cryptocurrencies include personal anonymity and the absence of government regulation or oversight. Critics of cryptocurrencies note that these features may facilitate illicit trading and financial transactions, and that some of the purported beneficial features may not prove to be available in practice.

It has been asserted that cryptocurrencies are not securities and that the offer and sale of cryptocurrencies are beyond the SEC’s jurisdiction. Whether that assertion proves correct with respect to any digital asset that is labeled as a cryptocurrency will depend on the characteristics and use of that particular asset. In any event, it is clear that, just as the SEC has a sharp focus on how U.S. dollar, euro and Japanese yen transactions affect our securities markets, we have the same interests and responsibilities with respect to cryptocurrencies. This extends, for example, to securities firms and other market participants that allow payments to be made in cryptocurrencies, set up structures to invest in or hold cryptocurrencies, or extend credit to customers to purchase or hold cryptocurrencies.

Initial Coin Offerings. Coinciding with the substantial growth in cryptocurrencies, companies and individuals increasingly have been using initial coin offerings to raise capital for their businesses and projects. Typically these offerings involve the opportunity for individual investors to exchange currency such as U.S. dollars or cryptocurrencies in return for a digital asset labeled as a coin or token.

These offerings can take many different forms, and the rights and interests a coin is purported to provide the holder can vary widely. A key question for all ICO market participants: “Is the coin or token a security?” As securities law practitioners know well, the answer depends on the facts. For example, a token that represents a participation interest in a book-of-the-month club may not implicate our securities laws, and may well be an efficient way for the club’s operators to fund the future acquisition of books and facilitate the distribution of those books to token holders. In contrast, many token offerings appear to have gone beyond this construct and are more analogous to interests in a yet-to-be-built publishing house with the authors, books and distribution networks all to come. It is especially troubling when the promoters of these offerings emphasize the secondary market trading potential of these tokens. Prospective purchasers are being sold on the potential for tokens to increase in value – with the ability to lock in those increases by reselling the tokens on a secondary market – or to otherwise profit from the tokens based on the efforts of others. These are key hallmarks of a security and a securities offering.

By and large, the structures of initial coin offerings that I have seen promoted involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements and other investor protection provisions of our federal securities laws. Generally speaking, these laws provide that investors deserve to know what they are investing in and the relevant risks involved.

I have asked the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to continue to police this area vigorously and recommend enforcement actions against those that conduct initial coin offerings in violation of the federal securities laws.

Conclusion

We at the SEC are committed to promoting capital formation. The technology on which cryptocurrencies and ICOs are based may prove to be disruptive, transformative and efficiency enhancing. I am confident that developments in fintech will help facilitate capital formation and provide promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike.

I encourage Main Street investors to be open to these opportunities, but to ask good questions, demand clear answers and apply good common sense when doing so. When advising clients, designing products and engaging in transactions, market participants and their advisers should thoughtfully consider our laws, regulations and guidance, as well as our principles-based securities law framework, which has served us well in the face of new developments for more than 80 years. I also encourage market participants and their advisers to engage with the SEC staff to aid in their analysis under the securities laws. Staff providing assistance on these matters remain available at FinTech@sec.gov.

Sample Questions for Investors Considering a Cryptocurrency or ICO

Investment Opportunity [8]

Who exactly am I contracting with? Who is issuing and sponsoring the product, what are their backgrounds, and have they provided a full and complete description of the product? Do they have a clear written business plan that I understand? Who is promoting or marketing the product, what are their backgrounds, and are they licensed to sell the product? Have they been paid to promote the product? Where is the enterprise located?

Where is my money going and what will it be used for? Is my money going to be used to “cash out” others?

What specific rights come with my investment?

Are there financial statements? If so, are they audited, and by whom?

Is there trading data? If so, is there some way to verify it?

How, when, and at what cost can I sell my investment? For example, do I have a right to give the token or coin back to the company or to receive a refund? Can I resell the coin or token, and if so, are there any limitations on my ability to resell?

If a digital wallet is involved, what happens if I lose the key? Will I still have access to my investment?

If a blockchain is used, is the blockchain open and public? Has the code been published, and has there been an independent cybersecurity audit?

Has the offering been structured to comply with the securities laws and, if not, what implications will that have for the stability of the enterprise and the value of my investment?

What legal protections may or may not be available in the event of fraud, a hack, malware, or a downturn in business prospects? Who will be responsible for refunding my investment if something goes wrong?

If I do have legal rights, can I effectively enforce them and will there be adequate funds to compensate me if my rights are violated?"

The majority of crypto markets appear to have regained correlation with bitcoin, with BCH, ETH, LTC, DASH and many other major markets dumping in unison with BTC. For bitcoin, today’s retrace down to test the $11,000 USD line comprises the sixth consecutive day that BTC has lost value after testing the $20,000 area, whereas BCH is experiencing its second days of retracement following its dramatic establishment of new record highs at the $4,000 area.

Bitcoin Loses +40% in 1 Week

Bitcoin has continued to dump in recent days, with the BTC markets having now experienced its sixth consecutive day of retracement following the establishment of new all-time highs just below the $20,000 area on multiple major exchanges.

As of this writing, the BTC markets are trading above $12,200 after having found structural support at the $11,200 area – comprising a full retrace of the bull run that started from the 10th of December. Bitfinex experienced loss of approximately 40% percent – dropping from a high of $19,891 on the 17th of December to test a local floor of $11,000 today. Bitstamp’s price dropped by approx. 40%, falling from $19666 to a low of $11,160.

Looking at the weekly chart, the bearish week has comprised a test of the 61.8 Fibonacci retracement area when measuring from July’s $1,800 breakout area. The recent slump has also dragged the weekly stochastic RSI below the 80 thresholds for the first time since early November.

Bitcoin Cash Retraces by 61% in Two Days

BCH has also experienced a significant loss in value, pulling back by approximately 61% in two days before bouncing off the $1570 area when paired against the U.S. dollar on Bitfinex. The considerable retracement has followed BCH’s recent dramatic spike that established a new all-time high of approximately $4,110 – after the market gained approximately 130% in just three days. BCH is currently trading for roughly $2000.

Altcoin Markets Regain Correlation With Bitcoin

Following this recent price action in which scores of altcoins set new all-time highs against the dollar, many major altcoin markets have seen retracements of a comparable percentage to that experienced by bitcoin in recent days.

Litecoin established a new high of almost $370 on December 19, before retracing by approximately 45% over the course of following days, to establish a local floor of roughly $200 this morning. LTC is currently trading for approximately $210.

After setting a new record high of approximately $860 on the 17th of December, Ethereum has since pulled back, with bearish momentum accelerating to reach an approximately 30% retrace from the all-time high to test and break the $600 area. ETH is currently trading for approximately $570.

Dash established a record high of $1600 on the 20th of December, and has since witnessed losses of approximately 40% – culminating in a test of $930 area. Dash has since bounced, with prices hovering at approximately $1100 for a while, then dropping again.

Ripple have continued to gain against bitcoin – with XRP establishing a new all-time high of roughly $1.35 after gaining by more than 100% in the last 2 days. Ripple was first consolidating just below the $1.00 USD at $0.96 after experiencing a 40% retracement down to the $0.80 area earlier this morning, later dropping back below $0.80.

Look away now if you own bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. This won’t be breaking news to you if you are invested, but today has seen the entire crypto market fall by double-digit percentages.

The price of bitcoin slumped by 15 percent to drop below $12,000 for the first time since December 4. Ethereum, meanwhile, fell by over 20 percent to hover above $1,000 and Ripple is down 33 percent to $1.23 at the time of writing.

The price drop is having a huge impact. According to Coinmarketcap.com, a site that is quickly becoming the go-to price checker, just one of the top 100 highest valued cryptocurrencies isn’t in the red over the past 24 hours. That’s Tether.

It’s a far cry from when bitcoin hit a record of close to $20,000 exactly a month ago on December 16.

Despite the drop, Ethereum, Ripple and the rest of the alt coins have largely fared worse than bitcoin.

The top 10 based on coin market caps…

Numbers 11-20…

Finally, a little green ink at number 25…

Like all things crypto price related, it isn’t clear what is driving the changes.

A Bloomberg report yesterday suggested that China is preparing to block domestic internet users accessing international bitcoin exchanges. The country banned Chinese exchanges and ICOs last year.

Last week, it emerged that the central government is working to drive out China’s bitcoin miners, who are thought to account for the majority on the planet. Many of the bigger names are already expanding overseas in preparation but the news jolted the market.

There’s also been plenty of speculation around Korea’s plans to regulate crypto, although the government has since clarified it doesn’t plan an all-out ban on bitcoin and crypto trading.

Crypto being crypto, there are some alternative theories, too.

https://twitter.com/CryptoKong/status/953206927365898240

We’ve been here before, of course — the headline to this story may seem familiar….

The crypto market suffered huge loses right before Christmas last month although most valuations had recovered since, such is the volatile nature of the space. That could yet happen following today’s slump. Indeed, some financial market watchers predicted prices could jump this week as Wall Street bankers collect their bonuses.

Blockchain Democratizes Fine Art Investment

If you fancy yourself a ""serious"" collector of blue-chip art, perhaps you are thinking the blockchain is only about $11.00 digital drawings and cartoon cats and punks. Think again.

In 2018, the company Maecenas will be launching the first open blockchain platform that democratizes access to fine art. Now people who have always dreamed of owning famous paintings can buy shares in a Picasso, Warhol, Monet, etc. On the flipside, galleries, museums, and collectors can offer up works from their collection for bid on Maecenas to raise money for the purchase of future works (while leaving their collection intact). This may sound like a regular art fund, but remember that blockchain cuts out the middleman, greatly reducing the transaction costs. The transaction cost with blockchain is so low that Maecenas can theoretically let you invest as little as fractions of a penny using cryptocurrency without taking the hit of transaction fees. Maecenas shares the use case below on their website. It does a nice job of illustrating the savings that occur with using blockchain versus traditional transactions.

""A Gallery wants to acquire a $3M piece to expand its Warhol collection. Instead of getting a three-year art-secured loan at 13.5% annual interest, it can raise funds from Maecenus investors by listing some of their artwork at a 6% one-off fee. This represents a saving of over $400k in fees for the gallery.""

Great for the gallery, but what about the investors? The investors also benefit from the magic of blockchain. Because fees and the cost of transactions goes dramatically down with blockchain, and cryptocurrency can be infinitely divided, Maecenus can transform artworks valued at tens of millions of dollars into tiny digital units that can be easily bought and sold in real time: essentially a stock market for art, but with far less friction or fees.

I am a huge fan of the model because it capitalizes on so many aspects of what makes blockchain so powerful opens up fine-art investing to everyone. My friends and family should expect fractional shares in blue chip art for many birthdays and Christmases to come.

Blockchain Reduces Art Forgery with Improved Authentication, Verification, and Provenance

Perhaps the most obvious use of blockchain (and closest to my heart) is to fight art forgery through the establishment of better authentication and provenance. Since at its core the blockchain is a distributed ledger, it can provide an unalterable record of provenance starting with authentication and ending with the current owner of an artwork.

Verisart certifies and verifies artworks and collectibles using the Bitcoin blockchain. They are fighting art forgery by providing an ""airtight"" authentication methodology that allows for real time verification of artworks using distributed ledger and image-recognition technology. Their initial target market is authentication for living, working artists. In the long run, they plan on moving toward authenticating older works by working with artists' estates eventually having the provenance for every artwork in their blockchain. (Shameless self-promotion here: If they are in need of a large database of data from catalogue raisonné, I may know someone who can help them out…)

Beyond fighting forgery and theft, blockchain has the potential to protect and support artists by introducing new methods of monetizing their work. Artlery is building the world's ""first currency ever to be explicitly backed by the creation, exhibition, and appreciation of art,"" which they call CLIO, named after the muse of history. The CLIO is designed to support the creators of art, and artists can secure a spot in the initial offering by uploading their portfolios here: artlery.com/artists

How do I Get Involved with the Blockchain Art Market?

My recommendation would be to start simple. Get your feet wet with something as silly as a CryptoKitty, or better yet, support my new friends at DADA.nyc and buy some affordable, unique digital art - I promise you their gratitude will make you feel good about it and you’ll want to buy more. Once you have your MetaMask and Coinbase accounts set up and have your head around how the transactions work, you will be ready to invest in microshares of a Monet or a Picasso when Maecenas goes live in 2018.

For artists, I'd strongly recommend looking into a service like Verisart or Ascribe to protect and monetize your work. I’ve spent the last three years building an analytical art database of known works for our most important artists because I find the current vulnerability of our artistic record to fakes and forgeries deeply depressing. If current artists leverage blockchain technology to authenticate and track their works, we will have a clean, unalterable record of their artworks and can avoid posthumously piecing together a record of their work in a catalogue raisonné. For this reason alone, blockchain may be the most important technology to ever hit the art market.

Update: Many have asked how to tokenize their own art and launch a blockchain art marketplace. We have outlined this in a new article titled Blockchain 3.0 - How to Launch Your Own Blockchain Art Market.

Blockchain and smart contracts are allowing users to trade without escrow services or centralized institutions. And this new technology is allowing for a marketplace that the world has never seen before.

This marketplace will allow anybody to rent or use a piece of Sophia’s mind. In fact, all of the algorithms and pieces that created Sophia will be up for use via SingularityNET, as well as any other AI. It will be the first and largest AI marketplace, where anyone can buy or sell artificial intelligence.

AGI will be the token used in SingularityNET’s marketplace — there will only be 1 billion tokens ever in circulation, with the public ICO entry price at $0.10 per token.

Now Trading on Exchanges

About a week ago, the token was released on a few small exchanges, including Kucoin for the highest volume and Tidex with the second highest. When first released, the token peaked ar around $2.30 and is now averaging around $.74.

It’s a bit more complicated to understand what the market cap is just yet, as only half of the tokens were released in the public sale. The tokens that are currently in circulation are just of the public token sale, which can give an estimated value of anywhere between $30-75 million market cap.

But these numbers dwarf CEO Ben Goertzel’s estimates of what a decentralized AI marketplace can tap into. Currently, the AI marketplace is about a $122 billion market. By 2025, researchers estimate that this can become a $3.05 trillion market.

Ben believes that the largest obstacle holding back AI innovation is lack of cooperation. Many great scientists are producing AI results but with no way to communicate these to each other. SingulairtyNET can become the center connection for humans and humanoids alike to trade artificial intelligence.

How does SingularityNet work? Watch this short video (2:00)

“SingularityNET is the first and only platform that allows AIs to cooperate and coordinate at scale. This removes one of the major limiting factors to AI growth today — the lack of interoperability — which severely restricts the ability to leverage the strengths and capabilities of individual AIs. No longer must AIs exist in silos, only capable of operating within a specific company, infrastructure, or industry.” -Ben Goertzel

There is an Alpha currently running on MetaMask’s Kovan testnet (AGI is an ERC20 token) of what the marketplace could look like. Check out our article about dApps, otherwise known as decentralized applications, to find out more about how to run testnets.

The AGI token is a utility token that will make the marketplace seamless and organized. With so many different services on the market board, having the thousands of transactions go through one blockchain ledger will make all transactions transparent. Since there is no other use for the AGI token other than for the marketplace, all the transactions will be SingularityNET related.

SingularityNET has recently partnered with Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange that will help people monetize their data. Other investors include NR Capital and SGInnovate. Many investors flocked to AGI’s ICO as the $36,000,000 cap was reached in 66 seconds. The whitelist demand was at $360+ million."
2018-01-16 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin and Ethereum tumble after renewed fears of regulatory crackdown	['Samuel Gibbs']	"The price of bitcoin was sent plummeting 18% as it and other cryptocurrencies yo-yo in value over fears of a wider trading crackdown spurred by renewed potential of South Korean regulatory action.



Bitcoin’s slide of over over $2,200 triggered a massive selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23% on the day, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next biggest, Ripple, plunging 33%.

Following initial statements that South Korea was looking to ban trading of cryptocurrencies, followed by a climbdown, the country’s finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in an interview with local radio station TBS that banning trading in digital currencies was “a live option”.

Kim said: “There are no disagreements over regulating speculation,” such as using real-name accounts and levying taxes on cryptocurrency trading. Shutting down digital currency exchanges is “a live option but government ministries need to very seriously review it,” he added.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Bitcoin is a 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Invented in 2008, you store your bitcoins in a digital wallet, and transactions are stored in a public ledger known as the bitcoin blockchain, which prevents the digital currency being double-spent. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, with some deeming it a risky investment. In January 2021 the UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned consumers they should be prepared to lose all their money if they invest in schemes promising high returns from digital currencies such as bitcoin. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. In November 2021 it hit a record high of more than $68,000, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis. Bitcoin has been criticised for the vast energy reserves and associated carbon footprint of the system. New bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, which is done by using computers to carry out complex calculations. The more bitcoins that have been ""mined"", the longer it takes to mine new coin, and the more electricity is used in the process. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Following the latest news, Bitcoin traded as low as $11,191.59 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, down 18% on the day for a short period, putting the digital currency on track for its biggest one-day fall in three years.

“It’s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting the cryptocurrency, with news around South Korea’s further crackdown on trading the driver today,” said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as “substantial” amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. “But we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible.”

Joachim Wuermeling, a director of Germany’s national bank, said on Monday that national rules are likely to prove ineffective given the borderless bitcoin’s global scale. He said: “Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited.”

European Union states and legislators agreed last month on stricter rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing on exchange platforms for bitcoin and other virtual currencies.

Meanwhile, Chinese regulators have banned initial coin offerings (ICOs), shut down local cryptocurrency trading exchanges and limited bitcoin mining. Chinese authorities also plan to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralised trading, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year, with bitcoin hitting a high of about $20,000 in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and an explosion in ICOs drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum.

The latest tumble left bitcoin down more than 40% from the record high in mid-December, wiping about $130bn billion off its “market cap” – the unit price multiplied by the total number of bitcoins that have been released into the market.

“[It] seems like it’s uncertainty spooking the markets … with regulations unclear,” said Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare. “[Traders] are taking profits on the increased risk scenarios going forward.”

The price of bitcoin was fluctuating to under $12,000 by publication time, according to Bitstamp.

2017’s 1,500% rise in the value of bitcoin has made billionaires out of early investors such as the Winklevoss twins, and seen some such as the Pineapple Fund turn to philanthropic endeavours.



But high-profile investor Warren Buffett recently said he would never invest in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, predicting that the assets are in for a fall.

Many do not share Buffett’s scepticism. Companies such as Kodak have been rocketing in value by launching new cryptocurrencies, and some simply by putting the word blockchain in their name."
2018-01-09 00:00:00+00:00	4 Cryptocurrencies That Could Surpass Bitcoin	['Sean Williams']	"Historically, the stock market has been the greatest creator of long-term wealth, with an average annual gain, inclusive of dividend investment and adjusted for inflation, of 7%. This would imply the opportunity for invested funds to double in value about once every decade.

However, cryptocurrency investors have laughed their way to the bank over the past year, with virtual currency valuations going through the roof. When 2017 began, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies combined was just $17.7 billion. By Jan. 4, 2018 (369 days later), the combined market cap of all 1,384 investable cryptocurrencies had soared to $774 billion. That's an increase in value of close to 4,300%, and it's a return the broad-based stock indexes would take decades to deliver.

Objects in the rearview mirror are getting closer

Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, and the digital coin accepted by more merchants than any other virtual currency, is often credited with being the impetus for this rally. After all, bitcoin was the first to bring blockchain technology -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underlies cryptocurrencies -- into the mainstream, and was the first actively traded digital currency on decentralized exchanges.

But, truth be told, the rally in recent months has been about far more than just bitcoin. In fact, bitcoin's dominance in relation to the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap is about as low as it's ever been at 34%, suggesting that the valuations of other virtual coins are growing at a much quicker pace than bitcoin's. In fact, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies, excluding bitcoin, has jumped from $2.24 billion on Dec. 31, 2016 to $522 billion as of Jan. 4, 2018, according to CoinMarketCap.com. That's a better than 23,200% increase in just over a year's time.

The search for the next bitcoin has investors and speculators pushing a number of digital currencies higher. However, only four, in my opinion, currently have the ""tools"" needed to surpass bitcoin's market cap in the intermediate term.

The two likeliest candidates to surpass bitcoin

Two of the likeliest cryptocurrencies to surpass bitcoin's market cap are Ethereum and/or Ripple, which just so happen to be third and second, respectively, in cryptocurrency market cap at the moment.

Ethereum

What makes Ethereum so special is its blockchain, and the number of organizations currently testing out that blockchain technology in some capacity. Ethereum's digital ledger incorporates protocols known as ""smart contracts,"" which help to verify, facilitate, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. Smart contracts are particularly attractive from an efficacy and legal standpoint for businesses, which is why the Ethereum Foundation has had little issue finding takers to test out its technology. Ethereum's blockchain also moves beyond bitcoin's currency-only applications, which is why so many different industries are interested in what Ethereum has to offer.

In February, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was formed, and by Oct. 18, 2017, exactly 200 organizations from a variety of industries were testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in small-scale and pilot projects. This includes a number of brand-name companies, as well as governments. If we begin to see wider acceptance of the Ethereum blockchain in real-world applications (i.e., beyond pilot projects), there's a real chance it could surpass bitcoin's market cap.

Ripple

Ripple might even be a bigger threat to bitcoin, with the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin needing only to double once more in order to surpass it.

Like Ethereum, all eyes are on Ripple's blockchain technology, which is being specifically targeted at big banks and financial institutions. Ripple's exceptionally low transactions fees and quick settlement times are designed to be a major upgrade over the long-winded verification process payments go through with the traditional banking system.

Though Ripple announced in June 2016 that seven large banks would be testing out its blockchain technology in a limited capacity, it really gained notoriety in November 2017 when American Express (AXP -1.13%) and Banco Santander (SAN -2.46%) announced their intention to use Ripple's blockchain in a real-world test. The partnership will allow U.S.-based American Express users who send non-card payments to U.K. Santander accounts to have those payments processed through Ripple's blockchain. It's believed that these transactions will settle instantly, which is far quicker than what happens with current cross-border transactions, where the verification process can take days.

Ripple has also benefited from rumors surrounding its presumably inevitable listing on Coinbase, the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchange. Assuming it does get listed soon and manages to snag new banking partners, it could give bitcoin a real run for its money.

Two dark-horse candidates that could really surprise and surpass bitcoin

There are also two dark-horse candidates that could do exactly what Ripple has done and emerge from the shadows to make a run at bitcoin.

Stellar

As with Ripple and Ethereum, Stellar's blockchain technology is the star. Stellar's blockchain offers quick processing times on its network of between two and five seconds for most transactions, which again would be a major improvement over the extended verification times often seen in cross-border payments.

Stellar's blockchain also incorporates its own version of smart contracts. Again, Stellar is making it clear that its blockchain is designed for enterprise customers and targeted at cross-border scalable applications.

But unlike Ripple and its laser focus on big banks, Stellar is approaching its search for scalability by seeking out multinational businesses. In October, IBM (IBM -0.17%) and KlickEx partnered with Stellar to facilitate cheaper and quicker cross-border transactions in the South Pacific region. This partnership involves a dozen international banks, representing multiple different currencies, developing and deploying Stellar's blockchain. The idea here being that IBM, which generates tens of billions of dollars each year outside the U.S., can receive payments from customers and have those payment process almost instantly, instead of waiting days for them to settle.

Assuming this project proves fruitful for IBM, ""Big Blue"" could choose to expand its application to other parts of the world. This is Stellar's chance to shine, and if it does, it may have a shot at garnering new partnerships and toppling bitcoin in the process.

Monero

Though it's the smallest of the four at the moment, with a market cap that's almost $250 billion behind that of bitcoin, Monero has the potential to really turn heads and supplant bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency.

Why Monero, you ask? Look no further than the tremendous surge in interest for privacy coins of late. A privacy coin is nothing more than a virtual currency that's placed an increased emphasis on the privacy and anonymity of the sender and receivers of virtual funds.

Many cryptocurrency users falsely believe that because their logged data is stored in an encrypted fashion on a digital ledger that it can't be traced back to them -- but this just isn't true. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service recently won a legal battle against Coinbase that required the cryptocurrency exchange to turn over information on 14,355 users who'd exchanged more than $20,000 worth of bitcoin between 2013 and 2015. Though the IRS's legal win was for the purpose of catching capital-gain tax evaders, the broader theme here is that blockchain transactions often aren't as anonymous as you'd think.

Monero employs an open-sourced protocol known as CryptoNote that uses ring signatures to obscure the sender of a payment. Ring signatures are akin to having multiple signers on a joint bank account, but without knowing who the official signer is. Each transaction on Monero's blockchain generates a one-time spend key known as a stealth address that allows only the recipient to detect and spend those funds.

If privacy coins remain popular among cryptocurrency investors, and Monero lands a major partner, it could come out of nowhere to leapfrog bitcoin."

Accordingly, firms trading these products must understand how the futures and swaps markets are regulated – this is particularly true for firms with little or no experience operating in the highly-regulated derivatives markets.

Implications for Bitcoin Market Participants

Bitcoin futures and swaps are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC""). Although bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are a novel class of commodities, derivatives based on these products are regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act and rules of the CFTC and National Futures Association (""NFA"") just like all other derivative contracts. This has numerous immediate and practical implications for market participants: • Futures commission merchants – Any entity that solicits or accepts orders to buy or sell bitcoin futures or swaps and accepts money or assets from customers for such orders must register with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant. • Introducing brokers – Any entity that solicits or accepts orders for bitcoin futures or swaps but does not accept customer funds must register as an introducing broker. • Commodity trading advisors – Any entity that, for compensation or profit, advises others, directly or indirectly, as to the value of or the advisability of trading bitcoin futures or swaps must register as a commodity trading advisor. • Commodity pool operators – Any fund or collective investment vehicle that trades bitcoin futures or swaps is a commodity pool, the operator of which must register as a commodity pool operator. • Swap dealers – Any entity that holds itself out as a dealer in bitcoin swaps; makes a market in bitcoin swaps; regularly enters into bitcoin swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own account; or engages in more than a de minimis volume of bitcoin swaps as a dealer must register as a swap dealer. Exemptions from some or all of the regulatory requirements associated with each of these registration categories may be available depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each individual or firm.

Devil in the Details: Reference Price Calculations

Each bitcoin derivative contract attempts to accurately represent prices in the physical bitcoin market through the methodology defined in the contract specifications for calculating the reference price for its bitcoin contract. This calculation is the core commercial term of the contract because it determines whether the derivative will function as an effective and reliable proxy for a position in the physical market. However, this calculation also provides would-be market manipulators with instructions on how the reference price the futures and swaps contracts will be determined and, in theory, how those prices could be manipulated for their individual gain. Market participants should use particular care when trading in both bitcoin futures or swaps and related markets because this type of trading activity may give rise to heightened regulatory scrutiny.



CME uses the Bitcoin Reference Rate (""BRR""), calculated by CME together with Crypto Facilities Ltd. using aggregated trade flow from major bitcoin spot exchanges (Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit, and Kraken) during a 1-hour daily calculation window. CBOE uses the auction price for bitcoin on Gemini Exchange (another spot bitcoin exchange) as of the futures contract’s final settlement date. Cantor will determine its own reference price based on various factors, including publicly available bitcoin spot price sources, market analytics such as bitcoin price arbitrage matrices, and the Exchange’s own bids, offers, and traded prices.

Key Features of the Bitcoin Derivative Contracts

Why the massive drop in cryptocurrency prices? Well, there have been massive stories that the Chinese government will be banning Bitcoin mining in the country, and with 80% of Bitcoin mined in China, this is huge on its own. But then news broke a couple of hours ago from Reuters that the South Korean government was pushing laws in to ban cryptocurrency trading on SK exchanges.

This has seen the drop of virtually every single cryptocurrency, with Ethereum going from its record high of $1400+ to $1230 in a matter of hours.

Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency flagship entered 2018 at a relatively quiet pace, but started to pick up around the end of this week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up 14.55% for the week.

Ethereum: Although losing its #2 market cap spot to Ripple’s explosive run, Ethereum broke through the $1,000 price barrier to near $1,075 with a gain of 31.82% for the week.

Ripple Now the Second Most Valuable Currency: This has been a wild and exciting ride for Ripple investors this week. The currency reached an ATH of $3.81, a 1424% increase from 30 days prior. The dramatic increase comes as a global interest in cryptocurrency continues to grow and given ripples practical usage (with big-name financial partnerships) for cross-border payments.

Altcoins Help Crypto Market Cap Reach ATH of $700 Billion: December may not have been the best month for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, however “the pre-Christmas sell-off seems to be well behind us now”, states eToro Analyst Mati Greenspan. According to CoinMarketCap on January 4th at the time of writing, the total market capitalization was nearly $762 Billion.

Tron Enters the Top Ten Arena: In the past 7 days alone, the official currency of Tron (TRX) grew nearly 444% to reach around $.28. Tron is currently in the 6th position in market cap size. Tron has made recent headlines for its astonishing growth, as well as big-name partnerships and starstudded business team.

Stellar Soars to New Heights: The tech behind Stellar (formerly known as Stellar Lumens) is nearly identical to Ripple, making a strong case for many investors to view the Stellar project as a credible coin with a bright future. When John McCaleb left Ripple to start Stellar, one can assume that not even McCaleb could predict that Stellar would reach ATH’s of $0.91 so quickly. The valuation marks a close to 10 fold increase from its $.09 cent valuation seen in early December. Stellar grew 127% for the week.

Peter Thiel’s Silicon Valley Venture Capital Firm Places Big Bet on Bitcoin: In mid-2017, the Founder’s Fund spent between $15 Million to $20 Million on Bitcoin. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was around $2,500. Thiel deems Bitcoin the gold of cryptocurrency, speculating that it is highly undervalued at its current value.

Crypto’s New Billionaire Mile: Watch out Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Jeff Bezos, there’s a fresh set of Billionaires in town. On Monday, January 1st, 2018, with a market cap of $88,900,000,000, the CEO’s/founders of Ripple were worth as follows: Chris Larsen ($37.3 billion), Brad Garlinghouse ($9.5 billion), and Jed McCaleb (5.3 billion XRP). However, considering crypto’s volatile nature, there’s no guarantee they will remain in this category long-term.

Criminals & Crypto: While Bitcoin became notorious for its facilitation of transactions in the black market, a recent trend towards using more private coins, such as Monero, has alarmed officials. According to the Europol, the European Union Agency for Law enforcement, Monero along with “Ethereum and Zcash are gaining popularity within the digital underground.” While these coins are seemingly untrackable, companies like Chainalysis are enhancing measures to combat these criminals which include crimes such as money laundering and extortion.

BitConnect Slapped with Cease and Desist: The infamous bitcoin lending platform BitConnect is in hot water after the Texas Securities Commissioner issued an Emergency Cease and Desist Order. The controversial platform has a 4.1 billion USD market cap and is shrouded in mystery.

Cryptocurrency News from Around the World

Japanese Finance Mammoth Claims Bitcoin Increases GDP by 0.3%: According to two analysts at Nomura, “the scale of this increase in assets can hardly be ignored.” With the “wealth effect”, cryptocurrency investors who feel richer are taking their new fortunes and turning them into “real world” spending. Currently, approximately 3.7 million worth of bitcoins is held by 1 million Japanese citizens.

Egypt’s Grand Mufti Claims Bitcoin is “Un-Islamic”: After consulting with various economic experts, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam stated that cryptocurrency in itself goes against the Islamic faith. Comparing cryptocurrency to gambling (which is forbidden in Islam), the Grand Mufti stated that virtual currency goes hand-in-hand with “direct responsibility in financial ruin for individuals.” Similarly, in November of 2017, the head religious authority in Turkey remarked congruent statements, citing digital currencies to be criminal in nature and therefore against Islam.

President Reagan’s Prior Office of Management Director Thinks We are All “Stupid Speculators”: David Stockman is clearly no fan of cryptocurrency. In fact, in an interview with CNBC show “Futures Now”, Stockman stated “It’s basically a class of really stupid speculators who have convinced themselves that trees grow to the sky. It will burn out in a spectacular crash.” It should be noted that Stockman often has a bearish outlook in the financial world.

While Bitcoin Surges, the USD Declines: With a 10% loss, the US dollar experienced its biggest annual decrease compared to other major currencies since 2003. While fiat currencies such as the euro and pound strengthened against the dollar, none were quite as powerful as digital currencies, including Bitcoins 1,341 percent increase in value from the beginning to end of 2017."
2018-01-26 19:27:59+00:00	Bitcoin’s Largest Price Changes Coincide With Major News Events...	['Max Gulker', 'Get Notified Of New Articles Max Gulker']	"This article is based on the excellent research of Alexandra Emily, Benjamin Loeper, and Edward Koharik, under the supervision of their professor Dr. Ana Ichim and AIER staff.

The volatility of the Bitcoin/dollar exchange rate is frequently discussed in the media and often cited as the primary reason why Bitcoin does not currently function as a reliable store of value and medium of exchange, generally accepted requirements for something to count as a money. AIER collaborated with undergraduate students from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, through a fall-semester course followed by an intensive two-week program at AIER, to investigate various aspects of Bitcoin’s volatility and the determinants of its price. In the coming weeks, we will publish multiple articles summarizing our findings. The first article in this series focuses on work done by a group of students during the fall semester on the causes of Bitcoin’s largest daily changes in price.

If Bitcoin trades in an efficient market with enough buyers and sellers, theory holds, its price should reflect all publicly available information about it, and changes in price should reflect new information. However, Bitcoin might not yet meet this standard. First, if the number of market participants is relatively small, the idiosyncratic behavior of a few individuals may significantly impact the price. Second, there have been accusations of market manipulation by traders of Bitcoin. Third, many observers believe Bitcoin to be in a speculative bubble, which may or may not imply large price changes not driven by newly revealed information.

While the scope of the study does not extend to all daily changes in Bitcoin’s price, we focused on the largest daily changes in price from the beginning of 2016 through the end of November 2017. We found evidence largely consistent with Bitcoin’s largest price changes occurring on dates when significant or widely discussed new information about the cryptocurrency was revealed. This does not mean we consider the market for Bitcoin to be efficient; we do not directly study the size of these price changes, nor can we establish certain causality between the events and price changes in question. However, the fact that one can point to specific events coinciding with the largest changes in price suggests at least some degree of rationality in the market.

The table below summarizes the seven largest daily price changes of Bitcoin in terms of absolute value during the period in question. Each coincides with a new event or piece of information that investors may have found important.

The largest daily increase in Bitcoin’s price during the period occurred on July 20, 2017 (25.4 percent), when an agreement appeared to be reached regarding the scaling of Bitcoin’s blockchain-based payment system. The largest daily price decrease occurred on September 14, 2017, when the Chinese government announced plans to shut down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.

We also examined the 50 largest price changes in absolute value during the period, summarized in the table below. We categorized potential news events into eight categories: BS (change in structure of Bitcoin), PO (personal opinions), GR (government regulation), OC (other currencies), NI (new investment opportunities), UI (under investigation), CS (cybersecurity), and NF (nothing found). Of these categories, we found that news about changes in the structure of Bitcoin (such as scaling and potential forks) had the largest effect on the price. Looking closer at the dates for which we did not find news about Bitcoin itself, thus categorized NF, we found there were often news releases about changes in major currencies around the world, such as large inflation of the euro or increases in the value of the dollar. Large changes in the price of Bitcoin on those days might be explained by these events, or might be instances of price changes driven by smaller numbers of individuals, as discussed above.

While the nature of the news events does not necessarily explain the magnitude of Bitcoin’s price changes or its daily volatility, it does suggest that the market is not being driven entirely by manipulation or the behavior of small numbers of traders. In the next brief in this series on AIER’s collaboration with the Missouri University of Science and Technology, we will look directly at Bitcoin’s volatility and compare it with that of widely used currencies and other assets."
2018-01-13 00:00:00+00:00	Will Cryptocurrencies Be the Art Market’s Next Big Thing?	['Scott Reyburn']	"But why Richard Prince?

“To make a ready-made we needed a signature, but we were no one in the art world,” Mr. Sarrouy said, adding that he and his friends had chosen Richard Prince “because he is the king of appropriation art.”

“Our artwork has been created by our own Richard Prince,” he said. “And then there is the famous Richard Prince.”

The appropriation of this name was certainly mischievous, given that the “famous” Richard Prince continues to be involved in a lawsuit concerning his appropriation of an Instagram-sourced photograph for a 2014 exhibition. Adding further confusion, Mr. Prince’s most recent show of paintings at the Gladstone Gallery was titled “Ripple,” which also happens to the name of a high-rising cryptocurrency.

Mr. Prince declined to comment for this column.

“The project is interesting,” said Judy Mam, an organizer of the Rare Digital Art Festival, referring to the Distributed Gallery’s Duchampian token. “But we’re talking about people who are putting up money,” she added. “That’s when the theoretical aspect of the project comes crashing down.” It no longer features in the festival program.

As of Wednesday, Distributed Gallery’s auction had attracted four participants, who bid in Ether up to a value of about $2,600. Three bidders who thought they were competing for a work by the “famous” Mr. Prince have received or are in the process of receiving a refund, according to Mr. Sarrouy. “The last one has bet knowing what this project was all about,” he said, “and is still the highest bidder.”"

After the year crypto had in 2017, it is hard to believe that bitcoin, altcoins, and initial coin offerings (ICOs) went years as hardly known commodities, relegated to subreddits and obscure forums.

However, now even my fellow gym rats (a term I use endearingly) in Oregon have heard of crypto and its incredible, bubble-like ascent. After all, it is hard to keep quiet about a technology that seemingly conjures billions of dollars worth of value seemingly overnight.

Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter & Facebook

These pages have documented the crypto phenomenon, with some amused derision, a number of times. And now that 2017 has come to a close, we can take a closer look at just how much ICOs have grown over 2017, and how traditional venture capitalists are investing in startups that power crypto using the blockchain.

ICOs Boom in 2017

Although reporting indicates that ICOs have been around since 2013, the funding model was relatively nascent until last year. Essentially, an ICO is kind of like crowdfunding, except backers receive newly-created tokens. It’s a way for companies in the crypto economy to raise capital and fund development. And, arguably, the booming popularity of raising funds through an ICO have helped put crypto into the mainstream.

According to Crunchbase’s tracking of ICOs, 2017 got off to a slow start. Only seven ICOs were documented in the first quarter of the year, raising an estimated $28 million. But by the next quarter, the number of ICOs increased by nearly 4 times to 25 known ICOs, while dollars raised increased by an estimated $402 million, bringing in a total estimated sum of $680 million.1

The pace of funding continued to raise across deal counts and amounts as 2017 marched forward. In the third quarter, ICOs broke over an estimated billion dollars raised for the first time and doubled the number of known deals. By the fourth quarter, known ICO deals and the estimated amounts raised nearly doubled again.

The end of year result? An estimated $4.9 billion was raised through ICOs in 2017, around the same amount reported by the Wall Street Journal in mid-December of last year.

A little under one billion of that amount went into two crypto-based startups, according to Crunchbase.

Taking the top spot for the year was Block.one, which raised $700 million in the fourth quarter as a result of its ICO. The company, which aims to create software “that promises to handle millions of transactions per second,” according to the Wall Street Journal, is now valued at $4.5 billion. And like many crypto startups, it has little to show from a product perspective.

Following Block.one’s massive ICO is Filecoin, which has raised an estimated $258 million. The company aims to create a distributed data storage network, and those who choose to participate in its network will earn the company’s crypto currency in exchange for computing resources. Filecoin is also notable for its buy-in from traditional VC investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, and Winklevoss Capital.

But while ICOs appear to be an incredibly expeditious way to raise an immense out of cash, it’s not known if the wild ride will continue. An incredible number of ICOs lack well-developed teams and are almost embarrassingly short of any reasonable business plan. And regulators aren’t ignorant. The SEC has issued guidance that ICOs can, indeed, be securities—putting ICOs in the same regulatory bucket as traditional public offerings.

It’s a messy world. And it’s one that may still yet justify capital from well-established tech investors.

New Technology, Same Investors

Prior to the popularity of ICOs, the main means of raising funds for a crypto startup followed a more traditional startup fundraising model: pounding the pavement of Sand Hill Road.

And pound they did. From 2012 to 2016, startups that developed or harnessed blockchain technology raised increasing sums of money from venture capitalists. Using data provided by Coindesk (a news publication that focuses on crypto), here’s how funding played out from 2012 to 2017 for blockchain-based startups, which you can observe in the chart below:

However, as you can see, deal counts peaked in 2014 and have not recovered since. And 2017 also marked the first time totals for funding into the space took a hit. (Crunchbase data indicates similar funding direction.)

There are a number of factors that could contribute to this dip.

It’s possible that VCs, much as they did with Filecoin, are quietly participating in funding events via ICOs. There is also talk that startups, especially early-stage startups, are forgoing the sometimes onerous terms VCs offer in favor of an ICO. Simply put: who needs venture capital when you can raise your seed, early, and late-stage funding all in one swoop, without all that pesky due diligence and talk of preferred shares with a coin offering?

Additionally, blockchain funding is experiencing a seed-stage crunch—a woe of the broader US startup and venture market. In 2014, an estimated 65 known seed-stage deals were reported in the CoinDesk dataset. By 2017, however, that number dropped to an estimated 11 known seed-stage startups being funded. Over half of the blockchain startups which raised VC funds are recorded as being based in the United States.

How long this boom will carry on is anyone’s guess. ICOs could continue to be popular funding methods, especially if VC interest in blockchain startups continues to decline, regulation stays uncertain, and the environment for early-stage startups maintains its drought-like conditions.

Or the bubble could pop tomorrow, marking 2018 as the year HODL breaks.

Crunchbase added ICO tracking in 2017. The funding method’s nascency means that we are walking in new pastures. As such, we have a slightly lower levels of confidence that any single dataset is fully accurate when it comes to ICOs. Datasets (some of which we have used in reporting) can differ in terms of when a funding is recorded, and, say, in terms handling pre-sales to ICOs proper. Regardless, Crunchbase News checked Crunchbase data against other data sources (using only intervals when they appeared to be updated regularly) and found our results to be contentedly in-line directionally.

Gans', 'Rabee Tourky']	We analyze the Bitcoin protocol for electronic peer-to-peer payments and the operations that support the “blockchain” that underpins it. It is shown that that protocol maps formally into a dynamic game that is an extension of standard models of R&D racing. The model provides a technical foundation for any economic analysis of ‘proof of work’ protocols. Using the model, we demonstrate that free entry is solely responsible for determining resource usage by the system for a given reward to mining. The endogenous level of computational difficulty built into the Bitcoin protocol does not mitigate this usage and serves only to determine the time taken to process transactions. Regulating market structure will mitigate resource use highlighting the importance of identifying the benefits of competition for the operation of the blockchain.
2017-12-04 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin and cryptocurrency on Twitter: The most important people to follow	['Jessica Marmor Shaw', 'Barbara Kollmeyer']	"It’s a new year, and for those of us in the newsroom who spend far too much time hunting tips, charts and RTs on Finance Twitter TWTR, +0.22% , that means one thing: time to update our annual list of who to follow.

Our 2016 edition was all about the names that might offer a heads-up on market tumult (remember when we were worried about that?!). For 2017, we put together a comprehensive list that, honestly, still stands for 2018. (A full roundup is available in one Twitter list right here.) This year... it’s all about crypto.

But before we dive head-first into the blockchain, we’ve been asking you, our readers, for 2018 nominees and a few of you spotted that we were under-representing accounts covering Asia. Here are a few of your nominees to correct that oversight: Comrade Balding @BaldingsWorld, managing director/chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management Patrick Chovanec @prchovanec, and the technical-analysis focused @Sunchartist.

From our newsroom, a few general tips: Author and never-Trumper Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) is an outspoken tweeter on politics with blistering retorts to those who claim their own facts. Check out Bama @Bamabroker if you’re looking for tweets about commodities. Investment advisor Ross Gerber @GerberKawasaki has racked up over 46,000 followers with his market following tweets. ValueWalk (@valuewalk) is a good all-arounder on hedge funds and value investing. And may we recommend WSJ Millennials @WizJourn — it’s as perfect as it sounds.

The 30 essential Crypto Twitter accounts to follow

Now let’s get down to it: 2017 was the year of the cryptocurrency. You know the story: Bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.74% exploded onto the scene this year with a 1,400% yearly gain (and plenty of volatility to go along with it). The total crypto market cap now stands at over $554 billion. Social chatter about the new asset class has blown up, and the followings of notable Crypto Twitter accounts have seen, well, crypto-like, 500%+ gains.

On this topic, EVERYONE has a differing opinion ranging from “fraud” to “the future” — and social media is often the place those opinions get aired and debated. Meanwhile, price moves happen quicker than you can tweet about it. For investors, sorting through the noise (not to mention the ICO pump and dumps) to find signals worth listening to is no easy thing.

Are cryptocurrencies a huge bubble, or just getting going? Is ether the next bitcoin? What’s the ideal crypto portfolio? Whatever your position, we hope these accounts will deliver the analysis and commentary you’re looking for in the year to come. (Who did we miss? Tell us in the comments below.)

VIPs and founders

Vitalik Buterin @VitalikButerin — AKA the “boy genius” of crypto — is a co-founder of decentralized cryptocurrency platform Ethereum. He’s Canadian/Russian and in his early twenties... and if you don’t know who he is it’s probably time to read this or this or this. Named to the Forbes 30 under 30 list. In January of 2017, Buterin had about 40,000 Twitter followers. Today, his following is over 514,000.

(For the story behind that tweet, go here.)

Charlie Lee@satoshilite is the creator of Litecoin and the ex-director of engineering at Coinbase. He’s active on Twitter, keeping up with every turn and hard fork in the road. He, too, has seen a massive follower growth in 2017 — from under 30K earlier this year to about 558,000 at latest check. He made headlines back in December for announcing he sold and donated his Litecoin stake to avoid conflicts of interest while overseeing the cryptocurrency’s growth.

Roger Ver@rogerkver claims to be the world’s first investor in bitcoin startups. He apparently used to be all about bitcoin, and now it’s Bitcoin Cash. Some would call him a little controversial.

Canadian entrepreneur Joseph Lubin @ethereumJoseph is another Ethereum co-founder, and founder of a blockchain software production studio called ConsenSys.

Barry Silbert@barrysilbert is the founder/CEO of Digital Currency Group and pink-sheet listed Bitcoin Investment Trust GBTC, -0.21% , the world’s first publicly traded bitcoin fund.

Gavin Andresen@gavinandresen was previously lead developer on Bitcoin Core, the original open source software created by Satoshi Nakamoto, and took over maintenance of the code directly from Nakamoto. He’s been called “the man who really built bitcoin,” and has drummed up a fair bit of controversy over the past few years.

His Fortress hedge fund shuttered after heavy losses, but Michael Novogratz @novogratz appears to be trying to reinvent himself as the “king of bitcoin.” If you’re looking for bold, bullish calls... you’ve found your guy. (Though that planned bitcoin hedge fund is no longer in the works, for the time being anyway.)

Andreas Antonopoulos@aantonop has been called a “primary thought-leader and ambassador on bitcoin” by CoinDesk and made their top list of influencers several times over, including a spot at No. 1 in 2014. He literally wrote the book on it (or one of them — “Mastering Bitcoin”) and he’s a frequent crypto conference headliner. His feed often points to explainers and how-tos on his YouTube channel:

Analysts

Alex Sunnarborg@alexsunnarborg, former research analyst at digital asset broker Coinbase is a founding partner at Tetras Capital, a hedge fund that focuses on diversified blockchain, crypto and digital assets. He’s also on CoinDesk’s list of top 10 traders and analysts. He’s good for charts, stats and more.

Spencer Bogart aka @CremeDeLaCrypto also makes that CoinDesk list, and was one of the first Wall Street analysts to focus on cryptocurrencies. He’s now a researcher for investment fund Blockchain Capital, and also shows up on Forbes with some stuff that’s written in layman’s terms.

One more from the CoinDesk list: Willy Woo @woonomic produces “some of the highest-quality and most creative charts in the industry.”

Author and commodity trader Peter Brandt @PeterLBrandt now also trades and offers commentary and charts on bitcoin. Extra points for his informative AMAs on Twitter, like this one.

Ronnie Moas@RonnieMoas, independent analyst and founder at Standpoint Research, is worth following just to see how high the bar is being set for bitcoin right now (He once said it’ll catch up with Apple’s AAPL, -0.93% market cap within five years). He does plenty of research to back up his calls. He’s not just into bitcoin, but you’re going to have to subscribe for that research.

Investors and miners

Wences Casares @wences was called the “Patient Zero for bitcoin in Silicon Valley” by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. He’s more of a retweeter than a tweeter. He’s also garnered some fame over this YouTube video — circa 2014 — that explained how bitcoin would get to a billion users.

Jameson Lopp@lopp is an engineer at blockchain security company BitGo and the author of this tweet that got passed around feverishly as bitcoin was hitting new highs mid-November:

Balaji S. Srinivasan @balajis is the CEO of Earn.com, formerly 21 Inc., a well funded blockchain startup that helps its users make money by creating public profiles for receiving paid messages, or completing small tasks. Like Twitter TWTR, +0.22% , but “you’re not just wasting time, you’re making money,” is how Srinivasan put it anyway (and CoinDesk has a writeup of what it’s all about here). Like most of the folks on this list, he’s got some pretty strong convictions about where this crypto thing is going:

Alvin Lee tweeting @onemanatatime describes himself as a veteran crypto trader and entrepreneur, blogging at Aluna Cyrpto blogspot. For example, in “Top 5 things cryptocurrency traders can learn from poker players,” he talks about how much you should really risk (the answer: a tiny percentage of your overall capital).

BTF%$D@CryptoHustle is a full-time crypto trader. On his website, he offers up a free masterclass on bitcoin. Over on Twitter, he’s got plenty to say on bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, market sentiment and swearword-laced, crypto-style philosophy:

@westcoastbill — Bill Lee is the founding chairman of BitGo and a Silicon Valley angel who has a lot of notable investments — Tesla TSLA, +1.11% , Space X, bitcoin and Coinbase.

@CharlieShrem: first bitcoin felon? Charlie Shrem, entrepreneur and early bitcoin advocate, did jail time for helping a customer get bitcoins to resell on the now-shuttered Silk Road. Shrem dusted himself off and is keeping pretty busy with a hand in all sorts of projects. He has no shortage of fans, with some 65,000 followers.

Linda Xie@ljxie is a Coinbase product manager and a good one to follow for explainers and news on alternate cryptocurrencies. She’s got beginner guides up on Bitcoin Cash, Monero and more, and points her followers to them, along with tips like these:

Blockchain tech

Jihan Wu @JihanWu is co-founder of BITMAIN, which has been called perhaps “the most influential company in the bitcoin economy by virtue of the sheer amount of processing power, or hash rate, that it controls.”

@starkness — Elizabeth Stark is the co-founder of @lightning, a so-called open protocol layer that leverages blockchains and smart contracts to “make cheap, fast, private transactions available to anyone around the world.”

Perianne Boring@PerianneDC is a blockchain advocate and founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Congress, which bills itself as a leading trade association representing blockchain. She’s also out to educate:

Nick Szabo@NickSzabo4 is a highly followed cryptographer and blogger, known as one of the pioneers of blockchain. He’s one to follow on issues of scalability and security.

Adam Back@adam3us, CEO of Blockstream, a big provider of blockchain technologies, and inventor of hashcash, the proof-of-work algorithm used in bitcoin mining. He seems pretty big on educating the public, and, well, his bio may make your head spin.

Commentary

Don’t let the fact that we’ve come this far in the list before getting to WhalePanda @WhalePanda deter you: this is pretty much a must-follow when it comes to crypto.

Chris Burniske@cburniske the author of “Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor’s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond” offers a balanced, if bullish, perspective on the crypto space with tweets that tend to be investor-focused and easy to get your head around for the newbies.

Investor and fintech/hard-money analyst Tuur Demeester @TuurDemeester is worth a follow if you’re interested in easy-to-read charts and a greater market perspective:

“Into crypto before it was cool,” is how Arianna Simpson — @AriannaSimpson — describes herself. She’s an early-stage investor in startups and also has held roles at BitGo and Facebook. She doles out all sorts of advice:

Plus a dozen more...

We’ve tried to offer up a curated list above of must-follow accounts that are consistently active, influential, and bring something unique to the table. But there are dozens (hundreds! thousands!) more out there, each offering up something slightly different. Here are a dozen more names, if the 30 we called out above aren’t enough for you.

Blockchain experts and advocates: Neha Narula @neha is the director of digital currency at MIT Media Lab; cryptography consultant Peter Todd @petertoddbtc; Meltem Demirors — @Melt_Dem — is a director at Digital Currency Group; Elizabeth Rossiello @e_rossiello hasn’t tweeted in awhile, but is founder of a blockchain payments startup. Luke Martin @VentureCoinist is one to follow for charts, and you might also add derivatives trader and consultant Tone Vays @ToneVays.

Other crypto big wigs: Fred Ehrsam @FEhrsam, previous Coinbase co-founder; Brian Armstrong @brian_armstrong, another Coinbase co-founder and its current CEO; Tony Gallippi @TonyGallippi is the co-founder and Executive Chairman of BitPay. NEO founder Da Hongfei @dahongfei, Jackson Palmer @ummjackson, creator of @dogecoin, could also make your follow list. The Winklevii accounts are nearly all RTs these days, but should you feel the need to follow the first reported bitcoin billionaires, they are @winklevoss and @tylerwinklevoss.

Yes, we undoubtedly missed some good ones. So let us know in the comments section which accounts you think are a must-follow."
2017-12-07 03:24:36+00:00	Hackers steal $64 million from cryptocurrency firm NiceHash	['Jim Finkle', 'Jeremy Wagstaff']	"(Reuters) - A Slovenian cryptocurrency mining marketplace, NiceHash, said it lost about $64 million worth of bitcoin in a hack of its payment system, the latest incident to highlight risks that uneven oversight and security pose to booming digital currencies.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

NiceHash matches people looking to sell processing time on computers in exchange for bitcoin.

There have been at least three dozen heists on exchanges that buy and sell digital currencies since 2011, including one that led to the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin market.

More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges, which would be worth more than $15 billion at current exchange rates. Few have been recovered, leaving some investors without any compensation.

The hacks have not kept demand for digital currencies from soaring. Bitcoin’s value has climbed more than 15-fold so far this year, closing at a record $16,000 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Thursday, ahead of this weekend’s launch of bitcoin futures by CBOE.

Security experts said they expect the cyber-crime spree to pick up as the rising valuations attract interest from cyber criminals looking for victims that lack experience defending against hacks.

“These exchanges are not in my opinion secure,” said Gartner security analyst Avivah Litan. “You don’t know what their security is like behind the scenes.”

NiceHash executive Andrej P. Škraba told Reuters that his firm was the victim of “a highly professional” heist that yielded about 4,700 bitcoin, worth around $64 million.

Sophisticated criminal groups are increasingly targeting the cryptocurrency industry, focusing on exchanges and other types of firms in the sector, said Noam Jolles, a senior intelligence specialist with Israeli cyber-security company Diskin Advanced Technologies.

“The most sophisticated groups are going into this area,” she said.

NiceHash, which advised users to change online passwords after it halted operations on Wednesday, has provided few other details about the attack on its payment system.

“We ask for patience and understanding while we investigate the causes and find the appropriate solutions for the future of the service,” it said on its website.

It was unclear whether customers faced any losses from the hack.

Slovenian police said they were looking into the hack, but declined to elaborate."

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s spy agency said North Korean hackers were behind attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges this year in which some 7.6 billion won ($6.99 million) worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen, a newspaper reported on Saturday.

The cyber attacks attributed to North Korean hackers also included the leaking of personal information from 36,000 accounts from the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchange Bitthumb in June, South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo reported, citing the country’s National Intelligence Service (NIS).

Attacks also included the theft of cryptocurrencies from accounts at exchanges Yapizon, now called Youbit, and Coinis in April and September, it said.

The 7.6 billion won of stolen cryptocurrencies are now worth about 90 billion won ($82.7 million), Chosun Ilbo reported. It also cited the NIS as saying North Korean hackers had also demanded 6 billion won ($5.5 million) from Bitthumb in return for deleting the leaked personal information.

Another cyber attack on about 10 cryptocurrency exchanges by North Korean hackers in October, using emails containing malware, was thwarted by the Korea Internet Security Agency (KISA), the newspaper reported.

The NIS found that the malware used in hacking the exchanges was made with the same method as malware used in hacking Sony Pictures and the central bank of Bangladesh in 2014 and 2016 respectively, the Chosun Ilbo reported.

The NIS also said emails used in the attacks used North Korean internet addresses, according to the Chosun Ilbo.

The NIS declined to comment. Representatives for KISA, Bitthumb, Youbit and Coinis could not be reached for comment.

2018-01-19 00:00:00+00:00	Northwest Companies Raise Big Dough With Virtual Currencies Amid Security Warnings	['Tom Banse', 'Dori Luzzo Gilmour', 'Courtney Flatt']	"A quartet of young companies from the Seattle area have raised tens of millions of dollars by tapping into a hot tech trend. They’ve invented new virtual currencies and sold digital coins to the public.

These token sales are largely unregulated and are sparking increasingly frequent government warnings.

Seattle-based Coinme is one of the companies backing its own digital-only currency. Coinme CEO and Co-founder Neil Bergquist envisions a “a crypto ATM on every corner, worldwide.” That means a bitcoin cash machine, basically, where anyone can buy or redeem virtual currencies with dollars and a driver license.

“When you have a trusted kiosk and a physical place with a 1-800 number, with a 5-star (review) on Google, that is how you can bring cryptocurrencies mainstream,” Bergquist said.

To achieve this vision, the four-year-old company needs money to expand its ATM network. It has about 40 bitcoin ATMs deployed now, concentrated in California, Texas and Washington state.

“We have done everything to finance this business to get to here,” Bergquist said with feeling. “Whether it’s a bitcoin loan, or a revenue sharing agreement, hard money lending, LendingClub.com loans, credit cards, mortgaging houses.”

But none of the traditional sources was nearly as fruitful as this new thing in tech circles—the “initial coin offering” or ICO. That sounds like IPO, an initial public offering of stock in a company, but it’s not. It’s more like crowdfunding. ICO purchasers get virtual money that can often be used like a digital coupon, but no shareholder equity.

“It really was a unique opportunity,” Bergquist said. “Well, let’s engage our community of local crypto-enthusiasts, but also global enthusiasts who also want to give the world access to cryptocurrency. Let’s engage them in the form of our own cryptocurrency.”

Coinme raised nearly $19 million over two months in its crowd sale of its new currency called UpToken. You can’t buy things in the real world with it, but users get discounts or rebates on future ATM transaction fees.

Other area companies raised even more money in their initial coin offerings.

Competitive video gaming—also known as esports—bookmaker Unikrn sold more than $31 million worth of a new currency called UnikoinGold that can be used for internet betting.

StormX, Inc. netted over $32 million by selling it’s Storm Token currency to use on a platform where freelancers can take on “micro tasks.”

A spinoff of the Walt Disney Company’s tech center in Seattle called Dragonchain raised close to $13 million by creating Dragons, an alt-coin that can be used to buy business services. The CEO said the token sale proceeds are now worth much more because they were saved in rapidly-appreciating bitcoin and ethereum.

This all comes against a backdrop of warnings from regulators to investors to be wary.

“These are high risk products that have an unproven track record and obviously have high volatility in their prices that are reported,” said Faith Anderson, a securities lawyer at the Washington state Department of Financial Institutions.

“They are subject to little or no regulation. They are subject to cybersecurity breaches and outright theft,” she said. “You can in fact lose your entire investment in a cryptocurrency.”

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton has also urged investors to ask a lot of questions and “apply common sense” before entering the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market. The SEC has cracked down on a handful of ICOs, none of which involved Pacific Northwest companies.

Anderson sees signs of “a lot of speculation, which raises a lot of concern.” But she’s not pointing fingers at any Pacific Northwest cryptocurrency issuers.

Those companies say they’re glad that federal and state regulators are watching out for frauds. For regulatory compliance reasons, several of the CEOs insisted consumers should not treat the digital money they coined as investments.

“A Dragon is not a financial security and should not be purchased for investment or speculative purposes,” Dragonchain CEO Joe Roets said in a slide presentation for token pre-sale audiences.

But many token buyers from all over the world have an investor mentality judging from online comment threads at popular cryptocurrency message boards on websites such as Reddit and Telegram. The buyers anticipate handsome profits from trading the virtual currencies on secondary markets.

University of Kansas student Shaher Ibrahimi said he bought the equivalent of “a good, used car’s worth” of Coinme’s new UpToken currency during the initial coin offering in December. Ibrahimi said he got in on bitcoin earlier, but this was the first ICO he participated in. He liked that Coinme had a business track record and is U.S.-based.

“There are a lot of initial coin offerings that are BS,” Ibrahimi said. “You have to kind of get through the weeds and figure out what is a legit company and what isn’t a legit company. There is no doubt about Coinme.”

“Since we’re in the early adoption stages… my intuition said this is a good investment,” he added. “There is going to be some risk involved, so you have to keep track of it. But it has a lot of potential.”

Sure enough, the value of three of the four locally-invented tokens shot upwards after they recently started trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. But since then it’s been a wild ride on the markets with volatility on stark display.

The Unikoin Gold, Dragon and Storm cryptocurrencies plunged early this week in a sector-wide selloff. Uptoken is not yet trading.

The website CoinMarketCap.com tracks 1,450 different cryptocurrencies, most of which are less than a year old. Actions by regulators overseas—notably in China and South Korea—to crack down on what they see as an investment craze contributed to Tuesday’s plunge in cryptocurrencies.

For ICO issuers, it may seem like manna from heaven to jump on the internet money bandwagon, but Coinme CEO Bergquist disagrees. He said with a weary sigh that his company’s token offering was a “consuming process.”

“The easy money is gone. It’s not easy anymore. It is a massive effort” to break through the ICO noise, Bergquist said in an interview after the token sale closed."
