It’s been a rocky start to the year for Bitcoin, but experts still say it will hit $100,000 — and that it’s more a matter of when, not if.

Bitcoin’s price slipped back down slightly at the start of the week but there’s still more momentum behind digital assets as of late compared to a few weeks ago. Last week, bitcoin surged to its highest price since the crypto market crashed in June, hitting $24,000. This uptick came after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.75% and an economic report revealed the U.S. GDP fell for two consecutive quarters, which suggests that investors were already expecting those two outcomes.

The largest crypto fell below $23,000 on Tuesday but was still up more than 8% in the last week.

“Bitcoin is finishing the week near the highs, just shy of the $24,000 level as the cryptoverse breathes a sigh of relief. ​ The ‘crypto winter’ might be over and that is what is needed to allow flows back into the space,” says Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker Oanda.

Moya says Bitcoin is showing some signs of stabilizing lately, but the market may not be out of the danger zone yet. Bitcoin has fallen below $20,000 — a key price point — several times in recent weeks and the “majority of crypto watchers are still awaiting further weakness and possible retest of the June lows,” he says.

The latest crypto market crash in June was spurred by momentary de-risking from Wall Street as many investors are feeling pessimistic about the economy amid surging inflation, a shaky stock market, and rising interest rates. The crypto market has increasingly tracked the stock market in recent months, which makes it even more intertwined with global economic factors.

In addition to macroeconomic factors, Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at Uphold, says investors are nervous about the crypto industry’s long-term viability after several major crypto players halted withdrawals, cut jobs, and tried to stem losses in recent weeks. However, crypto prices are much more vulnerable to factors contributing to the difficult economic situation than the pullback in the crypto ecosystem, he says.

“The market remains vulnerable and on edge, not necessarily by threats from more crypto projects going bust but from the difficult economic situation we are facing right now,” Hiesboeck says. “In other words, the price of bitcoin depends more on the supply of gas to Germany as it does in any crypto-related news or metric.”

With no end in sight, the war, inflation, and shifting monetary policy in the U.S. will likely continue to drive more volatility in the coming weeks and months, experts say.

Bitcoin has only been above $45,000 for a few short stretches over the past six months, and hasn’t been above $50,000 since Dec. 25, 2021. Amid the ups and downs, Bitcoin’s current price is a long way off from the latest all-time high it hit in November, when it went over $68,000. But even with the recent decline in price, Bitcoin is still more than twice as valuable as it was just a couple years ago. For Bitcoin, these kinds of ups and downs are nothing new.

One Week Ago (July 26) One Month Ago (July 3) 3 Months Ago (May 4) $21,330.30 $19,268.23 $37,758.50

Prices updated: August 2, 2022

Despite the volatility and recent slumping price, many experts still say Bitcoin is on its way to passing the $100,000 mark, though with varying opinions on exactly when that will happen. And a recent study by Deutsche Bank found that about a quarter of Bitcoin investors believe Bitcoin prices will be over $110,000 in five years.

The volatility is nothing new, and is a big reason experts say new crypto investors should be extremely cautious when allocating part of their portfolio to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has shown as steady a rise in value over the years as any other cryptocurrency on the market. It’s only reasonable for Bitcoin investors to be curious about how high it can ultimately go.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin’s price is extremely difficult to predict and even more susceptible to market factors than more established asset classes. But we decided to ask some experts for their best guesses anyway. Here’s what they said:

Bitcoin Price Predictions

It was easy to predict a $100,000 Bitcoin price late last year, coming off its latest all-time high in November. With Bitcoin’s big fall since then, the prediction game is even trickier.

The most extreme crypto skeptics say Bitcoin will tank to as low as $10,000 in 2022, but a middle ground might be to say the cryptocurrency can still climb to $100,000 like many experts predicted late last year — just on a slower timeline.

“The most knowledgeable educators in the space are predicting $100,000 Bitcoin in Q1 2022 or sooner,” Kate Waltman, a New York-based certified public accountant who specializes in crypto, told us back in November 2021.

But now, bullish experts are re-evaluating the crypto industry altogether as major corporations like Nike and other big brands are looking at ways to monetize their products in the digital metaverse. The rise of metaverse games, worlds, products, and experiences is increasing the popularity of altcoins, which has changed investors’ sentiments about Bitcoin (known as the original crypto).

Many experts are hesitant to predict a number and a date, but rather point to the trend of Bitcoin increasing its value over time. Investors should expect a “pretty sustainable” rise in Bitcoin’s long-term value driven by organic market movement, with the $100,000 threshold in near-sight, predicted Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, last October.

“What I expect from Bitcoin is volatility [in the] short-term and growth [in the] long-term,” says Kiana Danial, founder of Invest Diva and author of “Cryptocurrency Investing For Dummies.”

Here are some more predictions we found, ranked from low to high over the next year:

Bitcoin investor and founder of crypto research and media company Token Metrics Prediction: Bitcoin can go to $100,000-$150,000, but the timeline is unclear

Bitcoin can go to $100,000-$150,000, but the timeline is unclear Why: Bitcoin is in a bearish sentiment cycle, but the total crypto market and other crypto asset classes are not. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but now others have surpassed it in innovation when it comes to what experts call “Web 3” — aka the new internet built on blockchain. The release of new altcoins and hype about the metaverse will continue to drive the demand for crypto, and Bitcoin will therefore bounce back eventually.

Technical analysis and blockchain data analyst Prediction: Bitcoin can reach $100,000 in 2022

Bitcoin can reach $100,000 in 2022 Why: The price of Bitcoin in January 2022 is almost equal to its price in January 2021, but there’s a new demand for altcoins. There’s also an ongoing trend of Bitcoin supply leaving major exchanges (presumably to be stored in offline crypto wallets), Hyland said in a tweet. He also recently tweeted that a dip below $40,000 could lead to “free fall” into a Bitcoin bear market.

Robert Breedlove

Point of View: Founder and CEO of the digital assets marketing and consulting firm Parallax Digital

Founder and CEO of the digital assets marketing and consulting firm Parallax Digital Prediction: $307,000 by October 2021 (now passed), and $12.5 million by 2031

$307,000 by October 2021 (now passed), and $12.5 million by 2031 Why: Inflationary pressures after COVID-19 will drive interest in cryptocurrency, pushing the value of Bitcoin up higher than previous projections estimated, Breedlove said in an interview earlier this year. Known as more of a philosopher type among crypto enthusiasts, Breedlove speaks often about the broader social implications of crypto as a form of more transparent, decentralized currency — but his price predictions haven’t exactly been spot-on.

Big financial institutions have made their own predictions, as well, with JPMorgan predicting a long-term high of $146,000 and Bloomberg predicting it could hit $400,000 if the currency climbs at rates comparable to the past.

Pro Tip Even if Bitcoin breaks $100,000, stay focused building on your overall portfolio including passive index funds, emergency savings, and your retirement account(s).

What Influences Bitcoin’s Price

Normal economic factors influence the price of cryptocurrency just like any other currency or investment — supply and demand, public sentiment, the news cycle, market events, scarcity, and more.

As a new and emerging asset, additional factors influence Bitcoin’s value more than the average currency or security. Here are some:

Scarcity

There are only 18 to 19 million Bitcoins currently in circulation, and minting will stop at 21 million. Industry experts consistently point to this built-in scarcity as a big part of cryptocurrency’s appeal.

“There’s a fixed supply but increasing demand,” says Alexis Johnson, president of the blockchain public relations and events company, Light Node Media.

Other experts point out Bitcoin has value because people give it value. “That’s really why everybody’s buying — because of the psychological aspect,” says Nelson Merchan, Johnson’s Light Node Media co-founder. That can make it difficult for the average consumer to discern whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are legitimate. The whole concept of supply and demand only works when people want something scarce — even if it previously didn’t exist.

“It actually does almost kind of seem like a scam,” Merchan says about Bitcoin’s origins. Though he says he’s seen his crypto holdings reach millions at times since he began investing in 2017, he’s also seen them disappear in an instant.

“I’m a big believer that if it’s not in cash, you don’t really have that money because in crypto, anything can drop dramatically overnight,” Merchan says. This is why certified financial planners suggest only allocating 1% to 5% of your portfolio to crypto — to protect your money from the volatility.

Mainstream Adoption

One of the main factors driving the price increase of Bitcoin is the rate at which new consumers are buying and exploring cryptocurrency, says Waltman.

“Crypto technology is being adopted at a faster rate than humans first adopted internet technology,” she says. Assuming it continues, the compounding acceleration of new adoption could keep pushing the value of Bitcoin higher and higher.

Bitcoin adoption has been increasing at an annual rate of 113%, according to data from the digital asset management firm CoinShares. (Meanwhile, people adopted the internet at a slower rate of 63%.) If people warm up to Bitcoin at a comparable rate to that of the internet’s early days (or faster), the report makes the case that there will be 1 billion users by 2024 and 4 billion users by 2030.

CoinDesk reported last month the number of new wallets worldwide increased 45% from January 2020 to January 2021, to an estimated 66 million. Popular crypto exchange Coinbase says it has now over 73 million worldwide users, while fellow exchange Gemini recently released its “State of U.S. Crypto Report,” which found 21.2 million Americans own cryptocurrency of some kind.

Regulation

Federal officials have made it clear in recent months they are paying attention to crypto. Industry professionals have recently alluded to what crypto insiders perceive as “hawkish” federal regulation being one key driver for Bitcoin’s lagging price. In a recent CoinDesk First Mover interview, Seth Ginns, a CoinFund managing partner, said “the Fed moved to a hawkish position [on crypto regulation] just as Omicron started to tick up in the U.S.,” which could have increased doubt in crypto as a viable asset—resulting in January’s bearish sentiments.

Crypto regulation brings up a lot of unanswered questions. President Joe Biden recently signed an infrastructure bill requiring all crypto exchanges to notify the IRS of their transactions. Similarly, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently said stablecoins — a type of crypto linked to the value of the U.S. dollar — should be subject to federal oversight.

The conversation on regulatory policies is “patchy,” said an industry white paper published by Flourish, a fintech platform designed for investment advisors. With a relatively new asset class like cryptocurrency, any new regulation has potential to impact value.

When China banned crypto in September 2021, for instance, investors saw the price of Bitcoin drop, though it has since risen and resumed its usual volatility. Even though there’s now about a decade of precedent for Bitcoin, the Securities and Exchange Commission is taking all decisions on a case-by-base basis in what experts refer to as its “crawl, walk, run” strategy toward mainstream crypto adoption.

“[Regulation has] kind of evolved over the last five years,” says Ben Cruikshank, head of Flourish, “Regulators can always change their mind.”

Mining Cycles

Finally, another major influence on Bitcoin’s price is a cycle known as halving. It’s complicated and algorithmic in nature, but in essence halving is a step in the Bitcoin mining process that results in the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions getting cut in half.

Halving influences the rate at which new coins enter circulation, which can impact the value of existing Bitcoin holdings. Historically, halvings have correlated with boom and bust cycles. Some experts try to predict these cycles down to the day after a halving event concludes.

What Investors Need to Know About Bitcoin Price Projections

As with any investment, financial planners and other experts advise against letting Bitcoin’s price fluctuations lead you to emotional decision making. Studies have shown investors who contribute regularly to passive index funds and ETFs perform better over time, thanks to a strategy called dollar cost averaging.

That’s part of why experts recommend not investing more than 5% of your overall portfolio in cryptocurrency, and never to invest at the expense of saving for emergencies and paying down high-interest debt. The path to long-term wealth and saving for retirement is most often successful for people with diversified investments like low-cost index funds, with crypto making up a very small part.

And even with crypto, experts say a set-it-and-forget-it approach makes sense. “Passive investing is a very valid way to achieve financial goals,” says Arkansas-based certified financial planner Sarah Catherine Gutierrez.

Since crypto is still new to most people, it’s OK to wait and see how things unfold before putting your money on the line. We only have about 10 years of data to inform crypto price predictions, and the value of Bitcoin — while potentially climbing long-term — is highly volatile from day to day.

Volatility makes it hard to know the “what” and “why” behind your crypto strategy. Before investing in Bitcoin or any alternative assets, ask yourself what you want to achieve from your participation in this particularly volatile market, and why. That will help you stay focused.

“I don’t think people understand across the board how to value [Bitcoin],” says Gutierrez. “When you’re buying it, you need to know your expectation of what value you’re going to get from what you’re buying.”

Financial planners don’t have a bias against cryptocurrency, Gutierrez says, particularly if a client expresses an interest in learning about it. However, you should ask yourself whether you need crypto as part of your plan. In most cases, says Gutierrez, the answer is no.

“Our take is that we don’t think you need Bitcoin in order to reach financial goals,” she says, adding that the average person should favor simple ways of investing that are easy to understand. This will keep you on track for core financial goals and better position you long-term for a healthy retirement."

Here are 5 things that happened in the space this past week	['Taylor Locke']	"NFT.NYC signage outside the Nasdaq MarketSite during the Annual NonFungible Token (NFT) Event in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.

1. Over 5,000 people attend NFT.NYC conference

To celebrate their love for NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, over 5,000 people attended the NFT.NYC conference in Manhattan last week. The highly anticipated event, which left 3,000 people on a waitlist, began on November 1 and ended on Thursday. The week included 600 speakers on panels, as well as parties, dinners, raves, galleries and attractions. The people behind notable NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club threw an actual yacht party on the Hudson River, along with an owners-only concert by The Strokes at music venue Brooklyn Steel. NFT enthusiasts, top crypto influencers and mainstream celebrities all attended, including director Quentin Tarantino, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and comedian Chris Rock, to name a few. Throughout, attendees traded 700,000 event NFTs, according to CoinDesk.

2. 'Squid Game'-inspired cryptocurrency crashes

A cryptocurrency inspired by Netflix's hit TV series ""Squid Game"" crashed after its founders cashed out, CNBC reported on Tuesday. The token, called SQUID, hit a high of just over $2,861 on Nov. 1 before plummeting to near zero, according to price-tracking website CoinMarketCap.

CoinMarketCap issued a warning that it received ""multiple reports"" that users were unable able to sell the token on Pancakeswap, a popular decentralized exchange, and the token's white paper and website have since disappeared. It seems that the token's creators collected at least $3.4 million in investor funds. The incident appears to be a so-called ""rug pull,"" where project founders abandon a project and take investor funds with them.

3. Quentin Tarantino to offer seven uncut scenes from ‘Pulp Fiction’ as NFTs

On Tuesday, Quentin Tarantino announced plans to sell seven uncut scenes from ""Pulp Fiction"" as NFTs. Each will also include handwritten scripts from the film and audio commentary from Tarantino himself, which will only be able to be seen by owners of the NFT. The NFTs will be auctioned on marketplace OpenSea. A launch date has not yet been announced.

4. Incoming NY mayor Eric Adams vows to take first three paychecks in bitcoin

New York City mayor-elect Eric Adams plans to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin, he said in a tweet on Thursday. ""NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry,"" Adams wrote. On Wednesday, Adams also said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio that he wanted to wager a ""friendly competition"" with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who is a big bitcoin supporter. ""He has a MiamiCoin that is doing very well — we're going to look in the direction to carry that out,"" Adams told Bloomberg Radio, alluding that he's looking into creating a city coin for New York that is similar to Miami's.

Bitcoin fell sharply alongside other assets on Friday, hitting a seven-week low and officially entering bear market territory.

The world's biggest cryptocurrency sank nearly 8% in the last 24 hours to $54,321, according to Coin Metrics data. The slide brought bitcoin to its lowest level since early October.

Bitcoin is down more than 20% from an all-time high of nearly $69,000 which it hit earlier this month. Bear markets are typically defined by a decline of 20% or more from recent highs.

Other cryptocurrencies also plunged Friday. Ether, the second-biggest crypto, fell more than 10% to $4,059, while XRP slumped 9.9% to just under 95 cents.

Digital currencies are falling in tandem with other risk assets amid panic over a new, heavily-mutated variant of the coronavirus first detected in South Africa."

Bitcoin Leads the Drop

Bitcoin is leading markets into the red during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. BTC has lost 7.3% over the past 24 hours in a fall to around $61K at the time of writing.

The king of crypto has retreated 11.6% from its Nov. 10 all-time high of a touch over $69K. Pricing models such as stock-to-flow are still predicting larger gains for Bitcoin before the end of this year with a target price of $135K painted.

Despite this latest loss, BTC has still more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year when it was trading at around $29K. According to Tradingview, there is support at the 50-day moving average which is around the $58,800 price zone.

Bitcoin’s fall comes just a day or so after its Taproot privacy upgrade went live with no issues.

Altcoins Bleeding in Crypto Plunge

As usual, the rest of the crypto market is being dragged down by big brother. Ethereum has retreated 8% on the day in a tumble to $4,329 at the time of writing. ETH has now lost 11.2% from its all-time high of $4,878 also on Nov. 10.

The altcoin market is a sea of red at the moment with no token in the top 50 making a gain today. Binance Coin, Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Polkadot have all lost between 6% and 11% over the past 24 hours.

Larger losses are being felt by other altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Crypto.com (CRO) which have all decreased more than 12% on the day."
2021-11-26 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin retreats 20% from record, joining risk-asset sell-off	['Joanna Ossinger', 'Emily Graffeo']	"Bitcoin fell as much as 9 percent to $53,552 while Ether dropped more than 12 percent on Friday.

Bitcoin tumbled 20% from the record high it notched earlier this month as a potentially worrisome new variant of the coronavirus spurred traders to dump risk assets across the globe.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 9% to $53,552 on Friday. Ether, the second-largest digital currency, dropped more than 12%, while the wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index declined as much as 7.7%.

A new variant identified in southern Africa spurred liquidations across global markets, with European stocks falling the most since July and U.S. equity benchmarks also trading lower. Bitcoin wasn’t spared from the carnage despite increasingly being seen by many crypto enthusiasts as a hedge against financial-market turmoil. And even as Bitcoin has gained more mainstream acceptance, the cryptocurrency is still prone to wild swings.

“To us, it is still by and large a risk asset,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. “When things get kind of scary, there are going to be sellers.”

Meanwhile, gold — a traditional safe-haven asset — climbed as much as 1.5% Friday morning, though the precious metal has still significantly underperformed Bitcoin year to date.

“I think the role that Bitcoin will eventually play is still uncertain. The role that something like gold and Treasuries play is pretty well known at this point. So the conclusion is that when things really look ugly, the traditional safe havens will rise to the top,” Mayfield added.

The variant news that roiled markets wasn’t the only negative factor weighing on Bitcoin. Coming into this week, analysts cited a number of crypto obstacles including U.S. tax-reporting requirements for digital currencies, China’s intensifying regulatory clampdown, and India’s sights on a new bill that could ban most private cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has been under pressure since reaching a record of almost $69,000 earlier this month on enthusiasm over the first U.S. exchange-traded fund linked to futures on the digital asset. It is currently sitting near its 100-day moving average of $53,940, which served as support during its late-September pullback.

“Ironically, yesterday afternoon crypto markets were starting to look pretty optimistic with hopes of a Santa Claus rally,” said Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at crypto-derivatives exchange FTX, in a note Friday. It “will be a nervous weekend for sure.”

As ever, bulls remain committed to the view that more institutions and retail investors will embrace virtual currencies.

“This is a market reaction/correction within an uptrend,” said Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific at Luno Pte., who pointed out that options-expiration days — like Friday — can often be volatile. He said a drop down to the $48,000 to $50,000 range might be more concerning, and that “20% pullbacks are normal in a Bitcoin uptrend as we’ve seen many times before.”

Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said in a note Friday that two consecutive daily closes below the $52,900 level would increase the risk of a deeper pullback toward the next support level near $44,200. But that’s not a reason to sell, she said.

“We would hold long positions, for now, given the likelihood of a snapback rally in the days ahead from oversold territory noting intermediate-term momentum remains to the upside,” Stockton said.

For now, Bitcoin’s pullback is a sideshow to the global market declines on the new variant identified as B.1.1.529 as policy makers rush to retool cross-border travel policies.

The largest token is still up more than 85% this year."

Building wealth is a long-term process and requires disciplined efforts. Investing a small amount at regular intervals is the prudent way forward, rather than investing in one go. It helps to ride out the wave of volatility. Attempting to time the market is a pretty flawed approach and does not work most of the time. Cryptocurrencies have steadily transitioned into an asset class that has the potential to deliver better returns than most other asset classes. However, it comes with a greater risk than many other asset classes. Investors should ideally not put more than 5-7% of their net worth into cryptocurrencies.

There are still many sectors and projects within the crypto ecosystem that are undervalued and have massive growth potential. Investing in baskets of tokens that revolve around a particular theme could be a prudent way to diversify the risks associated. As long as the investor has a long-term vision, it is always a good time to enter the cryptocurrency market.

Check latest rates	[]	"Bitcoin price continued its slide as the digital token slipped below $57,000 for the first time since October, in a retreat from record highs. he world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency was trading over 6% lower at $56,328.8. Bitcoin recently hit record high of around $69,000 and is up over 93% this year (year-to-date or YTD) so far.

Global crypto market cap slipped to $2.6 trillion, according tracker CoinGecko. Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, while Ether is up about sixfold. Both scaled records last week amid a fervor for digital assets driven by speculative demand and controversial arguments that they can hedge inflation risks.

“Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major altcoins have remained subdued almost 3 days in succession. On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin can be seen traversing within a channel pattern, frequently retesting the support of $58,000 mark. The RSI indicator has fallen below 40, a sign that the token is close to being oversold. We could soon expect a reversal in the trends based on the current scenario and the general optimism surrounding bitcoin,"" said Siddharth Menon, COO of WazirX.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest cryptocurrency, also declined more than 4% to $4,075. Ether price has been trading around all-time high, catching up with bitcoin's rally and riding on news of wider blockchain adoption.

""The bullish market for two weeks has suddenly seen corrections from three days. The event got triggered by Twitter CFO Mr Ned commenting that it no more looks safe to continue investing into crypto. During bull markets the prices increase and sometimes this adds instability till it finds the trigger and it seems that is what just happened. On the other side, the crypto markets are slowly growing big towards becoming immune from influencers,"" said Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin.

Meanwhile, dogecoin price plunged over 5% to $0.22 whereas Shiba Inu also crashed 10% to $0.000043. The performance of other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, XRP, Polkadot, Uniswap, Stellar, Cardano, Solana also were trading with cuts over the last 24 hours.

""In July, we publicly predicted that Bitcoin would reach and most likely beat it's previous all-time highs. I am confident that while there might be some profit-taking in the near-term, so that investors can accumulate more later, the momentum is such that we can expect prices to continue on their upward trajectory,"" he said recently.

The Indian market is expected to reach up to $241 million by 2030 in India and $2.3 billion by 2026 worldwide.

According to a report by the IT industry's apex body Nasscom, there are 15 million retail investors in India investing in the cryptotech space.

This was up by 1.56per cent over the course of the last day, crypto tracking CoinMarketCap data showed. The surge was attributed to the rising price in the crypto coins over the past few days. Shiba Inu prices continued a steady run for the second straight day on Friday, up by 3.95 per cent over the last 24 hours. One SHIB token was priced at $0.00005387 on the day amid an increasing demand among investors. However, Bitcoin, after touching a lifetime high on two days ago, slumped below the $65,000 mark on Friday. The coin, which was trading at over $67,000 earlier, was priced at $64,998.54 on the day, slightly up by 0.44 per cent over the last 24 hours.

“The cryptocurrency market remained under the influence of bears over the past 24 hours. Almost all of the top 20 cryptocurrencies ended in red, apart from the meme coin, Shiba Inu, which went higher driven by a huge buying pressure. We saw the total traded volumes across the spectrum rise by more than 21 per cent,” said Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex, on the fall in major crypto coins.

“Following a series of new highs in a short span of a week, bitcoin dipped slightly to US $64.9k and ethereum mirrored a similar trend, falling to US$4.7K. Through a week of highs and lows, questions of Bitcoin’s volatility and threats of the bubble bursting have re-emerged, threatening the growing credibility of the digital asset industry. Yet, proving critics wrong, analysts have calculated how Bitcoin instead has a deflationary effect, delivering 99.996 per cent deflation in the past decade,” said the CoinDCX Research Team.

Ethereum too came down from its all-time high of $4,800 on the day. One Ethereum altcoin was priced at $4,767.67 at the time of writing this article, up by 2.52 per cent in the last 24 hours. “Ethereum had corrected slightly after breaching the $4800 mark and making an All time high. ETH token continues to traverse along the ascending channel pattern. We could expect immediate support at $4430 level and the next resistance at the $4900 mark,” said the WazirX Trade Desk.

“Volumes however seem to show no respite, and we continue to see strong inflows across both these assets, and this is probably due to the fact that any correction from these levels makes both BTC and ETH look like attractive assets,” said the ZebPay Trade desk. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $126.46 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Pancake Games was the top gainer in the global crypto market, the data on CoinMarketCap showed. Over the last 24 hours, the value of one token increased by 1,841.44 per cent. One token was priced at $0.00002268, as per data. Angry Squid occupied the second spot in the top gainers’ pack, priced at $0.00000003704 and up by 1,201.65 per cent over the last 24 hours. Elonomics, valued at $34.98 per token, came third with a surge of 574.64 per cent in the last day.

As far as losers were concerned, the top spot went to LevelUp Gaming. The price of one token went down by 100.00 per cent and was trading at $0.009488 on Friday. StrongHands Finance and Tipsy Santa came second and third in the chart, decreasing by 86.28 and 81.67 per cent respectively during the course of the last day.

Redman Has Been An Active Member Of The Cryptocurrency Community Since He Has A Passion For Bitcoin', 'Open-Source Code', 'Decentralized Applications. Since September', 'Redman Has Written More Than Articles For Bitcoin.Com News About The Disruptive Protocols Emerging Today.']	"Crypto Markets Shed Billions Overnight — Analyst Says ‘Drawdown Normal’ and ‘Bull Market Structure Still Intact’

Cryptocurrency markets have dropped significantly in value during the last 24 hours as the entire market capitalization of all 10,000 crypto assets in existence has dropped below the $3 trillion mark to $2.77 trillion on Tuesday morning (EST). After tapping $66K on Monday, bitcoin’s price slid below the $60K handle to a low of $58,563 per unit. After the steep fall, bitcoin’s price has recovered some losses, rising back above the $60K range and has started to show some consolidation.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Top Cryptos See Double-Digit Losses in 24 Hours

Digital currencies are down in value on Tuesday as the market capitalization of the entire crypto-economy shed billions during the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 7.5% during the last day and has fallen 10.2% for the week.

At the time of writing, BTC is swapping for $60,563 per unit and has an overall market valuation of $1.14 trillion. BTC has $48 billion in 24-hour trade volume on Tuesday and 52.43% of those trades are paired with tether (USDT). This is followed by USD (18.75%), BUSD (6.61%), JPY (4.79%), EUR (4.45%), and KRW (2.70%).

Bitcoin’s drop from the $66K handle to just above $60K has also caused the myriad of alternative crypto asset markets to falter. Ethereum (ETH) has shed 9.2% during the overnight, and weekly stats show ether has lost 11.6%. While BTC has a dominance score of 41.5%, ethereum’s market is 18.3% of the entire crypto economy. Most digital currency markets suffered decent losses but coins like ecomi (OMI), nexo (NEXO), huobi token (HT), wonderland (TIME), and helium (HNT) have seen very little losses.

However, crypto assets like spell token (SPELL), kucoin token (KCS), near (NEAR), kadena (KDA), arweave (AR), dash (DASH), and zcash (ZEC) have lost between 15% to as high as 22.4% during the last day.

Ark36 Executive: ‘Drop Results in a Leverage Shakeout Which Contributes to a Healthier Market’

Meanwhile, as bitcoin, ethereum, and a slew of crypto markets suffer deep losses, the crypto assets hedge fund Ark36 executive Mikkel Morch told Bitcoin.com News that the drawdown is normal.

“Yet again, bitcoin has done what it does best – defy expectations,” Morch said. “After hitting an all-time high near the 69K level last week, the overall investor expectation was that the trend would immediately continue. Instead, we saw a largely sideways trend culminating in an almost 8% drop yesterday. Such a price decrease may seem disappointing or even concerning given the sweeping wave of enthusiasm the markets experienced just last week.” Morch continued:

However, it is vital to remember that an 8% drawdown is considered a normal market move in the crypto markets. At the moment, the overall bullish market structure remains largely intact. In fact, a sudden price drop results in a leverage shakeout which contributes to a healthier market that is better set up for an uptrend continuation in the medium term.

Huobi Global: Indicators Show ‘High Bearish Sentiment in the Market’

Bitcoin market fundamentals from Huobi Global indicate that there are many factors that show market sentiment is currently bearish. “All EMAs steeply downward, Bollinger band opening significantly expanded, the current indicators are indicating a high bearish sentiment in the market,” Huobi Global told Bitcoin.com News on Tuesday morning. “From the daily level, BTC is now in a long negative line, the short-term uptrend has broken, daily volume is enlarged, the short-term trend may continue to move downward, pay attention to the support below,” Huobi added.

In a similar market outlook report, Huobi noted that ethereum (ETH) market signals also indicate a “high bearish sentiment in the market.” ETH/USD chart indicators using a 4-hour time frame show EMAs and the K-line are all running downhill. “From a daily perspective, the upside channel of ETH may be broken, and this retracement falls below the short-term support level, and the follow-up continues to look for whether there is effective support below,” Huobi Global’s bitcoin and ethereum market outlook concluded.

As A Crypto-Journalist', 'His Interests Lie In Blockchain Technology Adoption Across Emerging Economies.']	"The cryptocurrency market registered a sharp correction earlier today where the top-10 cryptocurrencies lost 7-10% of their market cap within minutes. The market correction led to nearly $300 billion getting whipped off the crypto market as its valuation fell from $3 trillion to $2.65 trillion at the time of writing. This is the second flash crash in two weeks despite many market pundits predicting November to be a bullish month.

Bitcoin (BTC) wiped off the majority of its gains from November as the price of the top cryptocurrency fell to near $60K. The top cryptocurrency was trading above $66K in the morning before recording a weekly low of $60,583. As visible on the monthly candle, the market sell-off has turned it red from green.

Apart from BTC major altcoins including Ether registered a steeper decline in price as ETH fell to a daily low of $4,271. However, ETH’s monthly chart still has a green candle thanks to its mammoth rise this month, rising from just under $4K to set several new ATHs.

Apart from the stablecoins, the majority of the volatile crypto market bled in red and wiped off major gains from the month of November. Nearly $500 million worth of leveraged positions also got liquidated.

Did Passing of $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill Lead to the Market Wipe-Off?

The traditional financial market is suffering due to high inflation caused by overprinting by the feds, but governments continue to print more money to restrict the damages caused by the printing of money. Many believe the sudden decline in the crypto market came because of the approval of the controversial infrastructure bill that turned into law earlier today.

The crypto taxation part in particular divided the senate at the time of discussion, where those who are not well versed with a decentralized market called for a total surveillance system and impossible tax reporting demands, while a few Republican senators opposed it tooth and nail and suggested for a more inclusive law."

His Work Can Be Found In Numerous Magazines In Australia On Topics Ranging Culture To Science. Lachlan Holds A Bachelor S Degree In Journalism Macleay College In Australia.']	"The crypto market was rocked this morning Asia time as news that indebted Chinese property giant Evergrande may default on a US$148 million bond payment sent prices dropping around 5% across the board. Prices stabilized throughout the day, however, after the firm was able to make the payment at the last moment as the grace period deadline expired yesterday. With the company around US$300 billion in debt, there are concerns over the effect the company defaulting would have on global markets, both crypto and otherwise.

The price drop-off comes after days of strong price action among many leading tokens. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, both reached new all-time highs within hours of each other overnight before each losing more than 5% coming into business hours this morning, according to data from CoinGecko. Both following very similar price movements, Bitcoin reached US$69,044 just after midnight with Ethereum reaching a new level of US$4,878 shortly after.

This is not the first time concerns over Evergrande’s future have caused global markets to falter. In September a similar scare saw crypto markets losing around 9% as the company debt woes made headlines around the world, with the threat of its collapse, eliciting comparisons to the Lehman Brothers downfall that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008. The fallout from the pending default was not as acute this time around, but one market analyst told Forkast.News the company’s troubles are far from over.

“Every time [Evergrande] makes a payment, the clock starts ticking down for the next one, and I think the market’s very much aware that it’s always going to try and use that grace period [on its loans],” said Andrew Sullivan, founder and writer for Asianmarketsense.com. “It doesn’t have enough money to pay for everything on time, so it’s having to play swings and roundabouts, taking money from the left pocket to the right pocket … in order to pay different suppliers, different bondholders.”

With the exception of stablecoins, no tokens in the top 10 by market cap were spared the downturn, though some were more affected than others. Binance Coin, in third position, which had been making a run up on its all-time high it set back in May, had been trading at its highest point since that time before dropping 10% this morning. It has since recovered and was trading at US$630 at press time, according to CoinGecko.

Fifth-place Solana set its own all-time high of US$259 over the weekend in the leadup to the network’s first major global conference, Breakpoint, which was held in Lisbon earlier this week. Among the major developments announced at the conference was a US$100 million partnership with the venture firm of Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social media site Reddit, to invest in decentralized social media platforms to be built on the network. Solana saw a 7% decline in the two hours before trading this morning, but has recovered swiftly and was trading back near its mid-week high at US$246 as of press time, according to CoinGecko.

After sitting in third position for much of the past few months in the leadup to its long-awaited Alonzo upgrade, which was to bring smart contract capabilities to the network, Cardano has been in slow decline since early September. An impressive price run earlier in the week seemed to suggest a change in fortunes for the network, gaining 20% in a matter of days to reach a one-month high of US$2.36. Its price retreated from this point quickly, however, and with the 9% drop off this morning, most of the gains of the past week were erased. It was trading at US$2.15 at press time, according to CoinGecko.

While the company — like the global economy — is not out of the woods yet, today’s payment has bought Evergrande some time, with the next major payment not being due until early 2022. Nonetheless, the company is still rife with liquidity issues and has had to resort to extreme measures to get money together. Company employees have been told they must give the firm short-term loans if they wish to receive their bonuses, and company founder and chairman Xu Jiayin put a luxury house in Hong Kong he owns as loan collateral at the request of company creditors.

Speculation abounds as to whether the Chinese government would allow Evergrande to fail, or would step in to save the company, though Sullivan does not believe that it would, instead that it may attempt to apply subtle pressure to other developers to help the flailing behemoth out. Evergrande’s competitors may be disinterested in stepping in as many of the company’s projects are already pre-sold, and so would yield little capital in return. While this has been done in the past, it was while the markets were much healthier, and Sullivan speculates some competitors may be holding off on buying any assets until the prices come down even further.

The real estate market has had enormous economic and cultural value to the world’s most populous nation, and if it were to collapse it would be disastrous for the country and its people. “People in China view property to a large extent as their bank, this is their pension,” Sullivan said, explaining as the housing market was slowing down, the Chinese government was trying to shift the economy towards the production of high-end technological goods, such as semiconductors.

China has taken a progressively hard-line approach to cryptocurrency this year starting with a crackdown on mining throughout the country before putting a blanket ban of all cryptocurrency-related transactions in September due to the government’s belief crypto is disrupting the economic and financial order.

Sullivan said the strong market action recently could have raised tensions with would-be investors within the country, but the government has taken advantage of the current moment to smooth over the cryptocurrency issue — among others.

“People are naturally going to be resentful of the fact that they’ve been banned from that market,” Sullivan said. “How much they can do about it, how much that’s going to sway the government [it’s] difficult to say. The thing about Covid is that it’s allowing [the government] to be very, very draconian, to close China down, to make sure people aren’t aware of what’s going on outside so much as they would have before. So that suits [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping].”"

NEW YORK (AP) — The cryptocurrency market gets likened to the Wild West by critics, and now a key player is asking for sheriffs to come to town.

Binance, the world’s largest exchange for trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, says it’s time for global regulators to establish rules for crypto markets. It released a list of “10 fundamental rights for crypto users” this week that it wants to guide discussions with regulators, policymakers and other exchanges.

The company acknowledges that crypto platforms have an obligation to protect users and to implement processes to prevent financial crimes, along with the responsibility to work with regulators and policymakers to set standards to keep users safe.

The call for regulation might seem strange for an industry whose popularity exploded in some part precisely because it sought to operate outside the heavy hand of governments and other authorities. But Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao , who goes by “CZ,” says more regulation for the industry is inevitable, and this allows his company to play a role in the discussions. It may also help draw in people who are still hesitant to get into crypto.

“This year, most of the regulators around the world are looking at crypto intently, and many of them are communicating with us,” Zhao said. “So we feel this is the right time” to issue a call for a global framework.

“We feel that it is important for industry players to have a seat at the table,” he said. “And we also feel that some regulations, if they’re made in a vacuum, may not have practical considerations in how they are applied, and they don’t get applied very well.”

Regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies has intensified as they’ve grown more mainstream. Big businesses, professional investors and even the government of El Salvador are all buying in, even if critics struggle to see the value of digital currencies created by non-governments. They’re broadening crypto’s base beyond its initial core of fanatics and sent Bitcoin last week to a record high of nearly $68,991, more than doubling in 2021.

Binance’s call for regulation reminds some on Wall Street of the playbook that companies have followed in other disruptive industries after becoming big winners.

“They’re doing what Uber and Lyft did,” said Gil Luria, technology strategist at D.A. Davidson. “Build a business ahead of regulations. When it gets to a certain scale, acknowledge that regulation will be helpful and then help shape it.”

Zhao said that Binance welcomes regulations “for many reasons. One of those minor reasons is a selfish reason: that in a regulated industry, the few larger players will remain. The smaller players do get cut off, which is unfortunate for those guys.”

The move could also prove to be wise if Binance’s U.S. business ultimately tries to sell stock on a U.S. exchange, something Zhao hopes will happen in the next few years. A competitor, Coinbase, has already fetched a nearly $74 billion market value on Wall Street following its initial public offering this spring.

Such opportunities for wealth have drawn more new investors into crypto, as well as the eyes of regulators.

“Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto,” Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a speech this summer while calling it the “Wild West.”

“This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications,” he said. “There’s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information.”

Analysts said they expect Binance to agree to report transactions to U.S. regulators looking for movements involved in the financing of terrorism, among other things. One of Binance’s “fundamental rights” also calls for strict regulations on marketplaces that offer “derivatives and leveraged instruments,” which can be lucrative but also very risky trades for investors.

Most regulators around the world are focusing on “know your customer” rules, where financial companies try to verify the identity of who’s using their services, Zhao said. They’re also keyed in on protections for consumers.

But even there, “different countries do have different interpretations and different meanings for these very simple words,” Zhao said. In the U.S., for example, the emphasis for anti-money laundering is on blocking financing for terrorism, while Chinese regulators are looking more for people moving money out of the country.

Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University who recently wrote a book titled “DeFi and the Future of Finance,” said regulators are playing catch-up with complicated and fast-moving technologies, while trying to find a balance between protecting investors and not squashing innovation or driving it to other countries.

The stakes are rising to get it right. The uncertainty now around what regulation will eventually look like is keeping some big institutional investors like pension funds out of crypto. And that’s where the opportunity for even bigger money for the industry lies.

Given all the complexities, Harvey said the best solution may be for the U.S. government to create a new agency to oversee cryptocurrencies and the ecosystem around them, rather than relying on a combination of regulatory bodies.

“It’s complex, and it just doesn’t fit many of the usual regulatory models,” he said.

Zhao, who said the only cryptocurrencies he owns are Bitcoin and Binance coin, said some parts of the cryptocurrency world look more like securities, while others look more like commodities or currencies. And the ecosystem is growing by the day as people can create new tokens with just a few clicks of a mouse and keyboard.

He likened it to the early days of the internet, when people were trying to figure out what kind of media it was. Is it radio? TV? Something else?

“People may have a tendency to view crypto as a single asset, which I think is a little bit misleading,” he said. “Crypto is a fundamental technology that can improve on many of the traditional asset types.”"
2021-11-17 00:00:00+00:00	Bitcoin and other cryptos have slumped after record highs. Is market manipulation the reason why?	['David Gerard', 'Author Of The Book Attack Of The Foot Blockchain']	"By Pascale Davies

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply after seeing record-highs just last week.

Bitcoin’s price plunged to $58,400 (€51,000) on Tuesday and hovered just under the $60,000 (€53,000) threshold on Wednesday as the crypto market is again becoming a sea of red.

It marks a 12 per cent drop from the record high of $69,000 (€61,000) set on November 10.

The second-largest crypto Ether meanwhile plunged more than 14 per cent since its record last week to reach $4,244 (€3,7500).

The reasons why cryptos have been so volatile of late is unclear but there are a number of factors at play.

The basic thing that happened was the Bitcoin price, we know it's highly manipulated because this is an unregulated pool for sharks. David Gerard Author of the book Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain

One reason may be due to market manipulation, argues David Gerard, the author of the book Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain. And it is all to do with Tether, a blockchain-based cryptocurrency whose tokens are backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars.

Tether pumping up prices

""Tethers are supposed to be all backed by dollars. There's a lot of reasons like settlements with the authorities that suggest this has not been the case in the past, and we shouldn't presume it's the case now,"" Gerard told Euronews Next.

""So it looks like three billion Tethers, backed by nothing, were used to pump the Bitcoin price up at this particular time.

""When they stopped, the Bitcoin price dropped. That's basically the story of the shenanigans that went on in the last week or two"".

Gerard argues this kind of market manipulation and fake liquidity happens all the time.

""The basic thing that happened was the Bitcoin price, we know it's highly manipulated because this is an unregulated pool for sharks,"" he said.

""I think some fake liquidity was deployed. About $3 billion (€2.6 million) worth of questionable liquidity was deployed, which was used to pump the price up.

""That's the sort of manipulation that goes on in the Bitcoin markets all the time,"" Gerard added.

""Normal people look at this stuff (the crypto market) and think, 'Oh, that's a good market,' but they're the meat, they're the suckers, and the money comes from.

""This is a big boys game. And you'd better be prepared to be eaten alive,"" Gerard warned.

Stockpiling Bitcoin

The other reason for the crypto price slide is the continued fallout from China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining, which led to an exodus of miners to the US and Canada.

China’s National Development and Reform Commission said on Tuesday it would continue to regulate crypto mining due to concerns over the amount of energy being used.

Gerard points out it is not just because of mining regulation that crypto prices have slumped. He argues those exiled miners have a billion dollars of Bitcoins that they are keeping as stockpiles and not selling them.

""No one can really account for this because Bitcoin miners have never behaved like that, except when they can't sell the coins because there aren't enough people with dollars to buy them.

""I think what's happening there is that all the dumb retail dollars have gone home and the markets are very thin at the moment, and that's why they're having to inflate them in artificial ways,"" said Gerard.

Cryptos may also have been affected by comments by Twitter’s Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal on Monday. He said investing in crypto “does not make sense right now”.

""We (would) have to change our investment policy and choose to own assets that are more volatile,"" Segal said.

But the hype around cryptocurrencies and blockchain has not dwindled. On Tuesday, the Staples Center in Los Angeles said it would be renamed the Crypto.com Arena, making it reportedly one of the biggest naming rights deals in history."

Flows surge as momentum runs hot

NEW YORK/SYDNEY, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Bitcoin and ether hit record peaks on Tuesday, with enthusiasm for cryptocurrency adoption and worry about inflation driving momentum and flows into the asset class.

Though both virtual currencies pulled back from their highs in the U.S. session, their trajectory was clearly headed higher.

Bitcoin rose as high as $68,564.40 and was last down 0.1% at $67,325 while ether , the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, earlier hit $4,842.65 before trading down 0.7% at $4,774.

Both have more than doubled since June and added nearly 70% against the dollar since the start of October.

""This move is a culmination of months of net outflows from exchanges and coming off the market, coupled with increasing demand,"" said Martha Reyes, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange BEQUANT.

""This creates a supply shock and we are far from levels where long-term holders, who make up a greater number of investors, start taking significant profits so $100,000 is on the horizon,"" she added.

Market momentum has been gathering since last month's launch of a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the United States raised expectations of flow-driven gains. read more

Inflows into bitcoin products and funds have hit a record $6.4 billion so far this year, data from digital asset manager CoinShares showed, and totaled $95 million last week. read more

Huge pandemic savings and a more upbeat global growth prospects suggested that digital assets would remain well-supported, analysts said.

'WHERE THE FAST MONEY IS'

Other pieces of positive news have also helped, including plans by Grayscale, the world's largest digital currency manager, to convert its flagship bitcoin trust (GBTC.PK) into a spot-bitcoin exchange traded fund. Last week Grayscale also applied to list a ""future of finance"" fund that would track companies involved in the growing digital economy.

""Crypto is where the fast money is at,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone. ""(Ether) is trending like a dream and I'd be long and strong here,"" he added.

""Clients are net long, with 79% of open positions held long, and I can sense the $5k party could get going soon.""

Others though flagged cause for some near-term caution on bitcoin, however, as the cost of funding long positions has crept higher in recent days, according to trading platform BitMEX - sometimes a precursor to a pullback.

Still, the moves so far have carried the token more than 1,680% higher from its March 2020 lows and helped lift the total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies above $3 trillion, according to crypto price and data aggregator CoinGecko.

CoinMarketCap put it slightly lower at $2.93 trillion. Either way true believers, or ""hodlers"" in crypto markets terminology, have felt vindicated and remain bullish.

""They threw everything at the beast and still it moves,"" said payments strategist and sometimes host of the Around the Coin podcast, Brian Roemmele, on Twitter. ""Next stop: #Bitcoin $72000.""

2021-11-18 00:00:00+00:00	Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon All Dropped Today	['Chris Macdonald']	"What happened

Volatility in the crypto market has continued to take bearish form today. Leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC 2.53%), Ethereum (ETH 4.49%), and Polygon (MATIC 4.75%) all saw significant drops in early trading today. As of 1:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin and Ethereum both traded slightly more than 4% lower, with Polygon down around 8.5% over the past 24 hours.

It appears much of this move is a continuation of what we've seen this week in terms of price action across most major cryptocurrencies. Among the most prominent bearish catalysts is the move earlier this week from Chinese regulators to clamp down harder on Bitcoin mining. As a cryptocurrency that's often used as a benchmark for the valuations of the sector, this Bitcoin-related news had ripple effects for most large-cap crypto tokens.

So what

Given the fact that these three cryptocurrencies combined make up more than half the market capitalization of the entire crypto world, investors pay attention to these kinds of moves. Additionally, the fact that this bearish momentum has continued for several trading days now suggests a more protracted move could be underway.

While risk assets remain red-hot right now, some investors are growing concerned with the pace of valuation expansion across various asset classes. Cryptocurrencies happen to be difficult to intrinsically value. Accordingly, negative headlines appear to be driving token prices down, as investors increasingly focus on the risks associated with this sector, rather than its growth potential.

Now what

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon are three blockchain networks creating a tremendous amount of utility right now. For long-term investors in the crypto space, there's a lot to like about the long-term potential of these blockchains in terms of disruption and innovation moving forward.

However, there's also something to be said about the risk and volatility associated with the cryptocurrency space as a whole. Investors putting any sort of meaningful capital into this sector ought to be aware of the downside risks. Investors have seen the high-reward aspect of many cryptocurrencies in recent months. However, this week's price action is the latest reminder that these digital assets are extremely volatile, and therefore high-risk in nature."
2021-11-08 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptocurrency market value zooms past $3,000,000,000,000	['Anugraha Sundaravelu']	"Ethereum hit a new all-time high of $4770 on Monday (Getty)

The value of the cryptocurrency market has risen over $3 trillion for the first time.

In what has been a positive week for cryptocurrencies, Ether reached its highest ever price on Monday as Bitcoin continued to race upwards.

Ethereum hit a new all-time high of $4770 (£3518.42) on Monday, while Bitcoin brushed close to October’s record of almost $67000 (£49414.84) according to CoinGecko.

The crypto market as a whole was up 4.7%, according to the tracking website CoinMarketCap. There was reportedly a 15% increase in trading volumes over the day.

Ether’s record high was due to a higher burn rate of tokens and a fresh burst of new money flowing into the market. This was what lifted Bitcoin towards its recent all-time high.

The surge has also been driven by a range of market developments such as the launch of an Ether-backed exchange traded fund, as well worries about inflation.

Bloomberg analysts predicted last week that the first Ethereum futures-based exchange traded fund could launch in the first quarter of 2022.

Ether is the second biggest coin by market cap after Bitcoin. Over the course of the month, it rose by 36%, thanks to the growing popularity of applications such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the development of the metaverse, while Bitcoin rose by 24%.

The market has seen an influx of new buyers coming into the space. Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges, was the most downloaded app in the US last week.

Avalanche, Dogecoin, and XRP rank among the top gainers, increasing by over 7.5% market value in the past 24 hours.

The Shiba Inu coin posted losses over the day. (Getty)

The meme currency Dogecoin went up 13% on Monday and is now worth $38 million.

However, not all coins experienced gains. Popular cryptocurrencies such as Solana and the Shiba Inu coin posted losses over the day.

All of the seven biggest coins are up over the past week. Binance Coin and Solana, the third and fourth-biggest tokens respectively, have added more than 20% in the past week.

The market for digital assets is a little over a decade old but it has already quadrupled from its 2020 year-end value. Investors have gotten more comfortable with established tokens such as Bitcoin and networks like Ethereum and Solana continue to attract new functionality.

The possibilities of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens are steadily rising while memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to make headlines.

The volatile nature of crypto signals caution as the last time Bitcoin reached these levels, it fell back several thousand dollars. Other coins are even more volatile with memecoins being especially unpredictable.

The market also sees frequent scams and hacks with one of the biggest happening last week over the Squid Game token inspired by the Netflix show.

Analysts say this latest raly is just the beginning (Getty)

The US trading debut of a Bitcoin-linked ETF as well as Elon Musk’s weekend Twitter poll has contributed to Bitcoin’s surge. Facebook’s rebranding to Meta has also driven the popularity of altcoins.

Bitcoin’s price was stuck between $60,000 and $63,600 since Oct. 21 but with the current momentum, it might be headed to new all-time highs.

Crypto experts are expecting an event known as ‘the flippening’ in the coming months. This will happen when Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in terms of total market size.

Analysts say this latest rally is just the beginning for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

2021-11-16 02:30:47+00:00	Here’s how crypto-market’s 24/7 trading is setting an example	['Anjali Jain']	"The past couple of years have witnessed the continued growth of institutional investments flowing into the cryptocurrency market. It includes not only hedge funds and family offices but even pension funds and conservative custody banks parking their funds here. Naturally, this has led to the entangling of traditional and crypto finance, with the latter having profound effects on stock and currency markets.

These include the trading times that these markets follow. While cryptocurrency exchanges operate non-stop, traditional exchanges operate only during specific days and time frames. This could change in the future, however, as trading platforms such as 24 Exchange are working towards making stocks tradable 365 days a week in the US on the back of consumer demand.

In a report by the Financial Times, 24 Exchange’s chief executive Dmitri Galinov was quoted as saying,

“Once cryptocurrency trading [became mainstream], people became very accustomed to its unlimited availability, so I believe they will expect such 24/7 trading availability for other assets. Customers are already asking: why can I trade Bitcoin but not Tesla after market hours or on a weekend?”

Galinov believes that large investors too would now want to trade on the weekends and after-hours replicating the cryptocurrency market, as it could possibly offer them more chances of changing positions.

Forex markets to make the change?

While stock markets may not be ready as yet to make this move, foreign exchange markets could transition sooner as they directly affect the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be traded by retail investors on cryptocurrency exchanges throughout the weekend, even while foreign exchange trading is closed.

This exposes cryptocurrencies to the risk of price differentiation due to large market moves when the forex markets open, according to David Warner, who is the CEO of LMAX Group. While speaking to FT, he said,

“Friday night prices that brokers are offering . . . don’t reflect the reality of the market. As cryptocurrency markets gain momentum, and there is increasing convergence with forex, crypto will continue pushing traditional asset classes to innovate.”

On the flip side, the need for nonstop trading in traditional markets might not be profound. This is because stock and currencies don’t suffer from same price volatility as crypto assets and hence rarely require immediate attention to positions.

Moreover, a recent report by digital infrastructure provider Copper found something very interesting. Majority of trading in cryptocurrency exchanges occurred during weekdays and market hours, with only 35% taking place during weekends and after hours. However, it also found that historically, there has been a 61% chance that markets close higher in overnight trading, up from under 50% in 2018.

In the end, the growing influence of the cryptocurrency market and its brokers could lead to large banks relenting to their demands for an extension in trading hours for currencies. According to Chi Nzleu, who is the head of macro ecommerce at JPMorgan, such a scenario could play out in the future f digital exchanges continue to grow. He said,

“Demand is currently limited in the institutional space,” he observes. “We always stay close to clients so we can adapt as trading habits and preferences change, though.”"
2021-11-18 09:47:31+00:00	When will Crypto market recover after recent crash or drop will continue?	['Ashish Kumar']	"Advertisement

New Delhi: The cryptocurrency market witnessed a sharp crash on Tuesday as Bitcoin plunged below $60,000 and Etherium to its lowest levels this month. Major altcoins like Binance’s BNB, Solana, Cardano, and Ripple’s XRP also dipped around 7% to 10% of their value.

As per reports, the sudden crypto crash wiped almost $400 billion from the combined crypto market which recently touched a record high of $3 trillion.

The technical indicators were suggesting the continuous strong bull run in the volatile market but this sudden crash has shocked the investors.

But Bulls could not seize the market and all the top coins witnessed a continuous fall.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin on Wednesday saw consolidation in sideways range as the bears managed to break the psychological support level which took BTC on a downward ride towards November low at $58,563.

Later in the day, Buyers tried to bring back the momentum and test the upper price level but it again dropped down to the monthly low zone. As per experts, after some recovery, investors can hope to build strong support at $58,000. With the dominance of bears, sellers can take this price down towards the $55,287 price level.

Etherium

Bears have been successful to break the $4,300 support several times, marking a lowest around the $4,110 mark.

Later in the day, Buyers tried to bring back the momentum and tried to restore the price above the support of $4,300 but the selling pressure intensified. The ETH went on to touch $4,065.

As per experts, bears can retest the psychological support of $4,000 and there is also a chance to see a restest of the $3,800 support level.

Cardano

ADA/Cardano can be termed as the biggest loser among the top cryptos. ADA went on to touch the support at $1.832 and bounced off which indicates that bulls are still in the control. As per experts, selling pressure is high and rising, which symbols that it may break out to lead to a major drop to touch $1.50."

Daily Crypto News Nov 29, 2021

Bitcoin and mainstream altcoins have been struggling hard to recover from the sharp fall that was seen on November 26. This is evident of the fact that traders are nervous to buy at the current levels due to uncertainty. This uncertainty is majorly due to the heavily mutated coronavirus strain detected in South Africa. CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky is unfazed with these recent price corrections and viewed this fall as a buying opportunity for many. He revealed that he invested around $10 million into Bitcoin and Ether at the current levels on November 28. He also expects Bitcoin to rally to $70,000.

Experts believe that if Bitcoin breaks through the current levels selected altcoins will also attract many investors’ attention. According to crypto analysts, the top 5 cryptocurrencies to look out for in the next week are Bitcoin (BTC), Binance coin (BNB), Terra (LUNA), Decentraland (MANA), and Sandbox (SAND).

Anthony Scaramucci a renowned Hedge fund manager was found comparing Bitcoin (BTC) to the e-commerce giant Amazon in its early days. He drew a comparison of Bitcoin being volatile just how Amazon stock prices were volatile in their early days but later became the best-performing stocks.

Bitcoin has shown exponential growth in terms of fundamentals in the previous year and the recent price corrections are a good opportunity for the investors to enter, says SKyBridge capital’s founder. This correction serves as an opportunity for investors to buy Bitcoin at a discount. Although Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin has still not become an asset that can be used to hedge against inflation but he is bullish on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency.

2021-11-09 12:30:18+00:00	Cryptocurrency Market Cap Breaks $3 Trillion for the First Time	['Read More', 'About Scn Team']	"CoinGecko has recently reported that the total cryptocurrency market cap has broken its previous all-time high of $2.62 trillion and went up by another 14.5% in less than three weeks.

Now, it is estimated to be sitting above $3 trillion for the first time ever — with 10,418 digital assets across 518 cryptocurrency exchanges taken into account.

The total crypto market cap had nearly peaked $2.62 trillion on May 12, 2021 prior to bouncing off a local low of $1.24 trillion on July 20.

Although Bitcoin’s bull run has been rather impressive for the past two years, it has started to its footing as the top performing asset in the crypto market considerably since September 6, 2019 — having fallen by 42.8%.

As for Ether — the rivalling digital asset of Bitcoin — the Ethereum ecosystem currently dominates around 27.6% of the crypto market, or has a market cap of $829 billion.

Bitcoin may still be ahead of the race with a market share of $1.22 trillion, in comparison to Ether’s $560 billion. That being said, the $1.24 trillion aggregate market cap of all other digital assets is giving Bitcoin a run for its money as well."

2021-11-19 10:00:00+00:00	Why is crypto down today? Bitcoin price crash explained and latest value after it fell more than $6,000	['Alex Finnis']	"Billions were wiped from the cryptocurrency market after Bitcoin and other major coins crashed on Monday night.

Bitcoin’s value sunk back below $60,000, having reached an all-time high of around $69,000 on 10 November.

Most coins recovered slightly after the crash, bit dipped again on Thursday. As of Friday morning Bitcoin was valued at around $56,800.

Most major coins have lost around 17 per cent of their value since last week’s highs.

Ethereum is now at around $4,100, while Solana, Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu suffered similar losses.

Why did the crypto market crash?

A number of factors have likely contributed to the crash.

A major one is the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejecting a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would likely have seen billions poured into the crypto market.

China has also ramped up its clampdown on Bitcoin mining, which helped cause the last crash earlier this year.

China’s National Development and Reform Commission said on Tuesday that it would consider “punitive electricity prices” for some crypto mines in the next stage of its crackdown.

The dollar has been strengthening against other fiat currencies this week, but also appears to be strengthening against crypto.

This is in part because interest rates are rising, which can drive down inflation.

Twitter’s CFO Ned Segal also made negative comments about cryptocurrency, which may have helped sway the market.

He said investing cash into crypto assets “doesn’t make sense” right now.

Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk that Bitcoin could continue to lose value.

“We have noticed some larger sales occur on Bitfinex as well as openings of new short positions,” he said.

“While liquidations so far are quite low by historical standard and funding rates are approaching flat, we could see a further cool-off in BTC for the short term as momentum is beginning to stall.”

Should I invest in cryptocurrency?

People invest at their own risk and cryptocurrencies are not regulated by British financial authorities.

All crypto investments are risky, but meme coins like Shiba Inu are particularly volatile, and you should be prepared to lose everything you invest.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned in January: “Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money.

“If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money.”

Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown previously explained the risks to i.

She said: “On top of being extremely volatile, most cryptocurrencies are unregulated, which not only adds another layer of uncertainty but also means that investors have little or no protection against fraud.”"

It is worth noting that cryptocurrency does not physically exist, meaning that you can’t pick up a Bitcoin and hold it in your hand. And unlike the Indian Rupee, there is no central authority that maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. Instead, these tasks are broadly distributed among a cryptocurrency’s users via the internet.

Further, each coin of cryptocurrency consists of a unique line of program or code. This means that it can’t be copied, which makes them easy to track and identify as they’re traded.

How does it work?

Cryptocurrencies are not backed by a central authority such as a government. Instead, they run across a chain of computers. It is exchanged from peer-to-peer on the web without a middleman.

Cryptocurrencies are decentralised—which means no government or bank manages how they’re made, what their value is, or how they will be exchanged. All the crypto transactions are secured by cryptography—meaning that it only allows the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents.

Is cryptocurrency similar to Blockchain?

No. Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency. A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is distributed across the entire network of computer systems. Think of it like a ledger that shows the entire history of that piece of currency.

To put it simply, it is a system of recording information that makes it impossible to hack the system. Each block in the blockchain contains several transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on it, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger.

A blockchain database can store a large quantity of information that can be utilised and accessed by many users at the same time.

But what makes Blockchain unique is that it is not owned by a single person or entity— making it more secure and trustworthy. The idea is that because no one controls the blockchain, they cannot take over and rewrite the records.

How can you store your cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency can be stored in something called a ‘wallet’, which can be accessed by using your ‘private key’—the crypto equivalent of a super-secure password— without which the crypto owner cannot access the currency.

A crypto wallet stores the private keys that give the user access to their cryptocurrencies—allowing one to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It should be noted that your coins are stored on the blockchain, and the private key is required to authorise transfers of those coins to another person’s wallet.

There are different types of crypto wallets available that cater to different requirements in terms of security, reliability, accessibility, etc.

What types of cryptocurrency exist?

Bitcoin is the topmost traded cryptocurrency that everyone knows and talks about, but it’s not the only kind of cryptocurrency out there. There’s Litecoin, Polkadot, Chainlink, Mooncoin, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, etc. Currently, there are more than 6,000 coins in existence, as per CoinMarket cap.

Bitcoin is the most stable coin. As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin traded below one dollar. Over the years, Bitcoin picked up a price momentum and has exceeded the market cap of $1 trillion. Meanwhile, investors should explore their options and choose the asset that could best serve their needs.

How to buy cryptocurrency?

Just like the stock market, the crypto market has exchanges or brokers which are the facilitators. These exchanges often charge a fee or commission for each transaction. Some even give rewards for hitting a milestone, some give them as a joining bonus. This policy may differ with each exchange.

Some of the top crypto exchanges in India are — WazirX, CoinDCX, Coinswitch Kuber and Unocoin—users have to sign up with their KYC credentials, download the app, and buy cryptocurrency. These exchanges also help you to monitor the value of cryptocurrency and buy or sell it.

Crypto exchanges rely on investors for the possession of cryptocurrency. This happens when users deposit crypto to sell and some new users come to the exchange to buy it—thereby, facilitating trading.

Cryptocurrency can be purchased fractionally. For instance, if you’re willing to buy a Bitcoin you don’t need to buy a full Bitcoin (BTC) to own some. You can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. You can own as little as 0.00000001 BTC. This is the case with all cryptocurrencies.

Can you get cryptocurrency for free?

Yes, you don’t have to buy a cryptocurrency to own one. You can also gain cryptocurrency by solving cryptographic equations through the use of computers. This process involves validating data blocks and adding transaction records to the blockchain.

It is also worth noting that some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are finite in supply, meaning that there is a maximum number of coins that will ever be in circulation. Others like Ethereum do not have a maximum cap but limit the number of new coins that can be generated each year.

What can you buy with cryptocurrency?

India is slowly opening up to the idea of accepting it as a legitimate payment method. There are some practical issues with cryptocurrency— as it cannot be exactly used for daily transactions. However, there are ways to use your crypto to facilitate payments.

Unocoin, a Bitcoin trading site, is now allowing its users to buy vouchers from over 90 different brands using Bitcoins. Using these vouchers, you can buy Domino’s pizza, ice cream from Baskin Robbins, beauty and health products from Himalaya, and even home appliances from Prestige.

In the US, retailers like Whole Foods, Nordstrom, Etsy, Expedia, and PayPal are now letting people pay using crypto.

How stable are cryptocurrencies?

In January this year, Bitcoin skyrocketed to $40,000 (roughly ₹ 29.70 lakh). Continuing its bull run, it reached an all-time high of $65,000 (roughly ₹ 48.27 lakh) towards the end of April. Then in May, it plunged and throughout June it remained below $30,000 (roughly ₹ 22.28 lakh). Again the prices have skyrocketed, and at the time of writing this article, the price of Bitcoin is Rs 51 lakhs approx.

This shows that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. The cryptocurrency market thrives on speculation. Investors place speculative bets that cause a sudden influx of money or a sudden outgo, leading to high volatility.

Additionally, the crypto market is seen as a way to earn quick profits. Part-timers come with a hope of making quick gains but sometimes when that does not happen, they lose patience and withdraw from it. This recurring involvement and withdrawal contribute to the volatility of digital coins.

Is it a legal tender in India?

At the moment, there is no legislature that covers cryptocurrencies in India. But this doesn’t mean that owning cryptocurrencies is illegal.

Meanwhile, India is yet to table the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which will lay down the regulatory framework for the launch of an “official digital currency”, it was to be introduced in Parliament’s Budget session, but was held up as the government continues discussions with stakeholders. So far, only a few countries have accepted cryptocurrencies as legal tender and the list is expected to remain small.

2021-11-12 13:59:00+00:00	Flush with cash, crypto market makers are the new places to be	[]	"Forget hedge funds. Maybe even forget working for established electronic market makers like Jane Street and Citadel Securities. In the new world order, it's all about working for a crypto market making firm.

As crypto and decentralized finance take off, headhunters say crypto market making firms are adding top people from across the market and hedge funds are being left in the dust. ""Hedge funds, who gives a f*ck about hedge funds,"" says one former FX professional working in the area. ""It's the crypto market making firms that matter. The hedge funds are all five years behind.""

The crypto market-making ecosystem is diffuse, with different players in different markets. In London, Wintermute Trading is big, and B2C2 is growing, as is Enigma Securities. Globally, the leading players include GSR (hiring across the US, London and Singapore), Kraken, or Kairon Labs (based in Belgium), among others. Most are recruiting. The jobs can be very lucrative indeed.

""Nearly all these crypto market making firms have big pools of cash,"" says one headhunter in the area, talking on condition of anonymity. ""They pay at least twice a year, and often monthly.""

London-based B2C2 was founded by Maxime Boonen, a former associate swaps trader at Goldman Sachs, who left to set up the firm in 2015. It's just moved into a new London office and has hired 64 people this year, more than doubling the 56 employees it had 12 months ago. Many of its new hires have histories in investment banks, including Kento Yamazaki, a former OTC derivatives analyst at JPMorgan, who joined in Tokyo; or Tom Durrant, a former Morgan Stanley salesperson, Fenni Kang, a former Barclays quant trader, or Sukvinder Banwait, a former middle office analyst at Goldman Sachs - all of whom joined in London.

The crypto market makers also have a tendency to hire from systematic hedge funds, or electronic trading firms like Optiver. Wintermute hired Adam Roberts from GAM systematic in June. Enigma Securities hired Roy Tse, its U.S. COO from Waterfall Asset Management in April.

Historically, Mike Burton, a crypto headhunter at search firm Figtree, says plenty of the people joining the crypto market makers had no finance experience at all. ""The vast majority of crypto traders at this stage have evolved in their own ecosystem from highly, highly technical academic backgrounds and the AI/ ML developer groups,"" says Burton.""Don’t forget this generation of crypto believers have a set of beliefs that are often inconsistent with working for the banks.""

This is changing as crypto market makers expand. ""Increasingly we are seeing crypto firms prepared to hire people with no specific crypto sales or trading experience but who are prepared to cross the divide from tradfi,"" Burton adds. ""In many cases they will have a very derivative focus whether in FX, commodities or equities. Less so from the rates space where duration is so relevant - but as long as they have privately gone down the crypto rabbit hole they could be a fit. It’s more about being a believer. ""

Sniffing an opportunity, headhunters are flocking to the sector. Toby Hill, a crypto recruiter at Selby Jennings, says demand for people who can work on crypto trading algorithms is growing at an ""unrealistically rapid pace,"" as hedge fund and electronic market makers also push into the asset class. Many are asking for three years' validated track record, says Hill - although this unrealistic given the shortage of candidates fulfilling this criteria.

Crypto trading isn't about risk taking. Burton says the crypto market makers are fundamentally risk averse, and that it's all about arbitrage. ""For a lot of crypto market makers taking any kind of significant directional risk isn’t their game,"" he says. ""They have very high quality algo models that allow them to arbitrage between venues and time zones and the basis trade with futures. In a super volatile asset class with a huge amount of liquidity in private wallets that enter and exit the mainstream exchanges and OTC traders you can’t be too directionally exposed. “

The price of bitcoin shot up by more than $4,000 overnight to recuperate losses suffered last week.

The cryptocurrency reached above $58,000 to close within $10,000 of the all-time high it reached earlier this month.

Follow our live coverage of the crypto market

The 7 per cent price rise was mirrored by several other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ether) and Solana (SOL).

The overall crypto market rose more than 5 per cent to return above $2.5 trillion.

Recommended Bitcoin network overtakes PayPal in quarterly volume

The bounce back could signal an end to the price correction BTC suffered after its record high, which blockchain data suggests was partly caused by long-term investors skimming profits from their holdings.

Concerns surrounding potential new cryptocurrency regulations introduced with the US infrastructure bill also contributed to the downturn, as well as fears that creditors of the collapsed crypto exchange Mt Gox could finally liquidate their payments.

The reason for the recovery is not immediately clear but is likely to be similarly multi-faceted.

One of the simplest explanations is that more bullish investors took the opportunity to “buy the dip” in expectation of the price returning to previous levels.

Among them was El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who said on Friday that the Central American country had acquired “100 extra coins with a discount”.

El Salvador’s treasury now holds more than 1,200 BTC and has plans to use profits to build schools and animal hospitals. President Bukele also recently announced a $1 billion bitcoin bond to help fund the development of “Bitcoin City”.

Private investors also revealed they had acquired more cryptocurrency during the recent dip.

“I bought almost $10m worth of BTC and ETH at the current levels to add to my positions,” Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto rewards firm Celsius Network, tweeted shortly before the market surge.

“We may see a retest of $53k for BTC and $4k for ETH but these should be short term bottoms with us going back to $70k from here.”"
2021-11-24 02:03:52+00:00	Cryptocurrency crash: Bitcoin, Ethereum fall in value. Here are possible causes	[]	"Bitcoin prices fell to their lowest rates since October 13 on Tuesday evening, according to data sourced from CoinDesk – a New York-based news site specialising in cryptocurrencies - that cited a number of factors behind the crash. According to the website, Bitcoin's value depreciated to $55,460.96 last evening, an additional 20 per cent slump from the all-time high of nearly $69,000 that it reached earlier on in November.

However, as per digital currency analysts cited by Forbes, there seems to be no single factor driving the cryptocurrency crash this week, the phenomenon instead being caused by a multitude of factors ranging from “rising selling pressure, end of year profit-taking, as well as speculation”.

Cryptocurrency market remains in red

According to data sourced from crypto exchange WazirX, the digital currency market currently remains in red – with all the major ones such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Binance taking a price dip. While Ethereum fell by 0.86 per cent to trade at $4,167, Solana also dipped by 1.24 per cent to trade at $4,167. The so-called “memecoins” – Doge and SHIB – however, increased their values, though not by a lot; their growths were pegged by the crypto exchange at 0.30 per cent and 1.64 per cent, respectively.

Possible causes behind the cryptocurrency slump

As per John Iadeluca, the founder of multi-strategy fund Banz Capital, there's been a movement of Bitcoin from extremely old wallets that has triggered rumours and apprehension from investors, leading to a potential drop in market price. “Observers are trying to figure out what the movement of Bitcoin from the old wallets means, and whether this indicates large sales of Bitcoin made from these wallets in the near future,” Iadeluca was quoted by Forbes as saying.

There is also reasonable angst among investors regarding Mt Gox, a Japan-based Bitcoin exchange. Once referred to as the world's largest Bitcoin intermediary handling over 70 per cent of all its transactions worldwide, the exchange shut down and suspended trading in 2014. The liquidation proceedings to pay back its customers have still not been resolved, and Mt Gox announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company were “missing” and likely stolen, an amount valued at more than $450 million at the time.

A bankruptcy protection scheme (called the ‘Civil Rehabilitation Plan’), which promised billions of dollars in Bitcoin as compensation, was accepted last month by about 99 per cent of the creditors of the now-defunct exchange. However, the apprehension still runs high: if the creditors – who will now receive more than 140,000 units of Bitcoin – sell their holdings, it would naturally place downward pressure on the price of bitcoin, thereby driving its value down.

India to ban private cryptocurrencies, make way for its own digital tokens

In a related development, the Indian government will be introducing a bill to ban private cryptocurrencies and create a framework for an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during Parliament’s winter session starting November 29.

India, which has seen keen interest among investors to invest in cryptocurrency and also many investors already making investments, continues to warn citizens against putting their money on cryptocurrencies citing high financial risks.

Earlier, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had also mentioned that crypto-assets are extremely risky and that they need to be closely monitored since they hold the potential to disrupt various aspects of the global financial system."
2021-11-11 15:09:14+00:00	While the broader crypto market corrected, this crypto rallied 76,200 precent in a single day	['Bhushan Akolkar']	"The KokoSwap (KOKO) staking platform is undergoing a very major migration of switching from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain.

The migration will cater to a broader community of users excited about gaming and the NFT market.

On Wednesday, November 10, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market entered a correction following an initial pump. The Bitcoin (BTC) price touched an all-time high of $69,000 and went on to correct nearly 10 percent from those levels. A similar scenario appeared in the altcoin space as all top ten altcoins tanked by 4-10 percent.

But this lesser-known cryptocurrency defied the market momentum gaining 76,200 percent in a single day. The price of KokoSwap (KOKO) shot from $0.0099 all the way to a high of $7.63. As of press time, KOKO has seen a partial retracement and is currently trading at $6.65 with a market cap of $1.716 billion.

But KokoSwap is not just any other altcoin in the town showing massive gains. The KokoSwap (KOKO) staking platform is undergoing a very major migration of switching from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain. This migration will allow more user sign-ins along with access to the larger community of gamers in the Binance ecosystem.

KokoSwap has been gaining immense popularity amid the rapidly emerging NFT-gaming wave. Sharat Chandra, a Blockchain & Emerging Tech Evangelist, said:

What makes it interesting is the promising KokoStake staking platform that enables users to invest and generate a high APY income stream. The lure of a passive income stream via staking is hard to resist.

Staking a new trend among gamers

Decentralized Gaming Finance (GameFi) has seen a massive demand picking up in recent times. Moreover, with the rising popularity of play-to-earn games, staking becomes a new trend for gamers to monetize their tokens. Furthermore, the frenzy around NFT and blockchain-based games has shot up significantly this year.

KokoSwap is one such platform that encapsulates all key elements like robust staking, an invite-only celebrity NFT marketplace, and decentralized NFT gaming. Besides, the NFTs and gaming markets have been also receiving major push with several influencers joining the craze.

KokoSwap has been catering to the market demand and thus finds itself in the sweet spot. Furthermore, with the migration away from Ethereum, the platform developers are ensuring that they cater to the broader user base.

Although the Ethereum blockchain remains one of the most popular and in-demand platforms, it continues to face issues of high network congestion. As a result, the high gas fee is also forcing people to move away from Ethereum.

Thus, the upgrade from Ethereum to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a major one for the KokoSwap platform and is backed by users. The decentralized KokoSwap platform combines the best practices of NFT gaming, NFT trading, and crypto trading."
2021-11-16 05:07:51+00:00	Cryptocurrency update: Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptos decline in value, while Tether witnesses rise	['Updated Date']	"The global crypto market cap also saw a fall of 7.10 percent over the last 24 hours and is currently at $2.66 trillion.

Cryptocurrency prices on the morning of Tuesday, 16 November, were a mixed bag. While Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin witnessed a fall in their value till 9:35 am today, Tether witnessed gains.

The global crypto market cap also saw a fall of 7.10 percent over the last 24 hours and is currently at $2.66 trillion.

In terms of price, the value of Bitcoin fell to $ 61,111.26, witnessing a decline of 6.99 percent in the last 24 hours. The token did plunge to a record low this year, falling below $30,000 in June, but made a comeback later on. The digital token has grown immensely over the last few months, up by over 114 percent this year-to-date so far.

Ethereum, the second-largest digital token also saw a fall in its value, falling 7.86 percent in the last 24 hours to $4,320.33. But the currency is also witnessing an all-time high due to the rise of Bitcoin and the wide mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Dogecoin also witnessed a fall in its value as did Shibu Ina. The digital tokens fell by 5.66 percent to $0.2474 and 4.75 percent to $0.00004994 respectively.

Meanwhile, the value of Cardano fell to $1.93, declining by 5.63 percent. XRP also fell by 6.88 percent to $1.13.

Tether rose by 0.09 percent to $1.00 in the last 24 hours. The value of the digital currency has risen by 0.03 percent in the past seven days.

Binance Coin also fell by 7.23 percent in the last 24 hours to $607.23, with the digital token witnessing a decline of 6.41 percent.

The digital currency Solana also fell by 7.47 percent to $225.99 in the last 24 hours.

In other news, Bitcoin underwent a major upgrade on 14 November that enables the execution of more complex transactions by its blockchain. The upgrade makes the token more competitive with Ethereum and has the potential to widen the use of the cryptocurrency."
2021-11-16 07:57:00+00:00	Here's What Led to the $300 Billion Crypto Market Sell-Off Today	[]	"coingape.com Reading time: ~2 m

The cryptocurrency market registered a sharp correction earlier today where the top-10 cryptocurrencies lost 7-10% of their market cap within minutes. The market correction led to nearly $300 billion getting whipped off the crypto market as its valuation fell from $3 trillion to $2.65 trillion at the time of writing. This is the second flash crash in two weeks despite many market pundits predicting November to be a bullish month.

Bitcoin (BTC) wiped off the majority of its gains from November as the price of the top cryptocurrency fell to near $60K. The top cryptocurrency was trading above $66K in the morning before recording a weekly low of $60,583. As visible on the monthly candle, the market sell-off has turned it red from green.

Apart from BTC major altcoins including Ether registered a steeper decline in price as ETH fell to a daily low of $4,271. However, ETH’s monthly chart still has a green candle thanks to its mammoth rise this month, rising from just under $4K to set several new ATHs.

Apart from the stablecoins, the majority of the volatile crypto market bled in red and wiped off major gains from the month of November. Nearly $500 million worth of leveraged positions also got liquidated.

Did Passing of $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill Lead to the Market Wipe-Off?

The traditional financial market is suffering due to high inflation caused by overprinting by the feds, but governments continue to print more money to restrict the damages caused by the printing of money. Many believe the sudden decline in the crypto market came because of the approval of the controversial infrastructure bill that turned into law earlier today.

The crypto taxation part in particular divided the senate at the time of discussion, where those who are not well versed with a decentralized market called for a total surveillance system and impossible tax reporting demands, while a few Republican senators opposed it tooth and nail and suggested for a more inclusive law."
2021-11-23 17:09:14+00:00	November Crypto Market Turbulance Shakes Holders To Their Core	[]	"With an average 6% loss and a 10% correction in the weekly chart for Bitcoin, Cardano (ADA), XRP, and others, the crypto market has been trading in choppy waters for the past days. The uncertainty has brought a change in the sentiment, as traders prepare for further downside.

Data from Arcane Research records a flipped in the Fear and Greed Index, the indicator has quickly moved from “Greed” to “Fear” as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap retested critical support levels.

Bitcoin had a particularly bad week in terms of performance as an increase in volatility caused the price to fluctuate in a range between $55,4000 and $60,000. On the other hand, Ethereum has showed more strength as it has been able to quickly bounce back from its low and into the mid area around its current levels.

Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Holds Key Support, Why BTC Remains At Risk of Sharp Decline



As Arcane Research noted, the crypto market’s sentiment is still far from suggesting a cycle top. Despite the downside pressure, fundamental remains for future appreciation as most cryptocurrencies successfully retested their monthly lows. Arcane Research noted the following:

(…) in bull markets, the Fear and Greed Index indicate “greed” or “extreme greed” for more extended periods with short periodical visits to the “fear” area, just like we saw this spring. Therefore, a “fear” level is not necessarily a signal that the current bull market is over (…).

Why The Crypto Market Could Need More Blood Before New ATHs

The short term paints a very different picture for Bitcoin and the rest of major crypto. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been showing strength as the market trends downwards.

However, as analyst Justin Bennett pointed out, the U.S. currency could have found a local top. This could provide some breathing for crypto and allowed them to return to their previous high or take another shot at critical resistance price points.

Despite the above, traders still need to maintain caution. Although there has been a reset across the crypto market, the derivatives sectors still show signs of being overheated with most exchanges recording neutral funding rates that quickly turn positive on breakouts to the upside.

Thus, why Jarvis Labs believes Bitcoin and the crypto market could re-entered price discovery once funding rates turn negative, as it did in September 2021. This could dip the Fear and Greed Index further down the fear levels into Extreme Fear.

2021-11-16 00:00:00+00:00	Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin slips 8%; Ethereum, Dogecoin & Litecoin fall up to 13%	[]	"World's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell nearly 8% today. The price of Bitcoin slipped 7.91% to $60,640 on Coinmarketcap. Market cap of the cryptocurrency reached $1,146 billion.

Currently, the global crypto market cap stands at $2.65 trillion, a slide of 7.74%. Other cryptocurrencies too were trading in the red today.

Ethereum tanked 9.46% to $4,270 and Dogecoin was trading 6.36% lower at $0.2447. Digital token Stellar crashed 8.67% to $0.3529 and Litecoin lost 12.76% to $243.06.

XRP declined 7.61% to $1.12 and Uniswap lost 10.60% to $21.95. Of late, crypto prices have risen on the back of comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC's Cathie Wood.

In late July, Elon Musk said Tesla was ""most likely"" to start accepting bitcoin as payment again. The comment helped the cryptocurrency race past the $30,000 level.

The electric carmaker said in May that it would no longer accept the cryptocurrency for purchases. It's been a wild ride for bitcoin the last three years.

The digital currency made its big Wall Street debut in December 2017, when the major futures exchanges rolled out Bitcoin futures. The attention drove Bitcoin to roughly $19,300, a then-unheard of price for the currency."
2021-11-11 00:00:00+00:00	16% of Americans say they have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency	['Andrew Perrin']	"A smartphone app shows cryptocurrency exchange rates in April. (Chris Delmas/AFP via Getty Images)

The vast majority of U.S. adults have heard at least a little about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether, and 16% say they personally have invested in, traded or otherwise used one, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Men ages 18 to 29 are particularly likely to say they have used cryptocurrencies.

Overall, 86% of Americans say they have heard at least a little about cryptocurrencies, including 24% who say they have heard a lot about them, according to the survey of U.S. adults, conducted Sept. 13-19, 2021. Some 13% say they have heard nothing at all.

In 2015, the Center asked Americans different questions that were focused exclusively on Bitcoin. At the time, 48% of adults said they had heard of Bitcoin (to any degree), and just 1% said they had ever collected, traded or used it.

Pew Research Center has conducted several studies about Americans and cryptocurrency. This survey was conducted among 10,371 U.S. adults from Sept. 13-19, 2021. Everyone who took part is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology. This survey includes a total sample size of 362 Asian Americans. The sample includes English-speaking Asian Americans only and, therefore, may not be representative of the overall Asian American population. Despite this limitation, it is important to report the views of Asian Americans on the topics in this study. As always, Asian Americans’ responses are incorporated into the general population figures throughout this report. Because of the relatively small sample size and a reduction in precision due to weighting, we are not able to analyze Asian American respondents by demographic categories, such as gender, age or education.

In the new survey, certain demographic groups are particularly likely to say they have used cryptocurrencies, with some of the largest differences by age and gender.

Roughly three-in-ten Americans ages 18 to 29 (31%) say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ether, compared with smaller shares of adults in older age groups. Men are about twice as likely as women to say they ever used a cryptocurrency (22% vs. 10%).

These differences are especially pronounced when looking at age and gender together. About four-in-ten men ages 18 to 29 (43%), for example, say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency, compared with 19% of women in the same age range. Among both men and women, the likelihood of having invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency decreases with age.

Asian, Black and Hispanic adults are more likely than White adults to say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency. There are no statistically significant differences by household income.

While majorities across demographic groups say they have heard at least a little about cryptocurrency, smaller shares say they have heard a lot. For example, adults under 50 (31%) and men (35%) are more likely than older Americans (16%) and women (15%), respectively, to say they have heard a lot.

The share of adults who have heard a lot about cryptocurrency also varies by race, ethnicity and household income. For example, 43% of Asian Americans say they have heard a lot about cryptocurrency, compared with 29% of Hispanic adults and about a quarter of Black or White adults. Americans with higher incomes (31%) are more likely than those with middle (25%) and lower incomes (21%) to have heard a lot about cryptocurrency.

These findings emerge as government leaders and others debate the regulation of cryptocurrency – which has been defined as a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized, with no central authority that manages and maintains its value. Financial regulators have worried about policing cryptocurrencies and have raised concerns about the long-term viability of such currencies, such as Bitcoin.

China recently banned transactions using cryptocurrencies. U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell said this summer that these currencies need more regulation, and the Biden administration is trying to combat ransomware by cracking down on cryptocurrency payments. At the same time, El Salvador in September became the first country to declare Bitcoin as legal tender.

La Monica', 'Cnn Business']	"New York (CNN Busines) Bitcoin has rocketed to an all-time high of nearly $70,000. But investors are even more excited about ethereum, which is now the world's second most valuable cryptocurency.

Ethereum, or ether for short, is also trading at record levels. It's now hovering around $4,850, having soared more than 560% this year, compared to the ""mere"" 135% pop for bitcoin . Crypto investors are betting that ether will continue to be used as the backbone for even more non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, as well as so-called smart contracts.

Experts predict that this wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) will become more prevalent in banking. That could be great news for ether, as well as solana, another crypto that has blockchain technology used in DeFi applications.

Ether, which now has a total value of about $575 billion for all its coins in circulations, has also narrowed the market cap gap with bitcoin, which is worth about $1.3 trillion. The two cryptos now make up almost two-thirds of the nearly $3 trillion cryptocurrency market.

""We're seeing a shift in the industry where bitcoin went from being 75 percent of the overall cryptocurrency market cap to about 50 percent,"" Michael Pinsker, founder and president of wealth management tech firm Docupace, said about the drop in bitcoin's market share since 2017. ""That percentage should come down even further."""

According to crypto analytics platform CoinGecko, which currently tracks over 10,000 coins across 517 trading platforms, the market cap of all assets increased by 4.1% over the last day, peaking at $3.019 trillion.

Among those leading the charge is Dogecoin (DOGE), which reached a local high of $0.292 on Monday before backtracking to $0.283 by the time of writing. This is still a 7% increase over the day, making the meme coin the best performing asset among the ten-largest cryptocurrencies.

Dogecoin experienced an extremely volatile few weeks, and on several occasions was even flipped by Shiba Inu, another dog-inspired meme coin that rose to prominence over the last year.

It, however, regained ninth place in the rankings after SHIB’s massive sell-off last week, with the current market cap standing at $37.45 billion.

Ethereum hits new high

Ethereum (ETH) has also entered the spotlight.

The market’s second-largest assets broke a new all-time of $4,782 earlier on Monday, before slipping down to $4,736 by press time.

Ethereum, which is up 2.5% over the day and a massive 987% since the start of the year, is now responsible for as much as 18.7% of the combined crypto market capitalization with $563.4 billion.

Bitcoin (BTC) is on the rise as well, having recorded a 5.9% increase over the last day per CoinGecko.

The world’s oldest cryptocurrency traded between $61,000 and 63,000 for the most part of the last week, before hitting a local high of $66,362 on Monday.

Being just 1.7% shy of its all-time high of $67,276 recorded on October 20, Bitcoin is 22.2% over the last month and 345.5% since the start of the year. With the network’s value above 1.246 trillion, the leading cryptocurrency is currently dominating as much as 41.5% of the entire market.

Coincidence or not, but today’s price action came shortly after Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), tweeted that he expects “a big week” for crypto, with his post amassing more than 16,000 likes and over 1,900 retweets by press time.

Going to be a big week — Barry Silbert (@BarrySilbert) November 7, 2021

DCG, which is the parent company of Grayscale Investments and Genesis Trading, is among a dozen other companies hoping to land approval for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by actual Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin futures contracts.

Last week, DCG also announced a massive $700 million investment from the likes of Softbank and Google's parent company Alphabet Inc., which brought the firm’s valuation to $10 billion."

China Evergrande Group again failed to pay interest to international investors on three bonds due on Wednesday, Deutsche Marktscreening Agentur (DMSA) said in a press release.

The 30-day grace period ended today

According to DMSA, Evergrande is liable to make $148.13 million in interest payments by Wednesday – the end of the 30-day grace period – and yet, international investors, including itself, have not received any interest payment.

According to the German Market Screening Agency’s senior analyst Dr Marco Metzler, today’s default puts Evergrande only days away from an official collapse.

DMSA is preparing bankruptcy proceedings against Evergrande. As soon as a court opens insolvency proceedings, Evergrande will also be officially bankrupt – and that is only a matter of days. We’re already holding talks with other investors and would be pleased if they were to join our action group.

Evergrande has over $300 billion in liabilities

International market bonds account for $19 billion out of the total of over $300 billion Evergrande has in liabilities. In September, it already defaulted on interest payments on two bonds and on December 28th, another two will be due to pay $255 million in interest.

The news comes almost a month after DMSA confirmed in a study that Evergrande’s collapse will have repercussions for the global financial system. Metzler added:

While the international financial market has so far met the financial turmoil surrounding the teetering giant Evergrande with a remarkable basis confidence – one can also say: with remarkable naivety – the U.S. central bank Fed confirmed our view yesterday. In its latest stability report, it explicitly pointed out the dangers that a collapse of Evergrande could have for the global financial system."
