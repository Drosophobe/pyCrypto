I Am A Bitcoin Evangelist']"	"The crypto asset known as Theta was the hottest altcoin in the space during May, but false rumors of a partnership with Google led to a strong selloff.

The downside in the cryptocurrency looks to continue, as two highly accurate sell signals have triggered on weekly timeframes on both the USD and BTC trading pairs.

Theta Pumps Nearly 400% Against the Dollar in May, 350% Against Bitcoin

At the start of May to the peak of the pump, the altcoin known as Theta rallied over 360% against Bitcoin. There was a matching nearly 400% rise on the USD trading pair.

The rally was fueled by false information spreading about a partnership with Google, however, it was later revealed that the partnership was simply Theta relying on Google’s cloud services on the client-side.

While no true partnership exists, the massive surge brought back memories of the crypto hype bubble.

During that time, it wasn’t uncommon to see altcoins rally hundreds of percent against Bitcoin or the dollar.

While those days are long gone, and money won’t be as easy to come by during the next cycle, Theta’s recent explosion provides much-needed hope that a return to a crypto bull market may soon be coming.

But before any sustained bullish advance or uptrend begins, Theta is due for a stronger correction, according go a duo of highly accurate sell signals across the THETAUSD and THETABTC trading pairs.

USD & BTC Sell Signals Could Cause The Attractive Altcoin To Dump Further

Over the last month, few altcoins were discussed as highly as Theta. The asset quickly became the crypto industry’s hottest token.

But as soon as overly eager investors realized the partnership news was a non-event, a selloff cut the gains back significantly.

More downside is also very likely, given a set of sell setups signaled by the TD Sequential indicator on weekly timeframes.

The TD Sequential indicator is a market-timing tool developed by Thomas Demark. After a specific sequence of candles form, it often is a sign that a reversal or pullback is near.

The signal has called many Bitcoin and altcoin tops and bottoms over the last several years, dating back to Bitcoin’s all-time high. It’s proven that its a tool that should never be underestimated.

The 9 sell setup has appeared on both THETAUSD and THETABTC price charts, suggesting that not only is a collapse in USD value expected, but the altcoin will underperform against Bitcoin in the days ahead.

TD 9 sell signals have appeared across most cryptocurrency assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, and countless others. The crypto market’s best performer, Theta, also sharing this signal doesn’t bode well for the entire asset class.

Crypto as a whole often follows Bitcoin’s lead, and while sentiment and fundamentals have never been more bullish for Bitcoin, the asset is also facing its strongest resistance yet.

Should another crash happen in Bitcoin ahead of a clean breakout from the downtrend, a lower high could cause extreme panic and a selloff will soon follow.

Bitcoin crashing from here would carry the entire crypto market down with it, Theta included."

2020-06-15 20:00:32+00:00	Ethereum Likely to Dive Towards $200 as Overnight Selloff Rattles Market Structure	['Cole Is A Cryptocurrency Analyst Based In Los Angeles. He Studied At The University Of California Irvine', 'Has Been Interested In Bitcoin', 'The Crypto Markets Since']	"Ethereum has decline today alongside Bitcoin and the aggregated crypto market, breaking below a key support level that was previously being defended by buyers

It now appears that ETH could be well positioned to see even further downside in the days and weeks ahead

One technical indicator is forecasting that it will plunge to $200 before it is able to garner any notable buying pressure

This could lead it to break below a key support level, and catalyze a far-reaching downtrend

Prior to yesterday evening, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the aggregated crypto market had been caught within a consolidation phase that persisted for many weeks.

Although the overnight decline seen by most major cryptocurrencies did cause them to shatter the lower boundaries of these consolidation channels, it is important to note that buyers have still defended several key levels.

In the case of Etheereum, although the crypto was previously flashing some signs of immense strength, its dependence on Bitcoin has made it prone to the weakness seen by the entire crypto market today.

That being said, one technical indicator is now suggesting that it will continue plunging until it reaches $200.

This would force it below a key support level, and potentially kick off a notable downtrend in the weeks ahead.

Ethereum Declines Alongside Entire Crypto Market; Key Support Fast Approaches

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down just under 6% at its current price of $222.65. It has been flashing some intense signs of weakness throughout the past 12 hours, as it has also declined by over 2% against its Bitcoin trading pair.

It does appear that this weakness will extend further in the near-term, as this latest decline forced it below $230 – the level that marked the lower boundary of its previous trading range.

One analyst also explained that $215 is an important level for it to maintain above. This happens to be around the point at which it was finding significant resistance throughout most of May – as seen in the below chart.

Here’s Why ETH Could Soon Reel Towards $200

There is one respected technical indicator that suggests Ethereum is poised to post a notable decline in the days and weeks ahead.

Another prominent analyst spoke about this technical indicator in a recent tweet, explaining that it shows ETH is likely to reel towards $200 before finding any notable support, while also showing that Bitcoin could soon hit $8,500.

“BTC and ETH Cloud pretty clear on targets here. 8.5 and 200. Another way to think of this: HH less probable than retrace/mean reversion,” he explained while pointing to the below chart.

How Ethereum trends in the days ahead should provide valuable insights into just how much technical damage was done by its recent price decline.

2020-06-10 15:11:29+00:00	Cryptocurrency News Roundup for June 10, 2020	[]	"In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has been range-bound between $9,570 and $9,870. The flagship crypto broke out above the $9,800 level, giving many traders hope that the $10,000 milestone was in sight. However, it was pushed back shortly afterwards and is trading at $9,750 at press time.

While Bitcoin is yet to make a decisive move, some other cryptos are on the up and up. DOGE and LINK have been some of the most promising, with the latter looking set to hit its all-time high price.

Bitcoin’s Indecisive Movement

Bitcoin’s price is up by a mere 0.6% in the past 24 hours. As BeInCrypto reported earlier today, the price broke out from a short-term descending resistance line that has been in place since June 5. This suggests that the price is likely to move up in the short-term. It is, however, unlikely to affect the crypto’s long-term price movements.

A breakout from its current level could take it up to $9,950. However, if a rejection occurs, the price could drop to the $9,450 support level. This would most likely lead the crypto to test the $9,000 support level in the short-term.

ChainLink and Dogecoin on the Uptrend

Despite Bitcoin’s indecisive movement, some altcoins have shown great promise. One of these is Dogecoin (DOGE) which seems to be on the verge of a breakout after bouncing on the support line of a bullish pattern. According to one expert, the current surge will see Dogecoin hit $0.0032. The just-for-laughs coin is trading at $0.00257.

ChainLink (LINK) is yet another altcoin that seems poised to break out. The crypto has been on an uptrend in the past two months but is approaching a crucial resistance level that will determine its short-term future. The price looks set to test its all-time high, which it achieved on March 3. The price is expected to hit $4.9 shortly.

Bitcoin Could Lose Its Throne in a Few Years

Bitcoin has remained perched on top of the crypto world since launch, but this may not be the case for much longer. BTC’s dominance has been dwindling since September last year and currently sits at 64.7%. According to one expert, Bitcoin’s inefficiencies, lack of smart contracts and slow transaction speed will be its ultimate downfall.

Bitcoin’s dominance has also broken away from its price. In the past, its price was positively correlated to its dominance, but as BeInCrypto recently reported, the trend has changed.

A Third of European Investors Own Crypto

Bitcoin is still the most popular crypto in Europe with a 25% holding, while Ethereum comes in second at 11%.

Bitcoin Could be a World Reserve Currency Says Financial Author and Tech Visionary Jeff Booth

On June 11, 2020, the entrepreneur and best-selling author, Jeff Booth, spoke with Max Keiser of Keiser Report about bitcoin (BTC). Booth seems to think that BTC has a good chance of being a “world reserve currency.” The author tells Keiser that the central banks’ massive creation of money has been a force that is driving bitcoin’s trend toward being a world reserve.

“Those forces, competing against each other, are driving essential asset prices up… People are trying to work harder to keep up with rising asset prices that are created in the first place by the central governments’ trend to stop deflation,” Booth said. The CEO of e-commerce company Builddirect also added:

I see bitcoin as a likely, a very likely candidate for a world reserve currency. So, I see it has a really good chance of winning over time as it works on a network effect.

Placeholder VC Partner Chris Burniske Expects Ethereum to Touch $7,500 if Bitcoin Reaches $50K

On June 14, 2020, the former lead researcher at Ark Invest and Placeholder VC partner, Chris Burniske, discussed ETH price predictions on Twitter.

On Sunday, Burniske tweeted: If BTC goes [to] $50,000 in the next cycle, and ETH/BTC returns to its former ATH, then expect to see ETH [to] $7,500.” The Placeholder VC partner and analyst further said:

Why bitcoin to $50,000? As discussed in May 2019, if BTC is half as volatile in this cycle as it was in the last, we would still expect it to cross $50K and $1 trillion in network value. $1 trillion has been a long time coming for this macro-asset. Meanwhile, to the mainstream, ETH will be the new kid on the block — expect a frenzy to go with that realization.
