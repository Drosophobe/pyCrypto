3969	2018-07-02 23:57:04+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff: “I think the crypto bubble will pop before the fiat bubble will, and in doing so I think it will succeed in doing something it shouldn’t, it will succeed in making fiat money look good.” #VoorheesVsSchiff https://t.co/vTi64LwTbV
3970	2018-07-02 23:54:58+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff: “You can’t debase bitcoin because there’s nothing to debase. It has no value.” #VoorheesVsSchiff https://t.co/Kd31kFGlEu

3973	2018-07-02 23:42:33+00:00	CoinDesk	.@ErikVoorhees: “The biggest obstacle to adoption is most individuals want governments to manage money for them. Until that changes, bitcoin will play second fiddle.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3974	2018-07-02 23:39:33+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff: “I think a lot of people are in crypto because they think they’re going to get rich.” #VoorheesVsSchiff https://t.co/94GebjIlK0
3975	2018-07-02 23:38:00+00:00	CoinDesk	.@ErikVoorhees: “We need to get rid of this word, ‘faith.’ People aren’t in cryptocurrency because they have faith, they’re in it because they use it.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3976	2018-07-02 23:36:41+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff: “You have to concede that another cryptocurrency might replace bitcoin … and if another cryptocurrency can replace bitcoin, another cryptocurrency can replace that one.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3977	2018-07-02 23:36:25+00:00	CoinDesk	Asked what it would take to change his mind, @ErikVoorhees says “if something better than cryptocurrency happened...I think if there was a five-year period where the entire crypto market just slowly dwindled, I’d have to reassess.”#VoorheesVsSchiff

3980	2018-07-02 23:30:11+00:00	CoinDesk	The debate enters a Q&amp;A session.@ErikVoorhees: “Well, the government can absolutely outlaw bitcoin. More easily [than it would be to ban gold],” but adds that it would be hard to enforce.#VoorheesVsSchiff
3981	2018-07-02 23:20:07+00:00	CoinDesk	@PeterSchiff cites the market decline seen over the last six months as an explanation on why the demand for bitcoin may decline: “You’ve destroyed your brand, once people sell at a loss they’re not coming back.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3982	2018-07-02 23:18:32+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff argues that gold is irreplaceable, but bitcoin isn't:“What’s the odds that bitcoin’s the best cryptocurrency that’s ever going to be invented? … Nobody’s come up with a better gold.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3983	2018-07-02 23:12:11+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff says intrinsic value refers to what someone can use with a form of money other than as a means of exchange. Gold has uses, but bitcoin does not have alternative uses. #VoorheesVsSchiff

3985	2018-07-02 23:07:47+00:00	CoinDesk	.@ErikVoorhees defends his stance, saying: “I remember when it was a big deal when bitcoin moved 50 percent. Today, it’s a big deal when it moves 10 percent. I think in a few years it’ll be a big deal when it moves 2-3 percent. While bitcoin is volatile today...
3986	2018-07-02 23:04:13+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff adds: “It’s the same confidence that you have in the dollar or the euro, but the dollar, you have legal tender … but no one needs bitcoin.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3987	2018-07-02 23:03:46+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff concludes: “I think in the end, I agree with Erik completely that the fiat monetary system that we have now is not going to work, but replacing fiat currency with digital currency is not an improvement. What gives bitcoin value? Confidence.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3988	2018-07-02 22:59:57+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff, Euro Pacific Capital CEO, says “the biggest problem with bitcoin and why it can never be used as money is because it(currency) has to be a reliable store of value, not just a medium of exchange.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3989	2018-07-02 22:52:44+00:00	CoinDesk	.@PeterSchiff, Euro Pacific Capital CEO, argues “I’m not here to defend fiat currency, I think we’re headed for a currency crisis. I just don’t think bitcoin is going to succeed where the dollar had failed.”#VoorheesVsSchiff
3990	2018-07-02 22:48:19+00:00	CoinDesk	@ErikVoorhees: “Your bank can destroy your fiat with the click of a button. With fiat, you are forever dependent on a third party for your wealth.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3991	2018-07-02 22:45:55+00:00	CoinDesk	@ErikVoorhees says bitcoin has a limited supply, is easily divisible, fungible and cross-border. These attributes mean it is “good money.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
3992	2018-07-02 22:43:05+00:00	CoinDesk	@ErikVoorhees added: “Bitcoin possesses not only all the attributes of good money, but all the attributes of extremely good money.” #VoorheesVsSchiff
