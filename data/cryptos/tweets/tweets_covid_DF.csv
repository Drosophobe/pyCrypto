380	2020-10-27 15:36:28+00:00	CoinDesk	"3. The time-dilation attack, the most complex and serious of the bunch, requires a “sybil attack” on a victim’s Lightning node.

381	2020-10-27 15:36:27+00:00	CoinDesk	2. For a “flood and loot” attack, an attacker would spam routed payments through a victim’s node and force close each channel together.
