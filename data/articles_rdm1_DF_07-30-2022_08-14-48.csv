2020-02-25 10:05:26+00:00	Crypto market sees extensive bloodbath as Bitcoin reaches key level	['Cole Petersen', 'News Desk', 'Chainwire', 'Samuel Wan', 'Andjela Radmilac', 'Joseph Young', 'Ali Martinez']	"After a futile attempt to kick off another uptrend yesterday, the crypto market has seen an intense selloff that has stemmed from Bitcoin’s move down to $9,500, which has subsequently led most major altcoins to plummet lower.

This bloodbath has led most major cryptocurrencies to form an incredibly close correlation to Bitcoin, and it is highly probable that where the aggregated market heads next will be dependent on whether or not BTC is able to hold above a key level that it is currently trading at.

If the benchmark crypto breaks below this level, it could spark a market-wide selloff that leads many major altcoins to invalidate the bullish market structures they have formed over the past several weeks.

Crypto market sees intense selloff following Bitcoin’s bearish rejection

Yesterday, Bitcoin attempted to make a move up to $10,000 that was met with significant selling pressure, subsequently leading BTC to plummet towards $9,500.

This rejection sent shockwaves throughout the aggregated crypto market, with many altcoins that were previously expressing bullishness to see notable selloffs.

At the time of writing, Tezos and Chainlink – two of the best performing altcoins in 2020–are leading today’s drop, trading down 8 percent and 7.5 percent respectively.

Most other altcoins are closely trailing these losses, with Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, and others all trading down roughly 6 percent.

The only major cryptocurrency that has been able to dodge losses of this magnitude is Ethereum, which is trading down just under 3 percent.

Where altcoins go next depends on how Bitcoin reacts to one key level

Today’s selloff has led Bitcoin to a key support level at $9,550 that bulls are currently attempting to defend, and a drop below this level could open the gates for significantly further near-term losses.

Big Chonis, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, spoke about this key level in a recent tweet, referencing the level seen on the below chart.

“Very important area that Bitcoin bulls want to hold…Has acted as support to resistance and back to support… weekly!”

In the near-term, how deep the ongoing altcoin selloff extends will likely rest largely on whether BTC is able to further extend its upwards momentum, as a failure to do so will likely lead investors to flee their altcoin positions in favor of BTC."
2020-02-22 10:35:25+00:00	Can the Total Crypto Market Cap Hit $10 trillion by 2023?	[]	"Popular YouTube crypto analyst, Benjamin Cowen, has been considering the logarithmic regression band for the total cryptocurrency market cap in his latest video, and based on his analysis, thinks that the total digital asset market cap could hit $10 trillion during the next bull run.

What’s A Logarithmic Regression Band?

While it may sound like AI-generated musicians for psychotherapists to relax to, the logarithmic regression band is actually the range of values to which the crypto market tends to fall back when it is not in a bubble. It is represented by the green band on the chart below.

The line forms a smooth curve overtime when plotted against a logarithmic value scale. At the peak of the 2017-2018 bubble/burst cycle, the total crypto market cap came very close to $1 trillion. However, it has since fallen back to the regression band and currently stands at around $290 billion.

Diminishing Returns Each Crypto Market Cycle

Plotting the difference between the total market cap and the lowest point of the regression band over time shows that the peak levels are becoming lower with each market cycle. This supports the theory of diminishing returns over time.

Assuming this behavior continues, we can project a potential peak level above the regression band for the next major bull run. As an example, Cowen projects this happening in 2022, but of course, it could be earlier or later than this, if it happens at all.

The potential outcome of this would be a total cryptocurrency market cap of around $10 trillion at the peak of the next bubble. In this scenario market cap is likely to oscillate within the regression band for a while before starting its climb.

But What About $100 Trillion Bitcoin?

Ah yes, according to PlanB’s stock to flow (S2F) model, the Bitcoin market cap alone is projected to go to $100 trillion. Cowen’s $10 Trillion market cap peak for the entire crypto market doesn’t sound so impressive against that prediction.

Of course, the $100 trillion Bitcoin is still some way off in the future. The projected price increases in the S2F model happen because of the artificial limiting of supply over time. The next halving will happen in May this year.

However, the $100 trillion projection isn’t due until another two halvings after that, or sometime in 2028. So, for now, a $10 trillion market cap by 2022 will have to do.

At current Bitcoin dominance levels, a $10 trillion total crypto market cap gives a BTC price of around $330,000, so that’s something to look forward to.

Do you think the total crypto market cap will hit a $10 trillion valuation in 2023? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

2020-02-20 14:03:27+00:00	Top Analyst: Foul Play Pumped the Crypto Market by $66 Billion	"['Yashu Gola Is A Mumbai-Based Finance Journalist. He Is Profoundly Active In The Bitcoin Space Since', 'Has Contributed To Several Cryptocurrency Media Outlets', 'Including Newsbtc', 'Fxdailyreport', 'Bitcoinist', 'Ccn. Academically', ""Yashu Holds A Bachelor'S In Information Technology"", 'With Majors In Data Structures', 'C', ""Programming Language. He Has Also Won The 'Atulya Award' For His Efforts Towards Raising""]"	"Jacob Canfield, a crypto market analyst known for accurately predicting bitcoin’s 2020 price rally, has alleged that there was market manipulation in the trading of altcoins this year.

In a video published last week, Mr. Canfield linked the resurgence of otherwise underperforming cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and EOS to PlusToken, a Ponzi scheme that, under the disguise of a high yield investment company, stole over $3 billion from its clients. The steal included 70,000 bitcoin, 790,000 ether, and 26 million EOS tokens.

Mr. Canfield noted that PlusToken scammers first artificially pumped bitcoin from $3,500 to circa $14,000 last year. They then sold about 70-90K BTC in the range of $9,000 and $13,000, which roughly equals about $600 million. The profitable move gave them enough capital to drive the altcoin market upward.

“If [Plustoken scammers] are using their capital to push the Ethereum market, then they can push its prices back to $300, $500, $600 and even $1,000,” said Mr. Canfield. “They can also set up traps for short-sellers and continue to push the short-seller cascade in thin-order markets.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpiUaytYuFo

The statements came at the time when altcoins are severely outperforming their top rival bitcoin. Ethereum and EOS, for instance, surged by up to 130 and 155 percent after bottoming out in December 2019. In the same timeframe, bitcoin surged by up to 63 percent only.

On the whole, the crypto market – excluding bitcoin – attracted up to circa $66 billion between December 2019 until February 2020 top.

Mr. Canfield theorized that PlusToken scammers are using cryptocurrency exchanges and OTC brokers with closed order-books to trade their steal for alternative crypto tokens. The analyst further admitted that he has stopped entering short leveraged positions over his fears of fat price dumps.

Crypto Trend Will Continue

Despite fears of a massive dump, Mr. Canfield believed the crypto market will keep rising. The analyst recommended traders to identify near-term dips to buy Ethereum, EOS or other altcoins but exit their positions on the first signs of deep pullbacks.

He further advised traders to watch the crypto wallets that belong to the scammers associated with PlusToken, noting that any kind of small or big withdrawal would alert them of a potential bearish correction."
2020-02-20 20:34:23+00:00	Analyst: Feds might have crashed the Bitcoin (BTC) market yesterday	['Decrypt', 'Robert Stevens']	"Bitcoin’s sudden drop in price yesterday from $10,00 to $9,507, could be related to the United States Marshals Service announcing it had auctioned off $37 million in forfeited Bitcoin, an analyst at the social investment network eToro said today.

“Put simply, bitcoin's price drop yesterday was due to a dump in the market,” eToro’s Simon Peters told Decrypt. “This followed a United States Marshals Service announcement earlier this week stating they had sold off roughly 4,000 BTC (around $37 million) that had been seized from criminal cases.” On February 18, the US Marshals sold 4,041 Bitcoins that had been forfeited in criminal cases, or seized by authorities.

Drugs kill

Some of the money was related to the sale and distribution of drugs. For instance, over $200,000 worth of crypto sold by the US Marshals was forfeited by drug dealers from Alabama. Tyler Lee Ward and Henry Long Nguyen were imprisoned in May 2019 for conspiring to sell Alprazolam, maintaining a “drug-involved premise,” and “conspiracy to commit money laundering,” according to a press statement by the Department of Justice.

“Analysts feared the auction winner could potentially make a cash gain by selling the bitcoin on a public exchange, especially if they've acquired the coins for below market price,” said Peters.

Whale Alert, a Twitter accounts that tracks movements on various blockchains and flags large transactions, reported on Tuesday that 6,000 Bitcoins were transferred from an unknown wallet to Bitfinex. Whether this was the auction winnings or not is not clear—the sale was for a little over 4,000 Bitcoin, and split between several different bids—but it sure smelled like it.

Whether yesterday's dump is direct manipulation or just coincidence, “the jury is still out,” said Peters. But “what is evident is that overall liquidity of the crypto market must improve in order to prevent large market orders leading to such volatile price swings in the future,” he added."

Cryptocurrency markets have been climbing higher in value as coins like BTC have gained over 19% during the last 90 days. However, many other digital assets have seen much larger gains and BTC dominance has been sliding downwards consecutively for the last 14 days.

BTC’s Ratio of Market Dominance Sinks to 60%

During the last few weeks, BTC dominance has dropped from a high of 70% to a low of 60%. The term and metric BTC dominance is the ratio of BTC’s market capitalization versus all the other coin market caps. So the current market valuation of the entire cryptoconomy is around $305 billion and BTC captures 61% of that today with a market valuation of around $186 billion. BTC has always been the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and prior to February 2017, the asset captured more than 80% of the entire cryptoconomy for eight years straight. However, the video tweet below shared in 2018 shows how crypto dominance metrics can change drastically over time.

After February 26, 2017, BTC dominance slid from 85% to a low of 40% one month later. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) spiked to an all-time high of 31% of the cryptoconomy’s overall valuation and XRP was at 17%. A number of people believe that BTC’s rising network fees and clogged backlog (mempool) of transactions in 2017 and 2018 attributed to the decline. Alongside this, many crypto proponents and traders referred to the time as “alt season,” in which a variety of alternative digital assets reduce BTC’s share of the entire coin market cap.

After BTC dropped to a low of 40%, the dominance metric slid even lower in January 2018 as BTC dominance was around 33%. Since then, the digital currency has regained a lot of market cap dominance and BTC had risen to close to 70% on September 8, 2019. However, after the jump to 70%, BTC’s share of the cryptoconomy has been sliding once again. From September’s high of 70%, BTC dominance has dropped down to 60% on February 15, 2020, losing roughly 10%. The sliding metric has been due to other digital assets that have done far better percentage-wise as far as gains are concerned. For instance, during the last 90 days, BTC has gained 19%, but ETH jumped 52%, XRP 26%, BCH 82%, and BSV rose by 185% in that time period. BTC dominance has slid consecutively for the last 14 days straight to its current low and only today has it started to rise again slightly. It’s been one of the longest downward slides for BTC dominance since September 2018.

Are Market Valuations and Dominance Important Metrics?

Even though BTC dominance is a metric used by crypto market price aggregation websites, many proponents do not believe the data reflects any real value. Market caps only reflect the current worth of every coin circulating in real-time and some people think the data can be skewed. Despite the fact that a number of crypto proponents believe market caps and dominance are inadequate value metrics and do not necessarily reflect the project’s real worth, these metrics are used by the majority of crypto enthusiasts. In the early days, after assets like namecoin, ripple, litecoin, and mastercoin appeared, the website coinmarketcap.com was developed and the public were able to compare coins based on market valuations. There’s now a great variety of coin market cap aggregation websites that show similar data and provide other statistics too like trade volumes.

Despite some believing that market cap lists are not a good reflection of real value, individuals find the data very important. As mentioned above, investors believe there are significant reasons for BTC dominance declines, whether it was the network stress or alt season that prompted the decline from 85% to 33%. Market caps and dominance metrics show investors the level of risk involved as small-caps, mid-caps, and large-caps see different types of movements.

Traditionally, mid to small market caps are far more volatile than larger-cap cryptocurrencies and they can spike in price and drop in value very quickly. People view market valuation and dominance as a reliability metric because large caps usually present less risk to investors. Smaller crypto market caps provide investors with high-risk trading situations which can be good or bad depending on how the individual is trading.

The fact that BTC lost 61% of the dominance it commanded over the entire cryptoconomy between February 2017 and January 2018 is a metric of great importance to a lot of crypto enthusiasts. When BTC’s dominance climbed from 33% back to 70%, some maximalists and hardcore BTC supporters said that “altcoins were dying.” Although ever since this, altcoin values have been outperforming BTC by a long shot. Lesser known coins are also outpacing many coins in the top 20. BCH and ETH’s rise during the last 90 days did outperform BTC, but coins like presearch (PRE 2,641%), cryptaur (CPT 1,351%), htmlcoin (HTML 333%), vetri (VLD 322%), and Digixdao (DGD 308%) did even better.

2020-02-10 16:15:36+00:00	Bitcoin Whale Gives Warning About Inflated Market	[]	"One of the leading traders on Bitfinex and a notable Bitcoin whale has given a warning about the impact of ‘phantom money’ on the market.

How much of cryptocurrency trading is real? By some estimates, only a small fraction of the entire market. A bombshell report in March 2019 found that around 95% of the entire market is fake, as BeInCrypto has previously reported. Since then, exchanges and various exchange data sites have put in stricter reporting standards with metrics like ‘real liquidity.’

Despite these changes, however, one whale claims that the market is still incredibly ‘inflated.’ Joe007 (@J0E007) is a prominent Bitcoin whale in the cryptocurrency world. Often known for topping Bitfinex leaderboards, he’s also been outspoken on rumors in the industry—and often doesn’t hold back criticism.

As Bitcoin breaks the $10,000 price point and the entire market rallies, Joe007 criticized the amount of so-called “phantom money” in the market. He writes: “At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show.”

You can push the price only so long with fantom money. At some point, people would want to cash out their mad gainz only to find no one on the other side of the market. That would be the show. — Joe007 signals·alerts·funds are scams, all of them (@J0E007) February 9, 2020

However, recent metrics seem to contradict Joe007’s claim about this rally being based on the so-called ‘phantom money.’ On-chain investor activity has increased significantly parallel to this rally, as also reported by BeInCrypto. This didn’t happen when Bitcoin broke $10,000 in the summer of 2019, so there’s no reason to believe that this rally is less legitimate than others.

Joe007 is known for stirring the pot on Twitter and causing controversy. For example, last month Joe007 claimed that Binance was outright faking their numbers. He’s also taken issue with Huobi and OKEx faking their reported trading stats as well. A known critic of Bitcoin SV (BSV), Joe007 has also said that BSV delistings may have helped the coin ‘scam pump’ much easier due to low liquidity.

Whether or not Joe007 is correct about the cryptocurrency market’s current rally remains to be seen. As of now, Bitcoin has dropped down under the $10,000 price point and is currently trading at around $9,800."

Crypto S Technological"", 'Economic Implications Are What Interest Him Most', 'He Has One Eye Turned To The Market Whenever He S Not Sleeping.']"	"The cryptocurrency market shows no signs of slowing down so far in 2020. After charting one of the most impressive performances in January, Bitcoin continues its rally in the first week of February as well. In the past seven days, the cryptocurrency increased by about 5.5%, claiming essential resistance levels on the way up. Currently trading at around $9,800, all eyes are on the critical psychological barrier of $10,000.

Bitcoin’s price was rangebound in the first few days of the week, and it dipped to as low as $9120 on Tuesday, February 4th. From there, however, it was all uphill. The cryptocurrency charted a high of around $9,900 and retraced a bit to $9,800. The market sentiment is particularly bullish as $10,000 seems in sight.

It’s not just Bitcoin, though. Altcoins are surging as well. Bitcoin’s dominance has decreased down to 63.9%, which means that other cryptocurrencies manage to claim serious grounds.

As seen in the above picture, not only are altcoins in the red, but almost all of them are marking double-digit increases in the past seven days. Ethereum has had an impressive performance, surging upwards of 23%, while XRP follows closely with 17%. An interesting survey revealed that 50% of cryptocurrency traders hold mainly altcoins over Bitcoin at this time.

In a broader view, the trend of government-backed cryptocurrencies continues. Federal Governor Lael Brainard recently said that the US is looking closely at launching its own. Japan is also reported to move forward with its plans to avoid falling behind China.
